Beastars Final Season,"First review here so please bear with meBeen a BEASTARS fan since 2020. This series alone has gotten me into anime (I know its crazy)And I've been so HYPED when season 3 was announced!Intro is an ABSOLUTE BANGER!!!! The first half of the intro gives off sitcom vibes.In MY OPINION, season 3 handled everything wayy better than the manga didThe examples I can think of is the part where Gohin taking care of the Tibetan fox (forgor her name) is more necessary to the story cuz it teaches Legoshi something. Also Deshiko plays a more prominent role this time rather than just only appearing in...one chapter.Also I had the biggest smile on my face when Gosha showed up. The anime made me love him more! He's such a loving grandfather to LegoshiAnd that's about everything I can think of I'm not really all that much of a critic. I just want to show my love and appreciation to one of my favorite manga series ever.So is it worth the wait? YES it isI think every BEASTARS fan can have a great time with thisREALLY looking forward to the rest of this!"
"Clannad: Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, Tomoyo-hen","I've come to realize that I kind of do like this format. The story isn't anything to write home about. It's pretty simple. However, it's an entire story jammed into one episode rather than stretched into 12. So even if you don't like it, it's not much of a sunk cost. This one deals with an interesting aspect of human relationships in general, not just romantic ones.Sunohara is good just like in the other special. Tomoya acts like himself. If there was a weakness, it would be that the story isn't really deep or special. However, you can't expect much from just a singular episode....It's alright, but I gave it an extra point because I only needed to commit 20 minutes."
Kimi wa Meido-sama.,"nah you gotta pass this one honestly its way too generic slice of life, for people who are new to anime its fine to recommend it to them UNLESS they want some thrilling action pack etc.. well most people prefer to watch those instead so recommending this is impossible, gotta admit every time they release episode every week with other animes this one is making me annoyed its getting in the way to watch other animes new episode, if your asking me to drop it instead i won't cause im not that kind of person to half ass watching anime,yeah maid is assassin which you...will think its cool BUT ONLY AT FIRST, in reality its just front cover to make you grab to watch ityeah its wholesome but its the ""cringe continues wholesomeness"" anime's way that's been common in slice of life genre for years, im used to that already, i prefer unexpected wholesomeness like in dandadan way now, it has more flavor that way,yep in short its boring, obviously anime adaptation to advertise their novel or manga, im guessing this season was 1st stage or arc of the story then next one is about maid was even more engaging fighting her enemies or etcc.. like she's on the run, but that won't be cover in this anime season ofc (i dont' know if it will happen later though)overall don't watch it, if your really interested in the story i think its better to read this in manga cause its less time to waste and manga add elements to the mood (even though i haven't read manga or novel lol)bruh idolmaster shiny colors season 1 and this anime is same ass boring, atleast for me in idolmaster i gain some happiness by watching their MV cause i love MV, its hit or miss though HAHAHAHA"
Cyberpunk: Edgerunners,"Bro... I ain't even know where to begin with this absolute atrocity, I never thought anything could have topped the disaster that was the games launch but the surprise this caused me was MASSIVE, Watching this dropped me to a new all time LOW that it almost caused me to FADE out of existence.Don't even get me started on the writing, a bit of moldy bread could write a better story, the character development just straight up doesn't exist, David Martinez is NOT the goat and the fact that he won't be in the second season actually brings me a sense of relief. man Lucy,...holy mother of life she's such an annoying character, acting all cool and shit, but for what, to cry at the end. such a joke.Back to the fact this is getting a second season, like who the flip asked, show some respect and stop dragging the anime, let it die, everything about this anime just irritates me. game was trash and so is this. I'm appalled that this won anime of the year, literally anything that came out that year was better.Now I have to live knowing that I've consumed such utter disrespect in media form, i'll never have a good nights sleep ever again.an actual disgusting watch."
Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song,"Why are you reading this review and not watching this?Vivy: Fluorite Eye’s Song is one of those rare anime that feels like a complete package, it's packed with action, emotion, and deep themes about the intersection of humanity and technology. From the very first episode, the series hooks you with its world, plot, and vivid characters. It’s not just another sci-fi show, but one that resonates on a personal level.The anime’s strength lies in its emotional depth. It’s not afraid to explore tough questions about artificial intelligence, the value of life, and the bonds that connect us. Vivy, the AI protagonist, is both a powerful...and relatable character—her journey isn’t just about saving the world, but about understanding her purpose and the cost of following her programming versus her evolving sense of self, which was a joy to watch.What really stood out to me was how Vivy kept me thinking about it long after I finished watching. The way the story unfolds across different timelines, constantly building on its emotional layers, makes it impossible to forget. It's rare for an anime to have such a lasting impact. Even days later, I found myself reflecting on the characters and whether or not to give it a 10. Very few anime can do this, and for that, Vivy: Fluorite Eye’s Song is a true masterpiece in my opinion.If you watch anime for emotional depth and complex characters, Vivy is a must-watch. It’s a series that offers more than just action—it gives you something to think about long after the credits roll. If you're looking for an anime that will stick with you and leave a lasting impression, then stop reading and watch it. I promise you won't be disappointed."
Sousou no Frieren,"This was the most boring monotone piece of fiction i have ever watched, no one can ever convince me that this is a good show.The show starts out like Skyrim, sitting in a wagon for what feels like an eternity, only to be given the information that all that could be interesting in a show like this, has already happened.. After that you have to slave through 27 more episodes of ''I'm an old elf i don't care about time'' wich is literally the plot of the show. The main character has no emotion (some are saying its part of the show, but its just...poor writing) The side characters are uninteresting and pointless"
Fate/stay night Movie: Heaven's Feel - I. Presage Flower,"Having finished reading the VN not too long, I had some very high expectations of this routes adaptation as I thought UBW's was great, not perfect, but entirely servicable to the original material.I can only really call it a mess. Started off strong with the anime original scenes of Sakura and Shirou's past until it devolved into a rushed empty, yet flashy, blur. I started tuning out halfway through, conversations would leave out so many details from the VN and then just end and quickly move onto the next scene. Just a lot of flashy animation without any of the VN's substance. I'll just watch...a few of the fight scenes and move on because that's all this adaptation really gets right."
Toradora!,"MASTERPIECE!NO OTHER WORDWatched it for the first time in 2019, during pandemic, was getting bored so decided to watch an old anime (yh 2008 was old for me :D). I actually never wrote any review but.. I needed to, for my first and favorite anime !I’ve been watching it yearly for 5 years now, with the latest rewatch starting on 06/12 (like every year) to have the Christmas episode on Christmas Day. Omg, this anime is just a pure beauty, everything in it is perfect ! Everything ! Even if there’s some flows, my eyes refuse to notice them !Every character is so...well written ! Especially Taiga’s, my favorite character from all anime !This just isn’t an anime, it’s also an emotion and a passion !Will advice this anime to anyone, no matter if you’re a rom-com fan or not.I remember crying for weeks after finishing for the first time ! Rewatched it a month later, to fill the hole it made in my heart !Plot - 9/10Music - 7/10Character development - 10/10Story telling - 9/10TAÏGA AISAKA - 100/10 !Best anime ever for sure ![10/10]"
Mugen no Ryvius,"An ambitious, perilous space opera full of emotional and unstable teenagers. The oft repeated “Lord of the Flies in space” is apt.Infinite Ryvius takes place in the distant future where man has colonized space, it follows a group of about six hundred youths who board a large space vessel by the name of Ryvius to be trained in becoming cadets, technicians, and various other starship positions. Things go awry, and the ship is stranded with its communications disabled. It's up to the inexperienced trainees on the vessel to make the journey back to Earth while conducting politics, forming a makeshift society with its own economics,...and trying to maintain governance and order, but really ends up chronicling a prolonged procession of failings and social collapse. On the largest scale of the conflict, the young commanders of the Ryvius use their one mecha to defend themselves from the military campaign of an Earth government's bureau's conspiracy to have the Ryvius eliminated. A lot of the anime’s space battles serve to spur internal conflict in the Ryvius, aside from this reason these fights take up a lot for the anime are only so necessary. Inside the ship, political strife and power struggle emerges between the head operators of the Ryvius with the relatively technically inept masses on the ship, this paired with the increasing resource scarcity over the few months of the Ryvius’ stranding leads to unrest and violence. On the private level, character drama plays out between friends, lovers, and enemies, rivals, etc. and on the internal level characters face introspection toward maturity, social role, and inadequacy. Considering the juvenile subjects, there's much deliberate naivety to the dialogue and actions. Dramatic points are often focused on emotional outbursts, lashing out at others, tearfully breaking down in fear, or wallowing in a pathetic state. This is all expected given their ages and the perilous situation, but it nonetheless is a dramatic style that perhaps achieves a mean of Uchuu Senkan Yamato and 90’s Shounen manga.Ryvius, being a Sunrise anime of the late 90’s, is done mostly in cel with lots of digitization. The animation is kept reserved and economical, story and content are a tad stretched thin for 26 episodes as there’s notable recap but with thoughtful integration. However, it is wrong to say Ryvius isn’t intensive as often episodes directly follow each other, the cast is large and some important characters are absent for whole stretches of the anime, and the last episode creatively calls back to the first. As for setting, rarely is Earth shown in the anime outside the first episode, most of the anime is set on the Ryvius which has a dull metallic grey and black look to it. Locations on the Ryvius like the deck, barracks, and dining hall are realized well in terms of fidelity and spacing but aren’t terribly memorable.Ryvius is the precise sort of original, ambitious, and relatively dark type of anime to be expected from Studio Sunrise during creative boom of TV anime following Evangelion. It’s of interest as an anime detailing a long and slow social collapse and political emergence as well as the new 90’s approach to space operas but is not stunningly iconic in images, design, or character."
Akame ga Kill!,"Uno de los animes peor ejecutados que he visto. Me he forzado a terminarlo, y ni así me siento mínimamente orgulloso. El montaje de las  escenas y los episodios da pena, como si el estudio también estuviera harto de seguir con su producción. Se nota la desgana en la animación y en la trama. Sé que el manga cambia bastantes cosas, pero, siendo sincero, se me han quitado las ganas de leerlo.Su premisa es buena y, por lo menos, su primera mitad se deja ver sin más; pero su segunda mitad es apresurada, con personajes que aparecen de la nada, ex-machinas por doquier...y contradicciones o sinsentidos involuntarios en las escenas de acción y en los diálogos. Ningún personaje ha llegado a importarme lo más mínimo, y a pesar de que la serie parece vanagloriarse en sus inicios de su crudeza y ""realismo"" no le importa otorgar corazas de guion cuando lo cree conveniente.Su animación no es desastrosa, cuando la hay; ya que en momentos, a priori, de clímax lo resuelven en dos minutos y no sorprende ni visualmente ni emocionalmente. Eso sí, no dudan en perder muchos minutos de metraje con fansevice y trama tipo harem, que ni aporta ni viene a cuento. Además, abusan de las tomas fijas y de las elipsis sin contexto. Los personajes son planos a lo largo de toda la serie y las muertes no importan lo más mínimo.En resumen, no entiendo la nota general de este anime. Me he divertido más mirando la pared de mi habitación. No lo recomiendo para nada."
Super Cub,"""You Meet the Nicest People on a Honda"" - The Hondells in 1965The little Cub, is not just a mere transport tool for getting people from A to B, but it brings new discoveries, new locations, new people, and of all, new experiences.  And this is exactly what this anime demonstrates beautifully.The anime depicts our introverted, grey orphan heroine Koguma, who cycles everyday to school in the small, uneventful, rural town of Hokuto in the Yamanashi, who one day, after seeing her fellow classmate riding to school in a scooter, decides to take the first leap of change by impulsively looking at...cheap mopeds. While most were out of her budget, the shop owner sells her the cheapest Honda Super Cub, a 50cc modped for 10,000 yen (63 euros, 52 pounds, or 66 USD at the time of writing).  And thus, her motorcycling adventure life begins.Super Cub, is not exactly the most original anime, nor is it the most though-provoking, nor is it action-packed.  But what it does bring to the table, is the calmness of everyday life, the little adventures of learning something new, going down a different path compared to your peers, making new friends, and most of all, turning from a grey, to a colourful day.Like the Cub, it takes things very slow, and this is the show's greatest strength.  Life is a journey, taken one step at a time.  Appreciate the little moments, reflect, living in the moment.  This is what this anime represents, the essence of what it could be like to own, and daily ride a little Cub in your high school years.  You're not going on crazy adventures, but the ownership of a Cub, gives you a much greater and wider reach compared to your peers.  And that, in itself, is the adventure.  The adventure of being different, doing something a little bit differently, can bring you great joy, a new found hobby and appreciation in life.  The distillation of the idea, ""freedom of mobility"".There is also the flip side to it.  Not everything is seen through the rose-tinted glass of bike ownership here.  The greatest enemy to any biker (and convertible owner) is the weather.  It can be brutally hot in the summer, the torrential rain of the autumn, the frigid, snowy winter months.  But as spring rolls around, and as the days starts to get longer, you start to remember and embrace this lifestyle/hobby.  And this anime is no exception.  The pain and wallet draining lifestyle.Perhaps it's just me, but being a train and car enthusiast, the idea of travelling literally, the act of moving from A to B in itself, was the adventure.  And as I got older, the concept of ""freedom of mobility"" resonates with me much more.  Being able to go anywhere, whenever, and however I wish.  Taking one road over the other (which was beautifully demonstrated in ep6), finding a new bakery, a new scenic spot, or a nice woodland walk.  While they were accessible when your parents took you there, but here, you can do it yourself.The music choice also compliments this show wonderfully too.  It's very soft, melodious usually, often complimenting the monotony of everyday life.  The cheery, primarily piano backing OST, uplifts the scenes, accompanied by the gentle purring of the single cylindered engine Cub.  The occasional classical music scores were a welcome addition too.If I had to condense it to just one word, I would say this is one of he most ""atmospheric"" anime I have watched in a very long time, and I embrace i with open arms, as I welcome it potentially as my top ten anime."
Jin Zhan Fashi,"I wasn't expecting much honestly, but it's surprisingly fun. Not as smooth as King's Avatar, but if you enjoyed that, you'd probably enjoy this too. The 3d cgi of the game's world bothers me a little, since I'm definitely more of a fan of 2D animation than 3D, but it's enjoyable enough anyway. admittedly the animation quality itself might not be as good as some others in the 8 tier, but I had a lot of fun watching, so it deserved higher than 7Premise is that the MC is a college P.E. teacher who really love martial arts, super dedicated and passionate, but he struggles...getting others interested in it in the current day and age. one of his initial students gets him into the game, binding him as a mage - and then he proceeds to do martial arts instead. shenanigans happen. ye xiu-brand chaos ensues.The characters are fairly fun - the interactions between the Elite Guild, as well as the MC and his ducklings/students are fairly amusing. I gotta say, Sword Ghost (jian gui) is probs my fave character - he's so cute and his va did *such* a good job.fair warning - the sub translations can be kind of iffy at times - most of the time, they do get the point across, albeit some nuances might be lost if you don't understand Chinese, but at some points they don't make that much sense, so keep that in mindAll in all, this is a pretty decent donghua to binge, but don't really expect too-complex plot like bungou or the likeupdate: just realized the original novel was also written by butterfly blue, which definitely explains why I kept getting king's avatar vibes"
Goukon ni Ittara Onna ga Inakatta Hanashi,"This show raises questions:""Did the girls have a plan when they organized the mixer?""""Do they even look that different in drag?""""Where are there boundaries between customers and friends?""""Fellas, is it gay to be bi?""These questions may never be answered, but All-Guy's Mixer manages to keeping the guys flustered by relatable romance mishaps. The pacing of the season has given time to each drag-king to show how they experience their gender, their job, and their approach to dating. Other than the drag bar, the settings for these dates aren't unique, but the variety of personalities among the love-struck guys brings fresh charms."
Vinland Saga,"I think this anime is mostly fine if you are forgiving. It starts off with a very promising story, one that seems of vengeance, but then it turns out to be very different.I have a few problems with that spoil the fun though, they are:1. Thorfinn is a weak protagonist and a badly written one2. Young blonde guy (not Thorfinn) has changes personality too abruptly and it's an unreasonable part of the story, it's almost as if the guy becomes someone else3. Everyone's swearing loyalty to the new would-be king out of the blue is also nonsense4. The attitutes Askellad takes in the very last...episode seems not to make any sense. The consequence of that is even more nonsensicalAnd that's it. The writers seem adept at using plot devices that make no sense whatsoever and they use it to take the story into directions no one was expecting, and it is not in a good way.In the end the results are not very bad and I had fun watching the show, but this had so much potential to be a 10/10 like Sousou no Frieren, no flaws whatsoever, but the writers decided that was not supposed to happen and ruined the story almost completely"
Kaijuu 8-gou,"5.5/10 Decent action show with out the convoluted nonsense.This show was good to binge and I got through the 1st season in one sitting. Honestly this show doesnt bring too much new to the table and feels like a tried and true formula.- Decent enough animation, definitely sub par in fights to JJK or Chainsawman, but still pretty good.-- the action itself was decent enough, passed the better then DBZ test- The pacing was actually phenomenal, never felt slow or rushed- The plot was typical shoenen nonsense of being accepted and the best, but with friends- World building was acceptable and there...was very little exposition dumbs to bore you- Themes of fighting monsters was fine, w/ tech that seems logical enough- Charecters were all pretty standard with nothing to write home about, bit too many cardboard cutouts tho- Little to no good character development from the main cast- Comedy was funny in moments but not the selling point of the show- English Dub was actually above averageSomething to be said, is I weirdly got FMA original vibes from this one. I think it was the humor and pacing, bit unsure from that take but its what came to mind."
Toaru Ossan no VRMMO Katsudouki,"This series certainly is something, but not in a good sense, some very good elements, mixed in with some very bad elements, sprinkled with a whole lot of mediocrity averages out to, you might have guessed, incredibly mediocre. That in itself would not be a bad thing, as the series is mostly a slice of life and a bit of action, with some interesting fights, but I got the feeling the anime tries too hard to be something it 1. Never should have been and 2. Never took the necessary steps to become one. It takes itself too seriously at the wrong places, and not...seriously enough in the necessary places. For example, we have soke scenes with the developers dsicussing events that happened because of our MC, and they seem like some evil shadow organization, while literally nothing happens because of them, but we got some clues on their characters and maybe some intrigue against(?) the MCMinor spoil(this plot also goes nowhere in the anime, dont know about the manga, but it is also incredibly stupid, or I should say they are incredibly stupid).So to rate in a systematic manner:1. Story: Mediocre at best, its mostly a slice of life, so it is understandable that not much is happening sometimes, especially with the whole premise being that a middle aged salaryman playing to relax. But the anime only has two modes, either batshit insane thinga happen in quick succession (with zero plot supporting it, or anything really, it just happens out of thin air but completely changes the game the anime takes place in, like why?) or nothing happens other than some character interactions and some mild skill developing for whole episodes. Again, I dont mind nothing, I like SOL, I also dont mind if batshit insane things happen, but at least have the story actually support and either foreshadow, but at least pave the way for these thinga to happen, not just out of thin air. Also the story goes literally nowhere, but meh, I dont even care about that at this point.2. Art and music: I liked the music, it was not good, but it wasnt bad either, I think they used too little music, but I think it is a matter of taste. The art itself is nothinf out of the ordinary, lot of still shots, with (luckily very little) cgi scenes, especially when there is some people who are not main characters just strolling trough the scenes (I personally noticed 3 such scenes, so not much), luckily the fights are animated normally. So mediocre again.3. Worldbuilding: Kinda ties ino the story, but we got very little info on the world itself, I wrote it up to the slight mystery of the characters and the watchers not knowing fully if its really a game or a game that goes to another real world situation (at the last episodes we get massive clues about this, but I dont want to spoil, also it is not that big of a mystery, I think it was more lazy writing than masterful suspense), but I cant just chalk it up to that, especially when adventuring should be the focus of the story. The anime tries several times to build something but it fails under its own (feeble) weight at that.4. Characters:Now this is where the anime really bleeds out, if there characters would be great, or at least good, the other things I mentioned would have been forgotten (at least by me), but no.Lets start with our MC, who is an obnoxious little shit, having both the mental capacity to make Einstein fear the dark and the capacity of a somewhat retarded toddler trying and failing miserably to open a cookie jar. Examples for the first would be the skill and crafting system in the game, I liked those, and the MC actually got in those mostly without plot armor, it was more of a case of nobody tried it that hard or that way, rather than just straight up asspull ""he is suddenly better at shit skills than other people ever will be, because I said so"". Every character interaction (beside some minor NPC characters) and literally everything that happened in relation to the plot are examples of the latter. Dont even get me started on that we know nothing of his real life, other than some random tidbits (like he has or had depression because of the lack of exercise, and he has allegedly years of VR/MMO game experience). He is very rude to actually pretty good characters, like the Fairy queen, and the dragon girl. The comedy had some moments at the beginning (I want to be left alone, be unassuming = edgy ass bro) + (Fairy Queen loves me, but I only use her gifts and her assistance, but when she tries to comically spend time with me (usually.romantic) I slap her/bondage her/yell at her and run away. His interactions with the rest of the characters are not better, just more rare. We also never really get an established dynamic between the characters, but considering that the side characters have less screentime tham TenTen from Naruto and usually either disappear completely after their episode or just disappear for episodes completely, Im not suprised. They are also very 1 dimensional characters, which is very funny, when you arrive at the end you will see that the Fairy Queen is the best charavters in this shitshow, but she is not even a living being.So, all in all, if you want a slice of.life show with little progression, shit story, an ending that is more of a cliffhanger tham the 90's Stallone movie and shitty characters, I can recommend this. If you are turned off by either of those elements, or the combination of those, I would not recommend.I still gave it a 5, because the slice of life elements and the skill/crafting/progression system are actually pretty nicely done and made it enjoyable all in all, you just have to turn your brain off."
Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3,"Watching AOT for the first time in middle school was an experience, it changed a lot of how I saw anime and would put choices on top 10 lists. I always rewatch it every December to remember how good it really it because there's always details that get skimmed over and forgotten about. Love how well it was made and have enjoyed it since 2017. I recommend this to literally anyone who wants to start watching more or is interested in watching anime. It's a good first anime or even if it's not your first it'll definitely make you remember it."
Naruto: Shippuuden,"Throughout the first part and all of Shippuden, I had to endure the stupid MC and disgusting personality Sakura, which is definitely a downside. But I started watching Naruto as a kid, so it would have been a shame not to check it out. I mostly watched it for characters like Kakashi, Madara, and Sai, because these characters are really interesting, use their brains, and have something to convey, unlike the two mentioned characters. Generally, the world and story are interesting. If Naruto came out now, I wouldn't watch it because of too many useless episodes, but I watched it because of nostalgia. 9/10, and...of course, because of Madara, who remains one of the best ""villains"" in anime.I put the word 'villain' in quotation marks because his goal is the dream of every mature person a dystopia where people would be much happier than in the presented world"
Sousou no Frieren,"This is one of the best animes I have ever watched, and it is also the only anime I have commented on. The story is slow-paced but for me it is perfect.If I could, I would have rated it higher than 10. Whenever I see this, I cry because of how tragic this story is. There are some funny and sad moments in this anime, and like I said, the story was perfect.I would recommend it to anyone looking for adventure, romance, and action. The characters were perfect in their ways, the power scale I think was perfect and I think that everyone would enjoy...this anime."
Acro Trip,"After several delays here we have Acro Trip a comedy of magical girls a relaxing and fun plot that will take away your stress the plot will seem to you without surprise and you see from the first chapter that everyone becomes friends I would have liked it if the plot had been more serious because it gives for that but it fulfills its only objective of entertaining the public, all the characters will fall well as the songs of the OP and ED, the magical girl and her strawberry rose type suit is a charm you will also see the typical evil loli and...the animation is flexible and carefulif you are looking for this type of story I recommend it if not do not leave it for later watch it when all the chapters are on a quiet weekend on the couch"
Spy x Family Movie: Code: White,"I can only sum up this movie like this; give me my 2 hours backIt's absolutely skippable. You can consider it filler if you want. More Spy Family slice of life and that's about it. It's a self contained story that doesn't really change, add or remove anything from the main plot. They just wanted to make something to cash in more on the 'story"".Good points:- Anya's faces were the highlight of the movie for me. Very funny, cute and derpy- Some action scenes were decent (just don't expect Demon Slayer quality)Bad points:- It's filler, nothing important happens for the story...If you really just want more slice of life with Anya, watch it.If you just want to keep up with the main story, movie is completely skippable."
Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season Part 2,"There is no better anime that portrays the senselessness of war and how people always repeat the same patterns, especially as the ending confirms this. It’s the best anime ever made in terms of animation, emotional depth, and message. I highly recommend watching Grave of the Fireflies after this production if someone still lacks an understanding of what war truly is and the damage it causes, especially to ordinary people. I know the final season was criticized, mainly because of Gabi, but in my opinion, it does a great job of showing the perspective of people outside the island. Along the way, I also discovered...one of my favorite characters, Armin Arlert, who I believe has endured the most suffering, aside from Ymir Fritz, of course. Despite watching so many anime, I haven’t found a character who has gone through more pain than her."
Boku no Hero Academia,"My Hero Academia (MHA) isn't really special in any way. In fact, I would say that a non-filler version of Naruto is the exact same story but done better. This is not to say that Naruto doesn't have a plethora of faults, it's just that those faults also exist in My Hero Academia. This was one of my first anime and I got hooked on it for a long time. However, I later watched Naruto and I suddenly realized that everything I thought was original, actually wasn't.This is a review of the first season, but I will also compare it to later seasons because I...don't think the average person is ready to read 7 reviews.THE GOOD:----------------The superpower aspect is interesting in this season and the second. Since Izuku struggles to control his newfound power, it leads to interesting situations where he relies on wit, analysis and resourcefulness rather than brute force power. Izuku's power is also built up in an interesting way. It's superhuman strength, but it comes with physical drawbacks to using that strength. Furthermore, it is clever that the main struggle for Izuku is throttling his power output. This makes sense since Izuku was not born with his power, but inherited it.The theme of ""inherited hope"" is not an original one, but it's still a good one. It is also done well here.There were also some pretty enjoyable moments hidden in there. All Might is a pretty enjoyable character. That's all I can think of for now.THE BAD (a lot):---------------The characters are horrible and the way they interact with each other is unreal. They also have pretty much only one trait and everything they do is based on that one character trait. Everyone is as flat as a pancake but not nearly as enjoyable. Let us examine two characters: Bakugo and Mineta. Bakugo is a talented superhero, but he is a massive asshole. His abrasiveness and rudeness is written in such an exaggerated and unrealistic way that he pretty much acts like a deranged lunatic most of the time. How does the class react to having such a menace with them? Not much really. You get a few comments like ""Wow you are rude"" and they move on. If Bakugo existed in real life, he would be beaten up behind the school daily. Honestly, that scenario would have even made for some good character development. But of course, that doesn't happen here.Mineta needs some unpacking. His sole personality trait is that he's a pervert. As they say ""he wants only one thing and it's disgusting."" The way he acts towards his female classmates is sometimes criminal. He will grope them when given the chance, he tries to peek on them whenever they are naked or changing, he tries to get their underwear, etc. How does the class react? They tolerate him for some reason. Even though he is a menace to all women, they are completely fine with him.Almost all characters are like this. Izuku's personality is I want to be a hero. Ochako's personality is I am nice. Tenya is strict, Tsuyu is honest, etc. They all operate based on this one personality trait they have. I am okay with villains who are boring. I don't think every villain needs to have an intricate backstory. However, for the sake of completeness, it is worth mentioning that the big villains are just evil for the sake of being evil.THE UGLY (fanservice):----------------Fanservice is not a ""thing that happens"" in MHA. It is just constantly there. Most girls are drawn with massive bazookas for absolutely no reason. They also make sure that you get to see the definition and curvature pretty accurately. When they wear their hero outfits, it only accentuates their cleavage. Ochako wears a really tight suit. Mt. Lady wears and even tighter suit. Momo straight up reveals her sideboobs when wearing the uniform, which is very strange since she's the prim and proper lady archetype.The worst offender is the character known as Midnight. She wears a very skimpy suit that gets torn very easily. It has a leather strap that presses on her chest, revealing cleavage even further. She has a whip for the dominatrix fetishists. Also, she makes some really sussy references to how ""youthful"" the boys are acting and it's as if they turn her on. Somehow, this is not a comedic relief character but a serious one.Almost all women characters in MHA are participating in fanservice. By that, I mean I can only remember 2 characters that aren't fanserviced. It's just a spectrum of how egregious it gets. Hell, even the girl who is permanently invisible shows massive boobs when she's wearing her school uniform.CONCLUSION:------------------I give it a 5 begrudgingly. The fanservice and characters are unforgivable, but I don't want to discredit it too much and rate it as bad as other hot garbage anime. It did have some good moments in seasons 1 and 2 after all. Keep in mind that later seasons drop off in quality."
Dandadan,"I waited a whole year for this anime to release and they come out with ONLY 12 episodes!!!!!!Anyways, this anime is hilarious. The story follows a boy who believes in the aliens, but not ghosts. And a girl who believes in ghost, but not aliens. And they become friends through a series of events that they become involved in. And apparently both ghost and aliens exist in this word. 🤷🏻‍♀️✨The art is amazing and so is the animation. I would highly recommend picking up the manga because this artist is soooo good. I was blown away by the art at NY Comic con last year...and since then I have been following it.I started watching this anime, knowing that there are a lot of sexualized situations so I wasn’t taken aback watching that in the anime. But I totally understand if some people are thrown off by it. Even when I went to buy the manga, the shopkeeper was like, “are you sure you wanna buy this?” And I was like, “Yeah I’m buying it for the art and the story is great.”So if you watch this anime and can appreciate how absurd and hilarious it is, with great storytelling and endearing characters, you will really enjoy it. It’s like a fun version of Jujutsu Kaisen, with no stress and no one dying (well not in the present). There is no other anime like this one out there. Definitely give it a try else you’re missing out. 😉"
Natsu-iro no Sunadokei,"This is a fun little OVA that is strongly reminiscent of the era in which it was made, conjuring up nostalgic memories of the medium as it was in 2004. This largely unremarkable OVA, more an advertisement for its associated visual novel, still serves as this kind of time capsule for the cultural atmosphere anime existed in back then, as it was going through the first upheavals of a transition to digital animation, and found itself distinctly within the cultural moment known as the ""moe boom"". Indeed, I'd say much of this anime's value comes in the form of its capacity as an artistic and...cultural artifact, but now that that's been addressed, Hourglass of Summer Colors must be examined on its own merits.Beginning with the story, which is this anime's strongest point, I feel it holds some more substance than many fleeting OVAs of a similar type. It wrestles with time travel, a famously sticky and unmanageable subject, with caution and ease, settling on a system that makes a good deal of sense all things considered. With that out of the way, it goes on to tell a pretty typical school romance story in a dramatic, engaging, and touching way. I quite liked the story, though the brevity of this title really hinders its sense of continuity, with jarring jumps between certain events and explanations only made after the fact.The art is quite nostalgic, meeting all basic standards of quality for the time, complete with the old lovable tropes in terms of character design and how it employs humor. It exudes that clean, colorful aesthetic of the 2000s, and makes heavy use of that chibi-esque, 2chan emoticon facial style for funny moments and misunderstandings, which I found both funny and very nostalgic, as I remember back when that sort of thing was completely inseparable from anime comedy as a whole.The sound exists in a similar fashion, meeting all basic standards of quality once again, complete with the somewhat melodramatic VA work of the time period, with a very specific inflection that they applied to their work at that time. It's hard to exactly place my finger on it, but there's something in the way they speak here that definitively dates it to this time period, and many other 2000s titles, too. Perhaps it's just an unmentioned stylistic aspect, but I noticed and enjoyed it, as it brought me back to sitting in front of the TV at all hours of the night watching any anime I could find in no particular order.The characters are good, if broadly typical for this kind of show, as they broadly serve to fulfill various archetypes, like the clingy childhood best friend who's secretly in love with the protagonist, the overpowered clutzy magic/sci-fi girl who's secretly love with the protagonist, the shy rich girl with strict parents and a kind soul who's secretly in love with the protagonist, and the protagonist who's just your every day high school guy that all these girls are inexplicably secretly in love with. Of them, Ligene and Mana Kawamura are my favorites, Ligene for being a funny, unique character that shakes up the story and honestly just makes the whole thing possible in the first place, and Mana for being a pretty well-written side character and, in comparison to the other options here, also best girl. As of the time of this writing I haven't played the visual novel, but I assume that her's is a potential route in the game. Overall, Hourglass of Summer Colors is a fun little romance OVA with a unique twist, even if it is rather formulaic by the standards of the time. At the end of the day, if you enjoy this era of anime then you'll likely enjoy this particular anime, at least to some extent. In fact, I'd say that a distinct appreciation for the era is probably required to get anything out of this title."
Netrun-mon the Movie,"Like someone else said, this will be interesting and enjoyable for the ones who are interested in old anime and all concerning to the ""old web"", if you are not interested in that difficultly gonna enjoy it and probably just gonna feel it like an bunch of nonsense and wondering why this was made.The character designs are great and that is mostly the principal attractive if you like ukagaka or moe, the story is just like some sort of excuse to show them but it's not a baaad story too!Would recommend to give it a try even if you are not into ""Old...anime"" or doujinshi media but you are gonna be losing the ""principal point""."
Boku no Hero Academia 7th Season,"By now, we kind of know what's going on with My Hero Academia Season 7, but it's insane that they've been able to keep up the high pace of action without really making me feel bored - which I feel was a downfall of a series like Naruto Shippuuden.  My Hero Academia just does it better.  I'll assume you've seen all the prequels for the purposes of this review.Story & Characters: My Hero Academia Season 7's story basically hasn't changed since the previous season.  The new Liberation Front, along with One For All, is making it their goal to create complete destruction...upon the world, but have set their sights on Deku, being the holder of All For One.  Now, with a world threat present, Stars and Stipe, the number one hero from USA has been called to the battlefield and it's up to her to turn the tide of the war.Star and Stripe is awesome.  Very early on, they present her backstory where she forms a bond with multiple army vets, none of which really come close to matching the spectacular strength that she holds.  I loved it, making her scenes on the battlefield all that more fun, along with her quirk.  After her brief arc completes, the rest of the season basically sees us with multiple groups of enemies fighting against each other - akin to the shinobi war that Naruto Shippuuden had.  Most groupings that are create make sense from an emotional standpoint, though does have a tendency to drag the plot a little more than I would have liked.  Toga's fight was one example of this, even though I kind of get what they were going for.There aren't really more new characters added to the roster, even though this season has twenty one episodes in it.  Most of our favourite characters are still present, putting everything on the line - Phantom Thief might have been my favourite from this season, though Shouto, Kachan, Fumikage and All Might are worth mentioning too.  Whoever your favourite hero - or villain - might be, they likely got some screen time here.  Some uneven pacing here or there is kind of to be expected, but the most upsetting thing might have been the ending because of the cliffhanger they left us with.  (Story: 9/10, Characters: 9/10)Art: Animation still feels very consistent, one thing that Naruto never seemed to be able to keep up.  They do all their characters justice and I love how each scene looks and feels.  (10/10)Sound: Sound doesn't disappoint either with the OST bringing in a bunch of new tracks that fit what we are seeing on screen.  I've never been high on the OPs of EDs that this series seems to offer, but that's very minor.  Voice cast continue to be amazing, with Luci Christian (Ochako) and Austin Tindle (Phantom Thief) impressing me the most.  Top to bottom, this voice cast is top notch.  (10/10)Overall: My Hero Academia Season 7 brings the action to the party with basically every episode featuring some fight or another.  Even if you're not a big Shounin fan, this season would appeal to most every audience - it's that good, especially if you've been low on some of the previous seasons.  With only one season remaining, I really hope they keep up the momentum, because it's been an awesome ride.  (10/10)"
Ore dake Level Up na Ken: ReAwakening,"It is basically a Recap of Season 1 + the 2 the early screen of the first 2 episodes of Season 2. Only really watch if you have watched Season 1 already.It skips alot from Season 1 during the recap however it is a nice refresher from what people who had already seen in Season 1. Brings out some of the strongest parts of Season 1 (Sadly does skip some great dialogue that was present in Season 1) like the fights which are still as well animated as ever and this is a great preview of Season 2 and builds great hype for the rest...of the season. The only criticism I would give is that if you have never seen Season 1 already, then this would be impossible to keep up with during the recap and that this isn't really worth watching once Season 2 does air.However currently, this is still a great watch if you would like to get a headstart on Season 2, which starts airing in Winter 2025."
FLCL,"FLCL was truly ahead of it's time with both animation, but also creativity shown throughout just 6 episodes.I will still be leaving it on mixed feelings as it might not really be for everyone, but it is without a doubt worth a watch solely for the classical feel.I had such a hate love relationship with the overall crazines that was taking place with the switching from anime to manga panel was great but went on for faaar too long. Also really enjoyed that they could dwell into deeper meanings about growing up and struggling to find yourself and feeling stuck in a single place.But...as i said, if you are a person that can't really handle overstimulating craizines in anime, this one is not for you!Mainly why i give it a seven is cause they could've gone into more depth with characters and also toned down the creativity to some extent. It was still an enjoyable watch that aged well into today's anime adaptation, still think the story itself could've been made better but the anime without a doubt elevated the source material.Bonus points for the insanely good music!"
Odd Taxi,"Odd Taxi is a really unique anime that mixes mystery with interesting characters. It follows Odokawa, a quiet taxi driver who gets caught up in some pretty strange events. The fact that all the characters are anthropomorphic animals in a gritty city setting adds a cool twist. Despite their animal forms, the struggles and emotions they go through are really relatable.The animation is pretty simple but works well, and the jazzy soundtrack really matches the vibe of the show. It's not just about solving a mystery—it’s about the characters and their stories. If you want something different with a mix of suspense and emotional depth,...Odd Taxi is definitely worth checking out."
Gabriel DropOut,"- hated the mc (Gabriel)- Raphi is ok- the demons carried hard this show- not many jokes, could've been more fun to watch...M.V.P. goes to Satanichia and Vignette was my favorite character.the show is overall ""ok"" if you ignore Gabriel...honestly, even supporting characters and background shadows were more pleasant than this mc 😛...average slice of life with a little bit of supernatural to it, the story is nothing unusual and somewhat predictable but has some funny scenes and Satanichia strikes some really fun moments when she shows upi think this show is a solid 6 because the demons make up for Gabriel's lack of everything personality."
Ousama Ranking,"Ranking of Kings is a refreshing take on fantasy, with a story that feels both unique and deeply emotional. Even though some elements might seem familiar, the way everything comes together kept me hooked. The art style is beautifully fitting—soft yet expressive, matching the tone of the story perfectly. The characters are well-developed, with their own strengths and flaws, making them feel real and relatable. Their reactions to challenges and growth felt natural, adding a layer of depth. I think anyone who enjoys a heartfelt, character-driven story will really enjoy this series. It’s a special one, even for those who aren’t usually into fantasy."
Sasaki to Pii-chan,"At first it's been amazing but after fucking shit, I hate the part of elsa. Absolutely hate that.The story is has very good potential but the animation ruined it and after one two episodes the story become boring, idk it's look like the writer loses his touch. Quite sad, iam seeing this title is unique and have very good potential but people who involved in this project didn't put the right thing.Very sad, hopefully people can appreciate their work more.Animation 3/10 very cheap animations, too stingy. I hate thatStory 4-5/10 I mean why the fuck Marc is began heroine chapters, like who tf...is this guy. Are the writer gay or have ossan fetish?What a waste"
NieR:Automata Ver1.1a Part 2,"What a season! Season one had a rough start with the CGI and the constant delays, but everything paid off in the end. Instead of simply retelling the story from the game, the anime adaptation of *NieR: Automata* introduces changes to the plot that add new depth while staying true to the core themes that make Yoko Taro’s magnum opus so extraordinary.The animation improved a lot compared to season one, blending CGI and traditional styles to bring the post-apocalyptic world to life with stunning visuals. The music, composed by Keiichi Okabe and the MONACA team, remains breathtaking, seamlessly enhancing emotional and action-packed moments. Familiar tracks...from the game return alongside new compositions, creating a perfect ambient for the series.The storytelling shines with its exploration of profound and complex themes such as identity, war, loyalty, and love. The characters, especially 2B and 9S, are given even more emotional depth, making their journeys feel more compelling. New twists and perspectives enrich the story, offering surprises for fans and an engaging experience for newcomers.An excellent way to experience Yoko Taro’s ever-expanding universe, this season is a must-watch for both dedicated fans and those new to *NieR: Automata*. It’s a beautiful blend of great animation, music, and thought-provoking storytelling that leaves a lasting impression."
Shin Megami Tensei: Tokyo Mokushiroku,"There are the times when you play a game, its roots gritty, dark, imbalanced but, overall, passionate and full of life. Then you come across a later entry of the franchise which was able to channel the old spirit, being only a bit more balanced and bit tweaked for the mainstream. Then you see the fond franchise of yours being cast into the 9th circle of Hell and become something that completely undoes the nuance and fondness of the franchise and sends you down a downward spiral of hate, your own Kaz Miller arc. The reason why I am singing the tragic ballad of Fallout...franchise is because, well, I want to emphasize that Tokyo Revelations does not fall under this specific category. But is this a sole reason to love it? Nope. Just because it didn’t fall victim to one cliché doesn’t mean that it didn’t fall for another cliché. Hence here I am doing a post mortem session on an OVA which isn’t really anything. But I have this saddistic pleasure in shitting upon something particular in verbose fashion, hence I rest my case.Shin Megami Tensei may seem synonymous to its derivatives, Persona, Devil Summoner and Digital Devil Saga, a whole damn genre which is pretty interesting and has its own characteristic countenance, but the entries which remains my favorite are the first, the second and Strange Journey. To start from the first game, there is a characteristic plainness that really complemented the game; plainness as in the sort you feel in the soft bops, that is, it gives enough headroom for introspection. For how it is bound to the technical thresholds of its time, it really transcended its potence with a streamlined gameplay design. The premise of the characters involved, especially the protagonist (Kazuya) are simple and clean, no complicated FFVIIR nonsense. You are a teen who woke up one morning and saw a new mail on your PC. And it doesn’t resort to graphic pompadour for its exotic feel either; its artistic influences and the implementation of them in specific troupes are pretty interesting to say the least. The over-the-top troupes of having Imperial Japanese vs Gen MacArthur is an obvious correlation, this isn’t the first time Japanese media used the victim complex card; but what is more amusing is that the analogy is rather a double layered meta humor, which when introspected, gives a better comprehensive study of humans ambitions and its consequences, regardless of political inferences. I can go on about SMT1, but I have to keep it simple: It is a game which makes you to experiment (like Half Life 2) as well as give you headroom to meditate over abstracts.Now, onto Tokyo Revelations, remember the praises I was shovelling at SMT1? Wipe it off the slate, for none of the characteristic elements persisted to the screen. On one hand, I know that the characteristic features of SMT1 shines specifically as a game for it was intended for it, but who doesn’t love to make a cliché microwave spinoff out of a franchise to shill some bucks? A lazy nothingburger which took few characteristic factors from SMT, literally apes CLAMP’s X troupe and ends it like a Pokemon movie, in short, serves as a faithful adaptation of Trout Mask Replica. For a hour of runtime, it initiated too many stuff which was ignored the second it was thrown in; like me picking nuts and raisins out of a damn muesli; and the best part here is, they are either grafted shoujo fantasy troupes or the subject-matter in the games which the screenwriters are too busy to read between the lines.The claustrophobic existential atmosphere, unique to the original game is compensated by graphic details for the sakeof. The plot is just as silly and factitious, the same way how I felt after watching the OVA of Tokyo Babylon to see its neat thematic beauty get overridden with watered down troupes. To be honest, I feel brave enough to call this OVA a neat “attempt” of bootlegging X/1999 but this time, it is Shin Megami Tensei Ediiton; its artistic primers are pretty synonymous to the commercialized Gustav cutouts in Skinner’s office in Ratatouille. To trace the degree to which it reminded me of X, I found the main love arc oddly reminiscent of Subaru-Seishirou, the issue here being the lack of narrative consistency (being gay is fine; but to kill to get your man, well, I’ll pass). Another instance is the scene where the summoners arrive to the school; I am lying if I say I didn’t get reminded of the Seals/Minions introduction in X/1999, a feel of overarching fear and ambiguity. One could argue that adapting a specific thematic style isn’t bootlegging, which I fully agree, but it doesn’t fill the vacuum of a watchable plot. You can adapt a specific style, and construct your own style from the influence. FotNS gave life to a whole thematic troupe, whose use served as a primer to other unique styles. CLAMP is still up there in terms of artistic influence, but this is not the one. In this instance, this feels like just another commercial souvenir born out of proxy artistic notions rather than actual narrative.One thing I really liked about the originals is how abstract and interpretative the graphic description was; let it be the more simpler and normal ones, to very eccentric and chaotic subjects. The simplicity of the sprites went along well with this style. It is not that the game extras official art isn’t a thing, but still the design doc artwork kind of enriches the descriptions. Now, drumrolls please, the OVA did something polar opposite. Few graphic details are reinforced just for the sakeof. It is not that the original game didn’t have a whole arsenal of dark jokes and crude particulars, but it was well-executed and gives a primer for introspection. Here, cliché tagged plotpoints are shoehorned onto cliché tagged characters, using cliché surface-level thematics. A similar analogy I can put forth is Fallout 3, where, in order to reinforce the “mature” tag of the game, you see the unsavory characters use the word “fuck” for a dozen per second, in order to rub the “antagonist” character troupe onto our faces. Unsurprisingly disappointing enough, something similar happens here, for few scenes are present just to make it faintly reminiscent of a complete layman’s interpretation of SMT, deficit of quality, nuance and intent.A shoujo anime adaptation for SMT sounds both richly potent or flaccid pompadour depending upon the decree of the bureaucrats, and unsurprisingly enough, it is a cottoncandy pink day-dreaming to assume the average publisher to market something which is incredibly niche and possibly controversial on surface level. Once we had folks in church preaching against Pokemon, today you have various groups blinded with mere hate. History repeats itself, once with pitchforks, now with either twitter Curry’s paradoxes or /b/’s . That pretty much explains my disappointment in regard to this OVA, for the potentcy is very verbose, but given the mess caled reality, something of that scale of disconnection from the mainstream troupes either dampens the returns due to extreme verbosity, or arouses surface-level false dichotomies and subsequent hostility. The last thing a bureaucrat wants is their net returns to decrease, which somehow supercedes the rationale behind actions.So, well, given the whole shitshow, one may ask why I watched this OVA; well, two reasons persist. One being that I have this sadistic pleasure while kicking down on something and calling names on it, especially when it is a spin-off or a supposed “canon”. Or, a more sober and sensible reason, the English dub. I usually don’t watch dubs, but I kinda stumbled upon this one in its dub and I am genuinely happy I watched it dubbed; for it is yet another “Ghost Stories”-esque American humor appended upon a cookie cutter Japanese anime. I know this is not unique, for there are better instances, but I should admit the comedic timings are damn good and the jokes didn’t feel out of place or overwhelming, for it wasn’t shoehorned to be the crème a la crème. I enjoyed it, and if you like westernized-dubs, you will have a neat watch.Tl;dr – A bland uninspired spinoff whose existence doesn’t mean anything, but it was blessed with a good dub."
Kanata no Astra,"Boasting an excellent production and solid foundation throughout, Astra Lost in Space excels in creating a compelling character-driven narrative. To begin with the former, both the first and last episodes have doubled the runtime, garnering a better first impression and allowing for a proper and satisfying resolution. Moreover, the opening and ending themes were dynamic, being included, removed, or altered depending on what worked best. The quality never dropped. As for the latter, the writing did have a noticeable by-the-book story arc structure, but the fantastic character chemistry and development, interesting worldbuilding, and engaging mystery nearly completely overshadowed this. Go and watch the first episode!"
Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan,"This show has two positives, an ingenious name and a great outrageously catchy opening song.Everything else is quite abysmal. Writing, character designs, animation, soundtrack (or the lack of it), all reek of minimum effort. The ""humour"" is not funny in the least, it relies mainly on trying to pull off something unexpected but lacks imagination and wit almost completely. There was one semi-amusing scene in the first episode and zero in the next two ones. One main character is uninteresting (Koshi Torako) and the three others are plain insufferable. There is no plot, or more accurately, no rhyme or reason to anything that happens. There's...not even basic continuity within episodes.If you want an entertaining well-written gag show, watch The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. If you want funny somewhat unhinged all-girl comedy, watch Asobi Asobase. If you want to enjoy Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan, watch its opening and stop there."
Chainsaw Man,"Chainsaw Man is an anime that exceeds expectations. At first glance, it seems to focus on action, violence, and blood, but beyond the frenetic action, it delivers graceful comedy and emotional depth. Denji’s journey, brutally simple yet captivating, personifies the chaotic struggle for purpose amidst despair. The anime brilliantly translates the manga’s atmosphere with top-tier animation and an impeccable soundtrack, capturing the violent intensity of battles while connecting the audience to its most melancholic moments.Each character gets their spotlight: the brutal Denji, the charismatic Aki, the eccentric Power, the terrifying Makima, and the endearing Himeno. All are carefully developed, showcasing their human side and motivations...to the point where they feel like a family. Furthermore, the anime explores themes such as sacrifice, survival, and the relentless pursuit of happiness and purpose in a cruel world. Chainsaw Man is a visual spectacle paired with a profound reflection on human fragility."
Fate/strange Fake: Whispers of Dawn,"If i was to compare this series to the rest of what fate has to offer,this would be the wierd middle child nobody quite understands. The animation isn't bad by any length, but it's clearly not ufotable. And it will never be ufotable. The most glaring issue i could see quite easily is the sound quality. They failed in quite a spectular manner in that regard. If you watched any ufotable fate entry you know what im talking about. Even the animation as good as it is(not as good as ufotable need i remind), it lacks that ...personal feel any encounter between 2 servants has....OF course, this was more of a pilot then anything,so the actual show/movie might be improved upon.... But even the story for this one is ...wierd? I for one especially got put off by that final scene with who is supposed to be the MC of this series. I might be looking too much into it, and i hope im wrong and it turns out good, but i'll keep my expectations to a low for the time being."
Zhanshen Lianmeng,"Why You Should Watch God of War Alliance (Donghua)Unique World-Building: God of War Alliance takes place in a post-catastrophe world where spiritual energy has been revitalized, giving rise to new realms and powers. The setting is a thrilling blend of ancient mysticism and modern technological advancements, where cultivation isn't just a practice, but a force that can reshape the future. As the series unfolds, you'll be immersed in a world that's both vibrant and dangerous—rich with its own rules, factions, and cosmic energy.Dynamic Protagonist - Ling Tian: At the heart of the story is Ling Tian, a character whose growth is as slow and deliberate...as it is thrilling. Unlike many protagonists in similar genres, Ling Tian’s journey is not one of instant power but of gradual evolution, giving you a chance to truly see his transformation from a simple individual to a legendary force. He’s faced with impossible odds and must rely on his wits, strength, and the bonds he forms to navigate the complex world around him. Watching him struggle, adapt, and grow makes his eventual victories feel all the more satisfying.High-Stakes Battles: The action in God of War Alliance is nothing short of epic. From intense, high-stakes battles between humans and spirit beasts to martial arts duels that test the very limits of cultivation, these confrontations are thrilling to watch. Each fight feels consequential, not just for Ling Tian, but for the future of the world. The series keeps you on the edge of your seat as the stakes rise with every encounter, making each battle more than just a fight—it’s a test of will, power, and survival.Twists and Intrigue - Time Travel and Future Insights: One of the most intriguing aspects of God of War Alliance is its use of time-travel and prophetic insights. These narrative elements add layers of complexity to the story, blurring the lines between fate and free will. Ling Tian’s quest is not only about overcoming immediate threats but also about understanding and altering the course of time itself. Each revelation keeps you guessing about what comes next, while expanding the scope of the world-building in fascinating new ways.Modern World Cultivation with Technological Advancements: If you’re a fan of the modern cultivation genre, God of War Alliance brings something fresh to the table. It fuses traditional cultivation with cutting-edge technology, creating a world where martial prowess and scientific innovation work in tandem. This unique blend makes the series stand out among its peers and offers a new take on the genre, perfect for those who enjoy stories that explore the intersection of ancient practices and futuristic developments.Gradual Cultivation Development: What truly sets God of War Alliance apart is its slow-burn approach to character and cultivation development. Ling Tian’s path isn’t one of instant success—his growth is methodical and often filled with setbacks. This focus on gradual progress adds a layer of realism and emotional depth to the series, making his triumphs all the more rewarding. It’s a refreshing change from the typical ""power-up"" narrative, where characters gain strength too quickly.The Prologue to a Larger Story: Much like Forty Millenniums of Cultivation, the first season of God of War Alliance feels like a prologue—a carefully crafted introduction to a grander, more intricate plot that’s only just beginning to unfold. If you enjoy stories that build slowly but are packed with potential for greater arcs and mysteries, this is the perfect show to invest in from the start.Final Thoughts:If you're a fan of Swallowed Star or enjoy the modern cultivation genre with a strong focus on world-building, character development, and plot complexity, then God of War Alliance is a must-watch. With its compelling protagonist, thrilling action, intricate world-building, and an intriguing mix of time-travel and cultivation, this donghua will keep you hooked from beginning to end. Don’t miss out on the chance to see Ling Tian’s journey unfold—this is just the beginning of something epic!"
Cop Craft,"As i sit here attempting to craft a review for one of the worst cop shows I've ever had the misfortune of watching, I am tempted to abandon the endeavor entirely and never again think of this anime. This show makes me want to retroactively subtract 1 rating point from every anime I've seen as it singlehandedly has diminished the entire medium that is Japanese animation and can be used as supporting evidence to the argument ""anime was a mistake"".The vast majority of the effort and investment into this series was likely spent on a collegiate language experts to create an entire fictional elvish...language, as well as consultations with Tolkein and the writers of Miami Vice. They also threw in a bunch of impressively original but entirely out of place music that never once matched the setting or events on screen. Im talling Arabic-prayer-singing-echoing-through-the-streets-of-2000s-Baghdad-during-a-drug-bust-on-the-island-of-Los-Angeles-2-levels of bad. I don't know who was cooking with this show but clearly they should not be let back in the kitchen again.They set up plot lines and world building that could very well be decent and interesting but then do not follow it through at all. There's some sort of shadow wizard money gang manipulating things in the background at first but then we abandon this thread to iniect classic tsundere loli elf girl tropes and body swap shenanigans because the showrunners evidently thought fans would not have any interest in the story if it was not dripping with constant fanservice of child-like girls defacating in a litter box. The show is entirely predictable as well, you know right away that the loli elf will continue to be kidnapped and captured and put into these predicaments where the scene is pregnant with the threat of physical assault on her body.There is a weird and very jarring use of cgi in some instances and in other scenes there's literally no movement for several minutes as they take every step possible to save on having to animate any movement or speech whatsoever. That could have been forgiven if what the show delivered was in any shape or form worthwhile. Of the friends I watched it with most were too appalled and only half were able to stick it out to the miserable conclusion.The vampire chick was a baddie and the fact that they wasted her presence is also another cardinal sin I will count against this show, she was clearly fixable and it was deplorable how readily the show takes something that could possibly be cool and self sabotage it into the ground."
Lupin the IIIrd: Jigen Daisuke no Bohyou,"5.5/10 - Not as good as ""The women named Fujiko series"", but its more Lupin iiiSo I watched this immediately after finishing L3:TWNFM series, expecting a bit more of the same quality, art and story telling. And tho its technically part of that continuity its a considerable step down in all fields. Very disappointing to say the least, but at the end of the day its on par with most Lupin iii movies of the past, so if you enjoy those you will most likely enjoy this. As much as I have general respect for Lupin the 3rd in a general sense, im not the...biggest fan of the over arching series to be completely honest so this just wasnt for me. However L3:TWNFM series is just a complete work of art and I highly recommend that, I just think they are two completely diffrent products and kinda hard to compare.One of the things that was also a bit weird to adjust to is the English dub voice cast is just diffrent from this movie from that series, jarring to say the least. The art was a step down, similar I guess... but not a spectacle. And the series not having the best writing or story boarding always kept you guessing what was going to happen mostly because it was so weird, and it was more of a origin story more then anything. Where this Movie was extremely predictable as you know the main cast CANT die if it wants to remain at all remotely connected to the main series, which took any type of suspense out of the finally.This was just good enough where ill probably watch the other 2 movies in this mini series... but atleast I will know what I am getting into this time around."
Megami no Café Terrace 2nd Season,"I was deeply disappointed with the second season of The Café Terrace and Its Goddesses.Admittedly, the first season wasn't anything special either. However, after a decade of the 2010s where many great stories didn't get a second season, seeing that The Café Terrace and Its Goddesses was getting a continuation sparked my curiosity. The end of the first season had left the door slightly ajar, hinting at significant revelations to come.Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. Firstly, there's a clear lack of imagination from the author. He keeps repeating the same formula with every girl in the story: they have a relative they haven't spoken to...in a while, and through Hayato, they reconnect. It's the same thing over and over.Moreover, the harem concept is presented in a very dull way. I mean, it's a harem anime, so we all know the girls are going to fall for the protagonist. While Hayato has the credentials to attract them (which is a plus), the girls' expressions of affection are meant to be comedic but come off as absurd. Even more ridiculous is how Hayato supposedly maintains control by rejecting the girls. Unlike other anime where the protagonist tries to be polite, here it seems like Hayato genuinely dislikes the interaction, taking it to an extent that, at least for me (a die-hard harem anime fan), was quite irritating.What's most disappointing is that, as I mentioned, the first season suggested a narrative that would resolve its cliffhangers. But it didn't. By the end, none of the issues from the first season are addressed, as if the setup was irrelevant. Instead, the focus shifts to exploring the characters' backstories.Honestly, I'm not hoping for a third season, and if there were one, I'd think twice before watching it.The Good: The fanservice has increased, and for an ecchi anime, that's a positive.The Bad: Hayato's purity comes across as annoying and irrational.Unexplained: The story introduces a group of girls who are supposed to be rivals to the goddesses of the Terrace Café. However, their presence feels unnecessary. If they hadn't appeared, the story wouldn't have changed at all."
Seitokai Yakuindomo OVA,"A nice addition into the Seitokai Yakuindomo series, overall.Seitokai Yakuindomo OVA presents ourselves with a direct continuation to the first chapter of the aforementioned anime. Saying this might seem more than obvious to someone looking from the outside. But seriously, if feels as if the series hadn't ended at all to begin with. They didn't even feel the need to change the intro and outro of the show at all. The feeling of continuity with this OVA is very much present compared to what the anime tried to pull off later in the second season.All of that said, and having established already that Seitokai Yakuindomo...OVA is little more than a direct appendix to the first season of the show, there's little else I can say about this piece of media that I hadn't previously said in my last review of this intellectual property. It's a nice slice of life show about some girls and boy in high school with some dirty jokes thrown here and there. The jokes are acceptable and the situations can get a bit random at times. It is nothing mind blowing per se, but certainly not bad also. You will have a good time watching this OVA if you enjoy watching these kind of shows.I have seen some people claiming the overall quality of the show dropping in the last two episodes. I, personally, didn't notice such changes and perceived the quality of the jokes, plot and animation to stay on-par through the duration of the show. Which also contributes to my positive rating.If you enjoyed Seitokai Yakuindomo season 1 then you no doubt will enjoy these OVAs also, since its basically the same thing but under a different series, lol."
Rekishi ni Nokoru Akujo ni Naru zo,"It started off subpar and just kept getting worse with every episode. I am afraid of what the last three episodes have in store for us. I'm going to start with the most petty of complaints because this anime deserves it. Why is the prince called Duke? Could you have come up with a dumber name? It's like his parents named him that as a joke because he's clearly a prince who's in line to become king, never actually becoming a duke. Also, I don't think they realize Jill is a girl's name.Now the real issue: Alicia's dedication to being a villain is not within...the realm of what a real human being would do. There are people who do admire villain characters, but with Alicia it's some sort of monstrous anti-social obsession that isn't really justified in any way. In fact, it's not justified at all. She just admired a villain character from a video game. Why is she staking her life on her parasocial obsession with a video game character.Duke and Alicia are the worst romantic pairing for the viewer. Whenever they are both on screen, you just know that Duke will say something that will make you grit your teeth. I am strongly against this romantic pairing because I do not want to see them talk anymore. Duke also has some questionable actions towards Alicia. If someone did what Duke does in real life, they would either get a prison sentence or a restraining order. He has a weird obsession where he hires people to stalk her, he touches her without permission. When he's not doing that, he just sort of looms around like that masked spirit in Spirited Away.As for the rest, there isn't really anything special. There is not much entertainment value because there isn't much action. Nothing of note really happens. The meaningful ""plot"" is just hemming and hawing around one random village that doesn't even fucking matter, or just Alicia annoying the heroine so she can act ""like a villain"". There is an anime called ""Villainess Level 99: I May Be the Hidden Boss but I'm Not the Demon Lord"". I don't think it's great or original, but it implements this exact story in a much better way on every aspect. You should watch that instead."
Rougo ni Sonaete Isekai de 8-manmai no Kinka wo Tamemasu,"Fun premise for an anime. What if someone could freely travel between the modern world and an isekai world, what would you do? What the protagonist does is decide to sell goods from the modern world in the other world, and then exchange the currency back in our world for a heafty profit to save up for a retirement in either world. However, due to sometimes not thinking things through she sometimes gets the wrong reactions from the other world people.Fun characters of course and decent animation, though I will doc points for them somewhat often falling back on CGI for wide shots in...some of the crowd scenes and stuff."

"Shangri-La Frontier: Kusoge Hunter, Kamige ni Idoman to su","The anime is great. Please, ignore the bad reviews.Most of them are crying about “how dying in game has no consequences like the person dying too”, showing that some people here are trying to find SAO-like animes, not game genre animes. In games, being respawned far from the enemy is enough punishment. Maybe losing your items would be great too, but sorry, this is not happening (except for some specific players, no spoilers). Keep yourself motivated while trying to fight enemies and losing continuously is the grand battle of a gamer and there is nothing wrong with it. As a gamer, it is really relatable...when Sunraku tries a lot and eventually win, but with mental damage.Other critics say about how unreal and shitty a MMO like Shangri-La would and I don’t disagree entirely about it. Unrepeatable unique bosses, too strong unique bosses, unrespawnable NPCs and very hidden secret areas are not cool features to a MMO. It is like the author is trying to drag more real life features to the game that gives readers more tension, bur his put at the stake the status of “god game” of Shangri-La. However, as unrealistic it is, I would strongly recommend you to active your sense of disbelief here, because this problem is not really that big to worry about. Think about it, the author is only doing it trying to engage their readers a bit more. A real MMO game would not incorporate those features. This anime is wholesome, it would be a waste to stop watching or being stressed about it only because of this author’s mistake.Lastly, the romance in this anime is pure trash and the extra scenes make it worse. There is no defense here and it is why this anime is not a masterpiece in the end."
Kami no Tou: Koubou-sen,"Season 1 was a blast.Season 2? The sound of disappointment reverberating forever.Let’s break it down:Story: Unique? Maybe. Coherent? Absolutely not. It’s like they had some great ideas but left them tangled in a mess of rushed events. The pacing was so bad, it felt like you were watching a trailer for a show instead of the actual episodes. Predictability wasn’t even an option because the plot didn’t stay still long enough to guess what was happening.Art Style: I wish I could say it fit the story, but honestly, it felt like it was fighting the story instead. The vibrant visuals from Season 1 are a...distant memory, replaced by... whatever this is. A blurry, lifeless rendition that made me nostalgic for the days when art was just still frames.Animation: Do you like PowerPoint presentations? If so, you might still hate this. Even Blue Lock, with its infamous wonky moments, seems polished in comparison.Characters: Well-rounded? More like spinning in circles. Any depth from Season 1 was drowned under a sea of random lines and out-of-character actions. It’s like they threw a script at a wall, picked up the pieces, and assigned them to characters without checking if it made sense.Music: It’s there, but it’s forgettable at best. Remember Season 1’s themes? Yeah, me neither after this.Would I recommend it? Probably not. Even die-hard fans of the series might struggle to get through this. If you’re new, start with Season 1 and pretend it ends there. Honestly, Tokyo Ghoul had a better adaptation, and that’s really saying something."
Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song,"Firstly, If you have an empty and sad life like mine, Don't watch this anime! It'll make you feel more empty and sad!!!!With that out of the way.. I have to say this anime was really quite something.. Every episode was so emotional, And it was not the sort of thing I could watch without feeling such a big emotional rollercoaster..I was looking for something light and cheery and then I ended up watching this so really bad timing from me I guess!But for those looking for a unique story, I think it's a really great thing to watch. It captures alot of...the imagination of what AI might become in the future.. Ofcourse, None of us know for sure but, It's very possible it could be just like this show.Both AI and Humans are put into so many different scenarios and it's really something that will immerse you, But at the same time require you to fully utilise your brain and make you very emotional in the process too.It's a complicated topic, It really is.. And many of those complexities are explored here, And what it means for there to be a singularity, An AI with a mind of its own.If you're not currently depressed, And you want a good story, You should watch it!If you are currently depressed like me, AAAAA DON'T WATCH IT!This anime is so tragic and I don't need more tragedy when I'm in this state!!!Hopefully I can recover from all this soon, After watching this for a few days!!Anyway, That's all ! Watch at your own risk !"
Joshikausei,"There’s not much to see here. That’s a pretty good way to sum up this show.This is a show about three high school girls going about their lives, but with zero dialogue. Just sound effects, music, and any sounds the girls might make.Instead of using dialogue to tell each episode’s story, their actions, expressions, and sounds tell the story. It’s an interesting concept, but pretty strange too.If you’re in the mood for cute scenes with high school girls, this show has a couple episodes of just that, but there are also episodes filled with fanservice, which was a real surprise when I picked it up,...but I'm not complaining. Don’t expect anything super lewd though, just some close up’s of a character's thighs and butt. It never goes pass that, but at least you get a great view in multiple episodes.For what this show is, it’s not bad, just okay. You’re not going to get anything super deep or complicated in this show, just 3ish minutes of cute girls doing cute things together, which is nice and all, but this would’ve been better with dialogue. Having the characters instead make mumbling sounds to provide some kind of communication between them is an odd choice.Overall, this show is a 6/10. It could’ve been done better, but what we do have isn't completely bad either. It’s okay. Not a show I plan on rewatching anytime soon, but I enjoyed the fanservicey scenes, plus it had it’s cute moments, and kept me entertained for a bit."
Happy Sugar Life,"Honestly, I had to finish it because I could not believe it was THAT bad. All in one sitting too. I'm not getting those 4 hours back lol. If you truly think this is a masterpiece, then all power to you, but this is the worst anime I have ever watched.The entire dynamic between the MC and the supporting cast feels like the writer was trying their best to stab themself while they were writing the plot every time that the MC made a decision. I am impressed with how bad it was. Truly a work of art and something that I will try...my best to forget.0/10 would not recommend.~ ANON"
Cheat Kusushi no Slow Life: Isekai ni Tsukurou Drugstore,"A real cute anime about a pharmicist who gets isekai-ed into a fantasy world with magic logic. He uses his knowledge of medicines and modern products to create a thriving producs by making an analogue with magic and potions. He basically pretends like the ideas are all his own and makes a hefty profit by selling them at lower than people ask, but at a high volume and low production cost of gathering materials.Overall it's a nice little anime to watch when you're in the mood to feel cozy. Highly reccomend watching this while doing something like being bundled up with a cup of...coco over the winter."
Overlord,"Nice premise for a series. A man laying a VR MMO RPG decides to see what happens when he's online when the survers shut down. However, to his shock, the result is that he is transported into the world of the game into the body of his OP avatar. Along with this, when he asks his NPC's to survey the land, it appears that they and their dungeon ended up in a different world than the game world. The new world thankfully follows the same logic under the hood as the game world, so the MC, being as OP as he is, basically fucks around...pretending like he knows what he's doing. He, however doesn't know what he's doing, so he goes with the flow and pertends to the NPCs that even accidents were according to his ""masterfully crafted"" plans."
Shingeki no Kyojin,"I will not go into great detail as to why I despise this show. Eventually, I will make a YouTube video and go into great detail, but to summarize, the pacing is way too fast, the characters have no characteristics, and they are all miserable all the time. There is nothing worse than a cast that I don't don't care about. The show quickly establishes that the side characters have no worth. It doesn't dedicate any time to their development. It doesn't make you want to relate to them because the show has absolutely no downtime. The characters can't take 2 seconds to just chill...and have some fun because the show is just plot plot plot plot. Nothing matters except the plot and the main character. Everything else just serves to traumatize him, and make the big reveals in this show seem really dramatic, when with the exception of a few of them, they are all easy to spot.So the characters are terrible and it gives the audience no reason to care about them. Problem with a show with terrible characters is that nothing else matters.The plot is interesting, the premise is enthralling, and the first couple episodes are spectacular, if the characters we even mildly interesting.I thought I would never say this, but this show is in desperate need of a beach episode or something. Make me care about the characters. How do you do that? Show them having fun for a single time in the entire show.And that really is the thing. This show wants you to feel miserable. The only emotions you ever have watching this show are sadness, anger, gratification, and vindictiveness. If you manage to carr for the characters, then maybe you would feel relief and excitement.But was joy mentioned there? No. Because you will never have just some simple joy watching this show.If you want to watch a show that balences the plot with the characters, one that makes you care and keeps you invested, one that is almost as dark and depressing as Attack on Titan, but that has some light, joyful moments sprinkles in between, just watch ""86"". It's phenomenal, and everything Attack on Titan should have been if it had good writers."
Uzumaki,"I've only watched 2 out of 4 episodes, but I can already confirm the drop in quality everybody is talking about.I know where this is going, so I'll sum it up for you: there's a very thin line between horror and ridiculousness. The first episode demonstrated that it is feasible to adapt the manga, and it really is a shame that the poorest animation, the laughable facial expressions and movements and the horrible pacing on the second episode obliterated chance of getting a respectable piece here.The anime would have benefited from ""taking liberties"" and building up some tension, but the way it's presented, you're thrown...into one absurd occurrence to another, feeling out of context instead of giving the eerie vibe of the unknown the Manga succeeds to deliver.Recommended? Not really. It's a bit hard to watch but not unbearable though, it will always be interesting to watch how Uzumaki was adapted, regardless of the result. I myself am actually looking forward to watching the last episode and relive the outcome, and people are talking about how the quality of the last episode is closer to the first."
Nazo no Kanojo X,"Not going to lie, this is one of my new favorite anime. I kind of love the idea of two lovers being able to share their inner feelings by swapping spit....and by that I don't mean kissing, like they actually stick their fingers in eachothers' mouths and tastes eachothers' spit. This can lead to interesting situations like the girl understanding the guys inner thoughts about her, and the guy knowing when something makes his girlfriend happy.Great animation and recognizable character designs. Urabe especially from what I've seen has a little cult following with loads of fanart and fan edits."
Shinryaku! Ika Musume,"This was my first ever anime I actively put on to watch. Somewhat forgettable but a neat premise nonetheless. It centers around a ""Squid Girl"" who tries to overtake humanity, but gets stuck at a seafood job to pay off some debt for property damange. She meets a colorful cast of characters along the way but I'd be damned if I actually remembered their names. I vaguely remember their personalities but now that's all of the anime I remember. It's your run-of-the-mill animation for the era and lower stakes for what it could actually be.Overall it's decent for putting on in the background...to fill the void of silence. Other than that I wouldn't reccomend watching it if you want something to be engaged in."
Dandadan,"ok no doubt masterpiece, watching the trailer first giving me impression its generic plot of supernatural so i wasn't hype much about it (even though people hyping about it) but watching it real time was surprisingly ouwmazing!!!! pure chaos!! even the bgm is worst its helping to become even more pure chaos!!! Anything goes!! wholesome!!! funny!!! beautiful moments that makes you tear up, watching it makes you delulu,look the better way i can described to this is its BIG compact size of genres that its like your watching a movie but longer/extended ver. then while watching that movie you were riding a rollercoaster, mhmm...or other way to describe to this is like piñata from party games for birthdays, full of unpredicted shts just burst out at the same timewelp thats my review and i hope you understands my explanation anyways its an entertaining show and i recommend YOU to watch it. ngl people will want season 2 of this"
Kuroshitsuji II,"This season is abominable. It has no narrative clarity nor compelling characters to follow in terms of any meaningful growth they might experience. Alois Trancy is a revolting sadist, Claude Faustus is a spider demon with a shounen soul fetish, and Hannah Annafellows is a kiddie-fondling cunt with a fake family fetish. Needless to say, Kondo, Sakurai, and Hirano delivered mediocre performances voicing the aforementioned characters, respectively. Also, it was insulting to hear legendary seiyuu Daisuke Ono so brutally underutilized, especially after a stellar performance in the 1st season as Sebastian Michaelis. Same missed opportunity applies to seiyuu Jun Fukuyama for Grell Sutcliff. Sebastian and...Grell were sent off a cliff narratively speaking while the lazy trio mentioned above were given nearly all the spotlight since the first 5 minutes of Episode 1. This season of Black Butler is legitimately an insult to the intelligence of any Black Butler fan of Season 1. As an anime original, this project was a miserable flop. Also, the fact that the Undertaker voiced by seiyuu Junichi Suwabe had little to no narrative relevance was quite vexing. The intro music was solid, and hell the characters that reprised their role from the 1st season delivered fine performances with the garbage script they were given. Pacing of the episodes felt very fragmented and incoherent. Stay away from this absolute anime atrocity and spare your sanity, a friendly reminder to all Black Butler anime fans."
2.5-jigen no Ririsa,"ngl when i see this title firsthand i thought about romance and more on ecchi but then i watch it turns out all time focus on cosplaying (not saying its bad thing cause its actually educational), but good near end of season its starting to get into main thing, like bruh i dont get it why they have to make it into 24 episodes, just total episode 13 is good for this, ngl it feels like their stalling/ roundabout way to get into main thing like romance or etcc but stalling was worth it for sure t it feels like ""the waiting is over""i dont...know how people might like this but ok i guess, their highlight of this season was their cosplay character design too, still 13 total episode is good enough for this honestly"
High School DxD,"Highschool DXD I unironically watch this show for the plot.  The nudity is pretty mid it only adds to it when Issei is being a pervert. I would not watch it in censored though they censor it in a way that's annoying and distracting. The dub in my opinion is better just because its funny it's like the ghost stories dub, but unlike ghost stories Highschool DXD is not boring. The only complaint I do have about the dub is Koneko's actor is not even trying its very annoying how monotone the voice is. Overall you should only watch it if your really bored...and have nothing else to watch or you like breasts."
Himouto! Umaru-chan,"Don’t expect much from this anime, its plot summary is exactly that. Most of this anime revolves around Umaru harassing her brother and being nice around her peers. There is not even much comedy to speak of, most of the entertainment served as more of a time killer than anything. There are some “otaku culture” themes too, whatever that means, but most of it were just references to existing video games. It was decent entertainment all around, the lack of comedy being made up by its cuteness. The chibi form appears to have done the marketing quite well, but suprisingly, I found the non-chibi to...be better.There’s not really much else to say about the story that wasn’t already covered in the synopsis. Himouto Umaru-chan doesn’t really have a story, but slice of life generally substitutes the lack of a story with comedy, so this is excusable. Most of the story revolves around Umaru upholding her appearance of a responsible person in the presence of her peers at school. Conversely, she acts in a completely different way around her brother. This is the supposedly the main gag of the series, Umaru changes her personality depending on who she happens to be around. There are scenes where her brother and friends would be in the same place, so she would have to sort of multitask her personalities. Most of the jokes focus on this premise alone, so it felt very repetitive. At first, her more bratty personality is showcased which is a bit annoying, the later scenes of her swooning crowds helped balance it a bit, even though they too were underwhelming. There were a few scenes that were wholesome when she wasn’t either a brat or this perfect angel but overall the story didn’t have much to offer.Since Himouto Umaru-chan really only focuses on Umaru, she is the only interesting character this anime has to offer. She can be fun sometimes, much of her annoying nature is shown largely in the first few episodes. This does not imply that she undergoes any character development, instead the scenes that show her to be well behaved were simply more present. Besides Umaru, the rest of the characters are pretty bland and unremarkable. There is not much else to say about them besides a stereotypical personality trait. Most of these characters only exist to either give in the Umaru's demands or irritate her. There’s her wageslave brother, a shy girl, her admirer, and her rival. Due to the boring nature of the rest of the cast, this anime was largely uninteresting when she was not on screen.One element of this show that is executed well is its artwork. In general, it’s not particularly noteworthy besides the fact that it is all around good. The artwork features nice colors and smooth animations. Due to the nature of the gag which involves Umaru changing outfits, the character designs are done quite well. The girls in the cast are more notable, and it is easy to see that more attention was given to them during the design. Seriously, all of the male side characters look like they could be background characters. Anyway, Umaru’s outfits were certainly the best part of the show. Watching her designs vary depending on the scene she was in was quite nice. I had a personal preference for the design she wore when she went to the arcade. The OP was great too, great music with some video game references.In conclusion, Himouto Umaru Chan is a fairly decent anime all around. There is no noteworthy story or plot to speak of. Instead, this is substituted by comedy, which relies on one gag and gets repetitive after a while. Most of it relies on how cute Umaru's chibi form is, which can be annoying, and in turn make her non chibi form more appealing. The other characters in this anime are quite bland and lack personalities of their own so their character mostly involves feeling a certain way towards her. The artwork really saves the show here, which can be seen by how this show is presented, the girls’ character designs, and the OP that preceded."
Hajimete no Gal,"Somewhat forgetable anime about a guy who manages to score a girlfriend whos a ""Gal"". The whole series basically centers around hoe he tries to loose his virginity to her and stuff that gets in the way with that. The dream sequences of the MC's inner selves arguing with themselves over if they should act horny or like an acutal loving boyfriend to his girlfriend.Average animation, nearly forgetable characters. Still a somewhat decent watch for thoes who are bored enough to put on something in the background. I watched the sub for this though at the time so I had to actively watch it...to understand what was going on in the plot."
Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt,"Great show with great characters. I absolutely love the premise of an anime parodying raunchy and mature north american cartoons. It's like an inverse of Avatar or Teen Titans. Supposedly, contrary to popular belief, it wasn't inspired by South Park, but rather Drawn Together of all cartoons. Definately a breath of fresh air compared to the regular hyper-sexual/wildly innaproperate anime where they pull the same tropes over and over for the sake of fanservice. Also, while the designs are simplistic, the show has some of the best action sequences I have ever seen in an anime. The nonsensical plots of each episodes too are another...breather from all thoes episodic anime that somehow still have an overarching plot for no reason. Sure there's a sub-plot, but it's like Scooby Doo where it's just a setup for an episode's shenanigans."
Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 3rd Season,"Re Zero is a masterpiece. This season has greatly expanded on the lore of the sin arch bishops and doesn't seem to drag out like season felt like sometimes. I will say there are some iffy parts like the whole regulus exchange in dialog.Short answer If you are a Re Zero enjoyer you will love this season, if you like fights and not cgi dragons you will love this season, if you like motivational shows you will love this season, if you like well written characters that make human decisions you will love this season, if you like anime baddies you will love this...season, and if you like thought provoking mysteries where you the viewer will have to pause the show occasionally in order to brainstorm you will love re zero. In other words most people will love this season, the only people who won't are the ones who have a stick up there or some weird grudge."
Shinryaku! Ika Musume,"About as good as a comedy anime could hope to get. The show is very reliant on it's protagonist, and a lot of the comedy comes from each side characters unique relationship with Ika Musume. Although this could be a weakness, Ika Musume it works, plus all the characters are unique and interesting in their own ways, but having them play off Ika just works so well for the comedy of the show. All the other characters interact with one another in unique and interesting ways as well such as Sanae and Cindy becoming fast friends due to their infatuation with her. It really plays...off of character dynamics masterfully, it didn't get stale in the 418 chapters of the manga and it definitely doesn't get stale here. The show also has a lot of genuinely heartfelt and sentimental moments. The mini Ika episode which came out of nowhere was a well made standalone short story that almost made me cry (okay to be honest I actually did cry). I think my issue with a lot of other comedy series, My Deer Friend Nokotan comes to mind, is that it never really takes the time to have you grow close to the characters or make their relationship seem genuine, but in Squid Girl seeing Ika Musume grow closer to those around her and become a member of the Aizawa household is really sweet. I think theres a line in episode 10 where Takeru has to draw a family member for a school assignment and Chizuru says ""why not draw Ika Musume, she's basically a part of our family now right?"" That moment really cemented this show as something special in my mind, it's doesn't just work as a comedy but it really is a heartfelt show. Ika may never invade the world but she's invaded my heart (corny I know, I just love this show so much)10/10 one of my favorites"
Azumanga Daiou The Animation,"This is indeed a review. Everything that is stated is my genuine opinion, which I think I need to say so people know this is not a shitpost review. But, I will keep it short(ish).Azumanga Daioh was a comedy manga serialized by Kiyohiko Azuma, an anime produced by JC Staff in 2002, and a series viewed by only the coolest people on the planet for the last 22 years. I love Azumanga Daioh with every fiber of my being, I live and breathe it...and it's a show you can view any time of the year without feeling an ounce of boredom. Even so, stating exactly...why the series is good is a lot more difficult to do than simply proclaim. At the surface this really is just about some Japanese girls who went to high school. Some may sit through it and end up hating it by the time it's over, some on the other hand are chemically entranced by it. Allow me to explain...Plenty of people take a look at shows like Lucky Star and Nichijou; which are already pretty popular animes in their own right. They dismiss them as boring or dull with no additional spice to it because of how slow paced it is. Sadly, people who generate these tired complaints are anime fans who stick solely with fast pace shows extending across multiple seasons. And no, I'm not here to hate on people who like shonen. I'll suck off Chainsaw Man all day and admit Jojo was ahead of it's time for the anime medium. But I digress, the slice of life genre has its own set of charms it brings to the table you can't find anywhere else. So what exactly is a slice of life? It's a depiction of mundane experiences in art and entertainment—more akin to melodrama than drama. Basically, a slice of should highlight the aspects of daily lives for an audience while utilizing both humor and the unique capabilities animation to mix boring daily life with ridiculousness.Let's apply that to Azumanga Daioh. It's important to note that humor is an important element in most slice of life shows and Azumanga Daioh excels in this area and is first and foremost a comedy that's ACTUALLY funny. In fact, the manga is written in four panel form which is the Japanese equivalent of a newspaper comic strip. This allows for comedic timing and condense storylines to play a significant role in telling jokes. It's because of this Azumanga Daioh has a very unique way of making jokes and being humorous, in which I believe is translated as well as it could be for an anime. Ever tried translating scenes that were originally derived from comic strip pages with 4 panels? It's not easy!And of course, there's the wonderful characters that stand the test of time. Azumanga Daioh being able to earn a place in the hearts of many for so long is for this very reason, and can still be enjoyed decades from now. I don't have much to say about them because that'd ruin the whole experience, but what I will say is each one of them and their individuality make the anime/manga as good as it is. Osaka namely being one of my favorite characters is indeed a testament to the goofy nature of this series. In short, Azumanga Daioh is all about the interactions between these girls enjoying daily life in high school. It's really an adventure, and just watching them grow up and go to college is a treat I think everyone should enjoy.Just watch it."
Shiguang Dailiren,"The story is great, but the English subtitles are so bad that I can't connect with the anime as much as I'd like! It's such a shame! I'm tryin to dissect sentences meaning! You know the feeling when you know the translation is different or wrong even though you don't understand? I'm getting lots of it while watching! plus the fact I'm not used to Chinese speech... the Japanese dub is much better, but my Japanese is not that good and the struggle still remains. towards the end of the season maybe the conversations became less complicated and I hope the translation was correct.Anyway,...I was hesitant to watch Chinese anime, but now I'll have to wait and see whether good subtitles will come out. I think even Korean anime translation is better than this. If I knew Chinese I'd definitely would've edited the subtitles.I translated the phone message in episode 10 with google translate and it was exactly the same as the subtitles! They should thank google for doing the work I guess?"
Watashi no Oshi wa Akuyaku Reijou.,"As a person who absolutely loves the manga, this anime cropping up unexpectedly in my notifications last year was a pleasant surprise. WataOshi, as the basics, is mainly about a girl who plays a visual novel, not to choose the ""best boy"", but because she has a crush on the villainess. Like someone who stans their waifu, Rei dedicated her life to her favorite character. However, one day while playing the VN late into the night, she passes out and wakes up isekai-ed into the body of the MC of the game she plays. Now while one would think they'd wanna keep the balance of...the world or something like that...Rei does the realistic thing we'd all do in her situation, and breaks the flow immediately by confessing her love to the villainess, Clair.While the animation isn't anything to write home about and the dub is apperently controversial, (I'm autistic, so any dub is serviceable unless it's noticably a non-fitting voice compared to the character design), it's still a fun little watch for people who enjoy the yuri category of anime."
Kengan Ashura,"You come into this kinda show expecting pretty crazy matches and fighters. It delivers on that front for sure, but it falters on other fronts. While I found the matches entertaining for the most part, it's pretty bogged down with fighting tropes and fight filler/flashbacks.Starting with the characters, I enjoyed them for the most part. You've got a lot of tropes. Stoic protagonist with a troubled past, obsessed rival, mad doctor, and cop obsessed with ""justice"". There's some interesting stand outs as well though. I'd say for the most part, the characters are interesting enough, and meet the quota for this type of show.Plot wise...it's a ridiculous tournament to facilitate the fighting. They have some side plots going on, but I would say the overall story is secondary to the fights.So what of the fights? For the most part, they are good. They for sure follow the trope of one character getting beaten to brink of death, only to finially figure out how to win and turn it around. Not all the fights, but a lot of them do follow this formula. It can sometimes be unpredictable who will win though. I would rate them a lot more highly, but in the second half of hte show they spend a lot of time on flashbacks during the fights. They are more like moving slideshows actually, since they are animated so little. It could be seen as a stylistic choice, but it's for sure not something I want to see interrupting the fight. Honestly, without those I may have even upped the score a number and be able to fully recommend it.As it stand though, I enjoyed the show enough and will move on the season 2. If you are wanting more than just ridiculous fights, then you won't get much more here. Also, the flashbacks are quite annoying, so that could ruin it for some."
Bleach,"I just finished bleach today, and here's what I have to say about it.Bleach is a truly captivating anime that leaves a lasting impression with its unforgettable characters, thrilling battles, and a richly crafted world. From the moment I started it, I was hooked by the vibrant art style and the intense opening arc that sets the tone for the series. Watching Ichigo Kurosaki grow from a rebellious teenager to a courageous Soul Reaper was nothing short of inspiring.The series excels in creating high-stakes conflicts, particularly during the Soul Society and Arrancar arcs, which are packed with jaw-dropping battles and emotional moments. Each character is...well-developed, and their backstories add depth to the narrative. Favorites like Rukia, Byakuya, and Kenpachi bring unique energy to the show, and the dynamic between Ichigo and his friends feels authentic and relatable.That said, Bleach isn’t without its flaws. The pacing can be uneven at times, and the filler arcs, while sometimes entertaining, occasionally disrupt the flow of the main story. However, these shortcomings are overshadowed by the anime’s sheer heart and ambition.The soundtrack deserves special mention, as it elevates every scene, from the quieter emotional beats to the adrenaline-pumping fights. Bleach’s themes of duty, friendship, and perseverance resonated with me, making it a must-watch for any anime fan. It’s a classic that I’ll remember fondly for years."
Koe no Katachi,"A great anime that portrays the real life ways people with disabilities by their peers, as well as people coming of age and realizing the ways they wrongfully treated others in their youth...along with thoes other people who refuse to change and continue to be complete asshats.Not to even mention how beautyful the animation is and how well the voice actors/actresses played the characters (I did watch the dub). I actually like how in the dub, the voice acress for the main girl is deaf irl.I highly reccomend this series to anyone who likes slice of life stories that can tug at the...heartstrings."
Gokicha!!,"It's not awful, and if you have 14–15 minutes to spare, you could watch it. A cute anime about cockroach girls and the struggle of being a roach, the plot is not very deep, nor are any characters, and I wouldn't say it's too funny. It doesn't take itself too seriously and if you're looking for something extraordinary, this is not it. Most would call it a waste of time, but it's not that unpleasant . Just okay. A plus is if I say the designs of the roach girls are pretty cute. The art- style isnt very unique, typical anime from the 2010s."
Shinreigari,"I’m a big fan of the writer Chiaki J Konaka, who is most well-known for his work on Serial Experiments Lain and his socially undesirable political views. Personally, I appreciate his work on Texhnolyze the most, a “Nietzschean” post-apocalyptic series about an underground city where several factions compete for power.So I figured I would try watching Ghost Hound, which was written by Konaka and produced by the guys who did Ghost in the Shell -- a dream lineup, frankly. The concept sounded fine as well: a few teenagers who have issues with their past explore the line between the phyiscal and spirit world.The...problem? It sucked.First, there is not enough antagonism: there are occasionally threats or fights, but there is never a consistent source of tension or conflict. The protagonist is also fairly boring: both in visuals and personality. Combined with the fact that things happen too slowly in general, this leads to an overall dull and boring watching experience, despite the fact that the mysteries in the series are fairly compelling in their own right.In my notes, I wrote down that the art and sound were both great, but both failed to leave an impression on me 2 months after writing them."
Girls Band Cry,"3DCG in anime = bad? FOR ONCE I can say that this isn't the case! I know there are other examples of good 3D CG anime out there but this is the first one I've touched that I personally enjoyed.Plot is decent and takes a realistic approach to the indie music industry, its honestly quite relatable in certain levels, the MC leaves a bit more to be desired at the start and I can certainly understand why someone would drop it at episode 1 but trust me when I say ""let her cook"".Visuals/Animation, I never thought I'd see the day where I'd enjoy 3DCG...but this one just does it in its own stylistic way. Its not trying to be a 2D anime, its conscious of what it is and what its good at, instead of trying to pass itself as a 2D drawn anime. They did an amazing job animating this!Music, all opinions here since tastes are different, but boy did I enjoy it. Their songs have a clear direction/theming or style. Those quick bursts of words are their iconic signature and they wear it proudly on all their songs."
Dandadan,"Dandadan is not a ""fan-service"" Anime: a Defense on Sexually Explicit Content.TL;DR: Contrary to objectifying women or promoting perverse ideas, Dandadan is actually putting its strong female lead into danger to deliver a powerful feminist message in the face of a fictional world that is unrelenting in portraying the dark side of reality.Yes, Dandadan is not an anime, on a random Friday night, that you could comfortably plop your parents down on a couch to watch together as a family. (Neither is Game of Thrones)That said, those in the anime community should be used of this. The mainstream Anime industry has rarely done sexualization...in a ""conservative"" sense: so far, the most (perhaps a bit pitifully) we could expect as a community, is that an author fanservice both sides of the male & female fanbases, to preserve some sense of ""equality"". In that sense, at least, Dandadan is a step in the right direction.It doesn't concentrate strictly on putting the female lead Ayase Momo in sexually explicit scenarios, but does so to Ken Takamura as well. Ayase is rarely ever portrayed as a typical ""damsel in distress"" that is vulnerable to sexual exploitation as is frequently the case in fiction for much of the last century: that was made clear from episode one. by far-- Ayase was the MVP, the parallel of her failed kick on her gangster ex, to her successful kick on the Alien assailant by the end of the episode is a clear sign of her strength-- and implying to a female audience of a similar capacity lying within themselves. Neither Ayase nor Ken are strong from the beginning, but rather-- through diligence and effort, they achieve the strength to defend what is precious to them (in this case-- rather literally). Furthermore, this show, at times-- shows flashes of brilliance, demonstrating a maturity and thoughtfulness that many would not have predicted on their first impression.Rather than skirting around the adult content, writer Yukinobu Tatsu doesn't hesitate to attack it directly. The plot of Dandadan doesn't retreat from giving the consumers ""discomfort"", and truth be told, as someone who comes from a very conservative past-- it doesn't feel like there is some hedonism underlying the ""fan-service"". Rather, the show seems to be mature in admitting that life sucks, rather than pretending the world a perfect place free of all sin and misconduct.Episode 7 of this show is the principle example of this ""attack"" mentality surrounding the dark side of life. The author's efforts to make the experience of the struggling single mother as visceral and gruesome as possible, was-- at least from my perspective-- a nuanced attempt to shock the viewer into empathy. In life we are too often desensitized to the explicit suffering of others. Yukinobu Tatsu's work, especially in the plotline surrounding Acrobatic Silky's human life, can definitely be argued to be deep and meaningful (contrary to some opinions that this show is merely made for commercial interest). Evoking a similar effect as the famous war-poem ""Dulce et Decorum Est""-- forcing the consumer to suffer through an experience-- shocking their empathy awake.Overall, there is a lot of sexually explicit content. However, I will appeal, to the many people who have dismissed this show on the basis it is adhering to the idea that ""sex sells"". It is truthfully deeper than that. This show is worth gritting through the discomfort for. Ultimately, there is an unpolished diamond lying at its core. Beyond the sexual content which is miring the show's reputation, there is a distinctly feminist message... Strength is not assigned by sex, it is earned through courage and growth."
Kimitachi wa Dou Ikiru ka,"So The Boy and the Heron is… okay. Beautiful and winningly surreal, and the animation has the kinds of flourishes you both would and wouldn’t expect from a Miyazaki film. The backgrounds have this quality to them clearly influenced by the modern and surreal art periods that I certainly vibed with; the heron himself is a delight.But the story doesn’t quite come together in that particularly human way he often excelled at, mirroring reality and expressing its truths through the most fanciful, inspired of “lies”. It reads more as a vague, stubbornly continued message for children to face life’s struggles and the inevitably of loss,...which… makes sense, seeing as he explicitly made this one for his grandson and I imagine for himself in his twilight years.Ah well, it’s not like I expect a director’s best work in his eighties. And again, it was pretty.6/10"
Ao no Hako,"What is the point of investing so much budget in an empty anime like this ?Blue Box is the basic japanese romance anime there is. If you watched another romance in the anime format, you already watched Blue Box.Nothing happens, cliffhanger bait every episode where you may think something is going to happen to have nothing at the end but a thought like ""She might like me"". No actions are undertaken by both MC, it's constantly the same scene happening, a situation gets created where both MC are about to do or say something that may advance the relationship or change the story, and...they just don't. And it constantly stagnates like that.The sport is supposed to take a big space here, it doesn't. It's totally at the service of making the characters look good and make it look like the story is advancing when it doesn't.This. Is. BORING.This is clearly the work of someone who doesn't want to write anything related to the romance itself, just a slice of life filled up with baits here and there that make you think the situation might change, but it never does.You end up with a mid anime that is not invested in sports, not invested in romance, and not invested in slice of life neither. Just a little bit of everything without being interesting in each of those fields. Jack of all trades, master of none.Story: 1Character: 1Animation: 7Music: 3Frame (everything around the characters): 1Overall: 2A waste of time."
Tokyo Godfathers,"Watched in film clubUsually I revisit this movie only around Christmas day, but whatever, doesn't hurt for me to watch it twice in a year.As much as I love everything that Satoshi Kon did, (after all I consider him my favorite anime director) I really wish he would've done more down to earth human dramas or comedies in his lifetime. Because honestly, by this point I'm starting to feel like Tokyo Godfathers might just be my favorite work he's done. It manages to pull nearly every strong emotion out of me when it wants to, and the more I've now watched it the more I...keep realising just how well this movie is put together with it's narrative and writing. Every line of dialogue and action that the characters take or deliver leads them to somewhere in a way in which it feels purposeful for the overall narrative and it's themes. It manages to tackle everything in it's runtime from poverty, to faith, to coincidence, to family, to even transness, and most importantly with a Kon film, dreams. Now granted the depiction of a trans character doesn't feel fully realised and could use a slight bit of nuance, after all this was still 2003 and some of the topics regarding it were still a little muffled. However I honestly feel as though Hana's character is one of the best things in this film, and especially for it's time probably the best representation of a character like her. She's kind, thoughtful, has her own aspirations, yet is also flawed just like any human would be, and her gender identity is never mocked in a way where it'd be played for laughs. Kon was always great at writing characters, and Hana might just be one of his best in my opinion. Although my personal favorite out of the cast is definitely still Miyuki, as I honestly find her to have a lot of the most charming, funny and especially sentimental scenes here. She might be my favorite depiction of a teenager in an anime the more I think about it. It feels like her emotions and actions truly reflect what it's like to be a young person going through these alienating and confusing times in their life. Gin is also pretty fantastic, even if I don't have as much to say about him personally. In some ways I'd probably consider him to be the funniest character, as his drunkard antics and certain sarcastically delivered lines of dialogue get some pretty good laughs out of me. Point is, all of the characters whether bigger or smaller feel extremely genuine as well as grounded in reality, and watching this movie specifically always reminds me just how good Kon was at character writing. On top of writing though, Kon also knew how to direct and bring his projects to life in extravagant ways, which is exactly the case for Tokyo Godfathers as well. The highly expressive animation of the characters never fails to both entertain and impress me with just how perfectly they are drawn to fit certain emotions or moments in here, making for some really funny yet also emotionally tangible moments. The urban environment of Tokyo in a way also feels like it's own character in this film, as it just oozes with so much personality every second, never failing to make it feel like a living and breathing space for the characters to move in. The climatic end chase of this movie can truly highlight that aspect, which for the record is one of the best and most thrilling chase sequences that I've ever seen in any film.Overall there's a lot to talk about with this movie, and I could probably continue on rambling about it for a good two hours, but I'm gonna stop here as I feel like I've made a lot of my points pretty clear already. Words alone can't express how much I love this film and feel connected to it"
Beastars Final Season,"One of the things you want to see in an anime adaptation is what it can do differently or even better than the manga, this without of a doubt meets both of those. I am obviously going to have a little bias with this IP being my all-time favorite, however, even with that there were a few things I can acknowledge that are left to be desired in the source material.This review contains spoilers, however, the TL;DR will remain spoiler-free.TL;DR: Season 3 brings a mix of slice-of-life world-building and mystery angles that the previous seasons displayed. The issues the manga had with pacing and the...commonly phrased issue of, ""distractiveness"" in my opinion, are nowhere to be found. It is clear Studio Orange cares about this property and knows exactly how to form a clear vision for this series. Not to mention the intro (like all other seasons) is an absolute banger, and the artistry is uniquely Beastars. If you like navigating moral issues and witnessing/relating to awkward situations (even adding a bit of action in there), then I can not recommend this season of Beastars more.Story/Plot: 10/10 - This show took what was a clear vision but in parts into a single coherent vision that shows what Beastars is meant to be. The scenes in every single episode blend beautifully and naturally with the next, adding to the character's depth in not only their own growth/mindset but in how they are holistically placed in the world around them. The major elements that were switched around from the manga like Melons incorporation with the Shishi-gumi (and subsequent rewriting of the Reapers Drop scene) and the reimagining of the concept of drugs (giving a bigger purpose to the ""Bloodbone Drug""), adding a new realistic in-world dimension of how things operate. It can be argued thats what the black market's function was to convey, however, I argue it still does in which it represents harsher drugs while the tamer stuff introduced is exactly that, tamer. Granted, even with the praise and 10/10 score for the plot, it does go without saying that this season does end on a nasty cliffhanger (literally) but, I am completely fine with this as it is confirmed this isn't the end of the show.Characters: 10/10 - Every single new character introduced in this season is perfect, they aid the themes, and drive the plot forward meaningfully. Seven (Sebun), Yahya, Gosha, Sagwan, Leonna, Melon (and yes even the little poop guy); they all play important roles in adding dimensions to Legoshis character development and showing the different perspectives that make up their world. Going more into legacy characters, the developments of Louis, Juno, Haru, and even the whole drama class was very refreshing and reminded me of why I love this series.Music: 10/10 - The intro is (as expected) peak as per usual with Beastars, even the outro has an amazing piece accompanied by pleasing visuals. Most of the classic scores from the first season make a reappearance accompanied by new appearances making a great catalog to choose from. Granted, there is nothing super special about these scores or leitmotifs, but, it does its job as being an aid to the scenes and setting up the audience to expect what the motif comes with. All-in-all the music is undoubtedly one of the best components of Beastars, as those who detest watching the show still admit the intros are bangers.Art/Animation: 10/10 - This is the component I most love about Beastars, from the very beginning of the adaptation studio Orange experimented with stop motion, watercolor, and the mixture of 2D/3D animation. Season 3 brings what I missed in season 2, being a new vibrant experimental intro that is pleasing to watch. Also, as mentioned earlier with the outro, the paper-mache cutouts is very cool to see. In terms of the animation in the show itself, every aspect from previous seasons has also been improved. The choreography, camera work, facial expressions, just everything I can list. The only part that tells me it could've been better if they maybe experimented more in the actual show with different art styles like season 1 had, but, I got more than enough of that with the intros and outros.All-in-all I thoroughly enjoyed this season and it marks a great addition to the series. Can't wait to see what meets us in season 2!"
Hoshifuru Oukoku no Nina,"For the first time in for ever  I am writting a review!I love this anime.Nina the Starry Bride has brought back meaningful romance, It shows that what I was missing so much in an anime... it feels nostalgic and fullfilling, the way it makes me care for the characters and how hard itnis to root of a love story just means it is written masterfully. Romance anime have been dull lately but this one is so worth the watch I am willing to read the livht novel if there is one!Thank you for the author and director of this anime.I love the...plot, the setting of the story and what happens with each character."
Zombie-ga Doeeo Beorin Naui Ttal,"Great anime, based off a great and heartwarming webtoon. My only gripe is that the animation budget seems more shoestring than it deserves to be. Has some ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""iZombie"" vibes if anybody on this site watches anything other than anime.One caveat is it's only in Korean with no available subtitles, but its nearly beat-for-beat the webtoon, so if you read that you'll get the gist of the dialogue. It can be found on Netflix Korea and AniKids EBS...and nowhere else. Props to the studio for making an anime that's unironically impossible to pirate due to region lock and lack of...interest. I'm just glad this at least exists since I'm a fan of the original webcomic."
Dragon Ball Daima,"I feel that watching the TV series along with reading the manga gives a really different experience. I've recently been reading Japanese manga on Web Manga as well.https://www.mangaseeker.com/manga-6537/index.htmlThe series is filled with action-packed battles, heartfelt friendships, and profound life lessons. Goku and his companions face numerous challenges and villains, including the evil Frieza, the powerful Cell, and the enigmatic Majin Buu, all while growing stronger and discovering their true potential. With its engaging storyline, memorable characters, and vibrant artwork, ""Dragon Ball"" has become a timeless classic that continues to inspire and entertain fans across generations.""Dragon Ball,"" created by the renowned mangaka Akira Toriyama, is a...Japanese manga series that has captivated audiences worldwide since its debut in 1984. The story follows the adventures of a young boy named Goku, who possesses extraordinary strength and a pure heart.

Leadale no Daichi nite,"Ever since SAO, I've fallen in love with isekai, specifically, some type of video game based world. Guess it's like a dream of my own. Leadale was a fresh take on things for me, after having seen dozens of others prior. The genre feels a bit stale now, but that's just me. I very much enjoy Leadale, however, left with wanting more. Not in the sense that I fully enjoyed and can't wait for the next season.... rather... there wasn't enough explaining certain aspects of the story that one would expect to be a huge piece to understanding the story. I don't want to give...details and spoil. But I'll say this, great anime overall. Beware, you too, will be left wanting more..."
5-toubun no Hanayome∽,This is a couple episodes that were made as they featured in the manga and didn’t get into the show.I cant really think of a place to put this OVA in chronologically to make much sense as it doesn’t really do anything for the plot of the show so watch it wherever you’d want as long as it’s after the first season and before the final movie and it’ll be fineThat being said it had its normal show vibe and shine which is nice and was enjoyable but only 2 episodes sadly as I wanted more but obviously the show has concluded as...a whole it was good and I’ll gladly take more content from this any day7/10
Make Heroine ga Oosugiru!,"It is yet another overhyped mess. It starts with a premise of ""relationships that go wrong and fail,"" while the whole reality is ""people get turned down before they get into a relationship."" One is not equal to the other.MC is nonexistent, and frankly, if he didn't exist, it would just be a ""drama"" story about young teenage love triangles and crap. Instead he is a narrator of the story, used for puns and to be used by the rest of the cast to feel better about themselves by cracking jokes at his expense. MC is the group pet, who is a bigger loser than...the rest of the cast, as others, by virtue of ""trying,"" feel superior to him in every regard, and he is used for convenience to solve their little problems. And not only that, but he is not growing as a character, not challenging his present self, and not doing anything throughout 8/12 episodes.Literally all of the cast is annoying. They are self-absorbed and self-centered, and all they do is trauma dump their crap on others, which ironically cements the point why someone like them fails in getting into any relationships. It would be one thing to do that with people you actually know, but in reality, MC is not related to any of them at all. They just don't care and continue to do so. ""MC kun, please wait until I go sort crap with my love interest,"" ""MC kun, do me a favor to make me look better,"" ""MC kun, fix my problem that I created."" This for me is an actual definition of hentai. It's perversion, and funny enough, this perversion is somehow viewed in a positive light.Oh. An UNO REVERSE harem! Wow! It really is not. What are you on about? But, hey, I got it. Hot garbage like ""rent a girlfriend"" is popular, so I shouldn't be surprised that this slop gets recognition.There is no romance here, no love, no chemistry.Visually is kind of nice, I guess. A solid 5, it's utter boredom. Not even enough to make me feel irritated about the whole thing."
Mushoku Tensei II: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu Part 2,"I have to give it to the studio—they've done a remarkable job cutting down all the excess garbage from the light novel. However, this has turned the story into a completely bland alternative universe compared to the mess presented in the original. Somehow, even after all that, it still fails to be a coherent story because it remains meaningless. This time, it features a reimagined main character who is just a horny NPC. He does nothing but stand there and react to everything around him, making it seem like he's doing something meaningful—outside of bedding the elf chick.Let's be real. Even the author can't sell...the lie anymore that this story is deep, and die-hard fans can't defend the massive content cuts this season. This series, what it really is: its the most pathetic attempt to turn garbage writing into mainstream success.It's 2024, guys!We all know by now what the author and studio are trying to do here—they’re creating their version of Game of Thrones: Gray moral characters, no clear good or evil, and a bunch of sex scenes thrown in whenever the writer hits a block—at least enough to get the horny crowd to call it peak.But here’s the deal: we already have MF Game of Thrones and way better stories that have sex scenes with actual meaning, weight, and far better writing. Those scenes are smarter, more impactful, and not just pandering to extremely horny teens or people who think sex is a miracle drug to cure depression. Like, what even is this STORY? Get real, guys. GoT premiered in 2011 and this magically gets published a year later in some random site? This is just some Game of thrones ass inster me fan fic LMAOShould be retitled: Reincarnated into Games of Thrones without any of the good writing and got a harem.....Die-hard fans argue that the story is about redemption and that much of the dreck in the light novel was important. Yet the studio has cut most of it out to save this sinking ship for profits. So, was all that dreck necessary? Apparently not, since even the studio doesn’t think so.Simply put, this story was only ever praised by people shouting, “Finally, an MC I can relate to.” when this first was published out. That was the target audience.And honestly, those who argued the story would be better without the predatory aspects of the MC pat yourselves on the back. You are being proven right by the studio cutting it all out. Be happy about that.Anyway, the story this season? A solid 1/10. This isn’t even storytelling—it’s an exercise in baiting the GoT audience with random concepts and ideas that never get explored.Characters? Compared to the obvious source he is ripping of GoT? LMAO. Barely memorable. Even the author doesn’t seem to care about them—they pop in and out of the story without rhyme or reason, except when it’s time for another girl in the harem to fall for the MC. Will he sleep with her? That’s the question, and that’s been the question since Season 1. The mother? Just filler. The real plot is the harem aspect, and die-hard fans know it. That’s why these girls have the most plot armor in a world supposedly filled with danger.For anyone with common sense, I don’t recommend the light novel at all. There are far better isekai out there. This one is the bottom of the barrel, lazy writing at its worst. It’s no surprise so many authors have copied this formula and improved it with minimal effort.I honestly hope Wit does a fantastic job Animating Ascendence of a Bookworm(the real story because whats been animated was nothing but the prologue) because its the only isekai I've seen get awarded for its writing while this one has nothing to offer to the world."
Summertime Render,"Summertime Render, in my opinion, is truly one of the best anime that I have seen. Higurashi is one of my first and the most favorite anime, so it is no surprise that I would absolutely love everything about this show. I decided to go in blind, and the beginning gave me the vibes of a murder mystery and a darker plot that takes place behind the scenes. But then we were introduced to the supernatural aspect of the show and i just knew I had my next favorite anime at my hands. I was hooked right from the first episode and it kept me...invested for every single rest of its episodes. Every single detail, no matter how insignificant just clicks at all the right times. There is so much tension, and so many emotions it evokes and it makes you feel for the characters. Also, the payoff is so so good that you just can't help but feel extremely satisfied.Now, as far the animation aspect of this show is concerned, I got to say, OLM blew it out of the park. They did such an amazing job with this show. The scenes look beautiful with pretty backgrounds that are quite detailed as well. The animation is smooth and fluid and feels like a quality production. Also, the character designs and how they express their emotions has also been amazingly adapted by the studio. This was really such a pleasing anime to watch.This is one of the rare shows that manages to get every single one of its songs right. OP1 and OP 2 are bangers, and ED1 and ED 2 just make me so emotional. They are still in my playlist and constantly listen to this even now. The soundtracks also fit amazingly well with the scenes. The action scenes have good sound effects, and the voice actors have really done a great job.Now, as far as characters go, this show has some of the smartest characters and I don't mean like those unrealistic caricature like characters that have 500000 IQ. No, this feels more realistic and grounded. The actions of our MC Ajiro feels relatable and practical, and it feels like something that I would do in his situation. You just can't help but root for these characters as they are so endearing. Also, each characters have their own distinct unique personality that keeps the interactions fresh and interesting.But hands down, the best part of the show is its story. Wow, this is such a well thought out story that connects all the dots in a satisfying manner by the time it concludes. I was worried when I came to know that the show was going to adapt the entire manga within this season. I was worried they are going to rush it. I was so freaking wrong. The pacing is perfect and it neither drags nor feels rushed. The show keeps the tension throughout all the episodes very efficiently. Also, one often overlooked aspect of this show is the emotional highs this show offers. The inter-personal interactions and dynamics between the characters is also another thing which elevates this show to such a high level. The final episode gives such a satisfying closure to every character in a way that it all just feels worth it and meaningful.In conclusion, I have to say, this is one of the best shows - not just an anime - that I have watched. I loved everything about it and I probably will keep re watching this show every year now as it has become a source of great comfort and enjoyment.10/10"
One Piece,"Before I begin, let me just say that this all my opinion and completely subjective. If you enjoy the show then please ignore this as you will disagree with this.One piece started really good and I will be the first one to admit that. I could sense the vast world building and the brotherhood between the characters this show is going to thrust upon me and not gonna lie, I was hyped AF. It was really good for the first few episodes and was, in my opinion, one of the most enjoyable long running anime. But as time went on, I started to see the...faults in One Piece, and now I just look at it with a sense of disappointment because it has become such a bloated mess that truly has not kept up with the modern anime times. At this point, every arc feels like a modified repetition of the previous arcs.It really starts off as an epic, long adventure anime which pulls you in right at the beginning. The world feels vast and rich, and the character interactions felt wholesome and warm. Initially, each arc feels fresh because of our curiosity to discover the lore of this world, and also because we get invested in the overarching plot of Luffy becoming the Pirate King and finding One Piece. The arcs in the beginning are quite good, and the new villains and new crewmates we were eventually introduced to felt interesting. I personally enjoyed a lot thinking about what Luffy's new bounty would be after each arc.Now, here's where things go down the drain. What happens is that the story stretches the main premise to such an astronomical length that you just can't help but feel exhausted and burnt out. Each successive arc feels like the previous arc with added disguise and makeup. New island, same old sad story and situation at the island, helping new friends from the island, crew starts their respective fights, same old overused emotional backstories, new gomu gomu which helps Luffy win barely. The whole thing kind of starts feeling cheap.If this sounds bad, wait till you hear how worse it gets after a certain time-skip. The story repeats upon itself so many times that you just cannot for the love of god feel any excitement at what you are watching. The novelty wore off quick at least in my case. Entire arcs were stretched so much that you cannot even sense any form of a meaningful progression in the plot. Also, needless to say, the stakes - both physical and emotional - feel superficial and fake. Same old tropes and methods of trying to evoke an artificial reaction or emotions from the viewers. Also, no character development, in my humble opinion. Usopp, who we once rooted for, became a comedian. Sanji is still a simp with no growing up in sight for him, Zoro is either fighting or setting up his overused gag of being unable to find the way.The world felt huge and interesting in the beginning. Now it feels boring and less creative and just plain predictable. Also, the author kind of forgot to keep the 'One Piece' aspect of the show relevant by at least throwing in some small arcs or plot points and giving us a few substantial crumbs dedicated exclusively about it. But all we get is some insignificant, random teasing with no concrete development to shape what One Piece might be. Kind of frustrating, personally speaking. At this point, the journey has become so boring that I don't care anymore. I will just read up what One Piece is when it gets revealed in the manga.My conclusion is that, the journey was definitely not worth. I tried getting into manga as well which I was not a big fan of either. I guess that was because the anime left such a sour taste in my mouth. But oh well! There are so many better, shorter, more enjoyable shows out there. I would rather watch the one piece remake by WIT studio which I just know is going to exponentially superior than this slug fest. It might take ages but its fine, I would rather spend my time watching other better shows in the meantime.4/10"
Kaze no Tani no Nausicaä,"A Timeless Masterpiece: Nausicaä of the Valley of the WindStudio Ghibli’s Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind is not merely an animated film; it’s an emotional odyssey that challenges viewers to think deeply about humanity’s relationship with nature, technology, and themselves. Directed by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki, this 1984 classic stands as a towering achievement in animation and storytelling, paving the way for the creation of Studio Ghibli itself.The story unfolds in a post-apocalyptic world, where toxic jungles and gargantuan insects dominate the landscape, threatening the survival of humanity. At the heart of the narrative is Nausicaä, the princess of the peaceful Valley of...the Wind. A heroine like no other, Nausicaä is courageous, empathetic, and deeply connected to the natural world. Her unwavering determination to heal the rift between humans and nature is both inspiring and poignant.Visually, Nausicaä is breathtaking. Every frame is a work of art, from the sweeping vistas of the toxic jungle to the intricate designs of the Ohmu, the massive, otherworldly insects that embody the mysterious beauty of Miyazaki’s imagination. The animation is fluid and expressive, capturing the delicate balance between fragility and power that defines the film’s aesthetic.The soundtrack, composed by Joe Hisaishi, elevates the film to celestial heights. The music is hauntingly beautiful, blending ethereal melodies with moments of intense emotion. It weaves seamlessly with the visuals, creating a sensory experience that lingers long after the credits roll.What sets Nausicaä apart is its profound message. It’s a cautionary tale about environmental degradation and the consequences of human arrogance. Yet, it is also a story of hope, emphasizing the power of compassion and coexistence. Nausicaä herself embodies these ideals, becoming a beacon of light in a world shrouded in despair.This film is more than an anime—it’s a philosophical exploration of humanity’s future and a call to action. Its themes remain as relevant today as they were when it first graced the silver screen, making it a timeless work of art.For fans of animation, environmental storytelling, or simply extraordinary cinema, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind is an absolute must-watch. It’s a film that doesn’t just entertain—it enlightens, leaving viewers with a renewed sense of wonder and responsibility for the world around them.Studio Ghibli’s debut feature is, without question, one of the greatest animated films ever made. Nausicaä’s story continues to inspire audiences worldwide, reminding us of the profound impact one person can have when driven by love and hope."
Dandadan,"This anime surprised me in the most unique way.The voice acting, adaptation is all praise worthy.Initially while watching the first few episodes I really thought just another anime which is going to fall off, however I was wrong. This anime really gives you all from very cool fighting scenes to character development as well as its laidback humor. Even the fan service isn't that obvious like in some other anime like ""fire force"" which ultimately gives you the ick and drives you away from the plot. Overall I would say that this is a must watch anime for fall season 2024. The alternate switching between...aliens having ulterior motives and just traditional old ghosts is fabulous."
.hack//Sign,"Misunderstood masterpiece from the golden age of anime, its slow & story/dialogue heavy with deep character interaction which i found very satisfying & chilled, the art style?? well the art style is typical for the era its was created with warm thick grainy saturated colors which in my opinion makes it very distinct as opposed to the washed out thin looking art style you will see in current day modern anime shows ..  but with this type of anime you go with vibe & atmosphere..a unique gem & experience made in a more prolific prominent optimistic era of anime before a time of memes...& internet weeb culture, dont expect sword art online levels of flashy action, it is a journey, a journey of self discovery & sorrowful reflection that happens to take place in a mmorpg world, u have to be ""in the mood"" or ""mentally prepared"" but in the end its one of the most compelling charming mature mystery adventures iv ever seen in my life.p.s  the music & sound design is haunting & sublimepeace out."
Banana Fish,"Banana Fish is one of the greatest anime that I have ever watched.Something about this anime is special to me. It shouldn't really interest me. Sure, I watched Cowboy Bebop years ago and enjoyed it, but I've never really been able to find myself getting so invested in the story of an action anime, hell, action in any form of media, as I got with Banana Fish. Watching it felt like a drug, I could not stop.The anime itself seems like the embodiment of its main character: violent, beautiful, dramatic and yet so cold at times. It puts up a façade; from the outside in...the show seems to be a fun shonen, not all too introspective and a delight to watch. The viewer will get satisfied by the violence and the eventual outcome of the story. Sure, this show too has epic scenes of gunfights, fistfights and the like, but Banana Fish is so much more than just that. The emotion in this anime is, to my knowledge, unrivaled in this genre of anime (yes, I know it's a shoujo, but I'm talking about regular action anime here). Banana Fish covers a lot of heavy themes like rape, especially with children. The creators seem to have a perfect knowledge of when to deal a blow to your mood, as in some scenes you're heartstrings will be pulled like marionettes. It creates suspense, sadness and pure joy out of thin air, and all that for some animated fictional people as well.The show's main focus is the relationship between the two main characters, Ash and Eiji. Despite them being polar opposites, they fill each other in perfectly. They both benefit from each other, but are also their biggest weakness. From gang conflicts to governmental corruption, Eiji's inexperience often gets them in trouble, causing Ash to save the day.Which leads me to the one single problem I have with this anime. It's what my old English teacher would have called 'hardware': some parts of the anime feel so forced and predictable. In the lead up to the grand finale (this lead up starts right after the exposition, mind you!) we slowly start learning more and more about the overarching story. In 24 episodes, the creators have created a story that could easily be resolved in 5. Sure, some character development by the MC's would be missing, but the story itself would still be fully intact. Episodes where one character gets taken away and nearly dies, but is saved in some miraculous way occur more than acceptable. Some forced suspense is fine, but sometimes it just seems like the original manga had too little material for the animators to use. (Now, I haven't read the manga, so I don't know how much the two are alike, but it gives off the impression that they had to stuff up the story a little in order to reach 24 episodes.My critique is short, because apart from it, there is nothing bad to remark about this anime. I cannot put my appreciation of this show to words, so please watch it for yourself. I ended up giving it a 9/10, as it is great but suffers from one issue."
Dandadan,"A Masterpiece.10/10 in all regards. Animation, Story, Art, Music, Sound effects. It's a masterclass in Action Comedy.It is what you should think of when you mention the word ""Anime"". With both amazing art, Great Story, Great Characters, and Humor to package it all up.Every episode i watch i let out an audible ""Hahahahaha ROFLmao."" and it does an amazing job at that! But also keeps my jaw detached with wonder, as to how a show like this has better animation, framing and art then almost any other show right now. With the premise that it's running with.It's definitely a telling show, if you watch it...and at-least like it, you should continue down the path of Anime, and if you don't, you should probably stop watching anime, as this has always been prevalent and ecchi is one of the biggest recurring things, even in shows not labeled as such.Not just a story for Alien/ Ghost Lovers. The action and everything about this screams ""peak Shonen"" So any fans of demon slayer, Sword Art Online, or twilight: Breaking Dawn pt. 2 would definitely have a good time.Watch it!"
Ao no Hako,"In the barrage of seasonal anime, this one felt like a break from all the stress in just a wholesome, classic, and well-written romance anime. This anime carries out the tropes of sports anime and romance anime perfectly in a blend that is entertaining and very fun to watchEnjoyment 10/10  having such a fun time watching this anime. I look forward to ever Thursday for Dandadan and Blue Box it just makes you smile without fail.Art 9/10I like this art style a-lot it's not perfect but I think that's part of the fun.Story 9/10The story is great, sometime they have overuse of tropes...that can get slightly tiring but it's really goodCharacters 9/10The character are great, I love their character designs. But they don't have the most complex goals or personalities.Overall:Watch it for sure, it's super fun and great all around!P.S sorry if it's too short I'm in a rush"
Under Ninja,"Ninja and perversion go hand in handThe action is some real crazy ninja stuff.  humor is so perverted that it's hard not to have a smile on your face.But the characters are so quirky that Dynamics just never get boring. How the most insane stuff happened, but they are so deadpan about it, it makes it so funny.The character design feels like caricature of real Japanese people, it looks really distinct and rough, but in the best way.the main character is fun to watch, I never really get tired of the tired main character, that doesn't really want to do anything but lay around...but is forced to do so much. It's just one of the main character type that I never get tired of.The anime is so horny and it used so well in the jokes. it's surprising how much of the plot horniness is involved.Interesting fun corporate backstepping in highest caliber.  fun anime but one that has that eternal problem that it's not a finished story it has an Ending but I want a conclusion, so yeah read the manga ending."
Eiyuu Gaiden Mozaicka,"Eiyuu Gaiden Mozaicka is a thoroughly classic example of the standalone 90s OVA- It's a sci-fi/fantasy adventure romp that's only a few episodes long and manages to be both extremely unique and doggedly formulaic at the same time. This characteristic is omnipresent throughout the anime, and especially its setting, so as such we'll begin this analysis with the story that forms the foundation of the work. Its worldbuilding is immediately representative of this dualism, in that it feels like an extremely classic sword and sorcery type hero's journey, complete with heroic knights and warrior women in skimpy armor and ancient prophecies, while on the other...hand it's bizarrely syncretic with science fiction, with bad guys flying spaceships around the planet, weird energy weapons, and ""castles"" that look like distorted air traffic control towers. So, in this way, it is both utterly formulaic and utterly unique. If I had to make a distinction as to how it can maintain both identities at the same time, I'd say it comes down to the fact that the story is formulaic but the setting is unique. That's not to say the story is bad, just predictable, and the strange, otherworldly setting certainly pulls its weight in terms of keeping the viewer on their toes.This brings me to the art, which exhibits this same inner conflict. Once again, the setting is very weird, and this anime reminds you at every moment that there are equal parts evil sorcerers to giant automatons to be dealt with. On the other hand, the way that its executed feels very old school, almost more like an 80s or even late 70s anime than a 90s one, with plenty of background detail but a somewhat limited range of animation, which itself is guilty of clumsy stage-fight style action sequences and limited character detail, often having a particular issue with illustrating and animating faces.The sound is more cut and dry, meeting all basic standards of quality for the time, even if some of the voice work is rather hammy and amateurish.The characters leave little to say about them, as they're all fairly generic executions of various tropes. Of the cast, U-Taruma and Moruka are the best characters, U-Taruma for being a completely unoriginal yet nonetheless cool execution of the selfless heroic warrior archetype, and Moruka for being a boisterous, alcoholic Chewbacca stand-in. The two of them together again embody this OVA's central theme by one being completely unoriginal and the other being a unique, bizarre inclusion in the story. Overall, Eiyuu Gaiden Mozaicka is an odd little OVA, and while it's not necessarily good or bad, it's still on the whole a generally entertaining way to spend a couple hours, especially if you like old OVAs. If that era's not your style, then you definitely wouldn't enjoy this anime, as the experience essentially consists of that time's distilled cultural essence from start to finish."
Sousou no Frieren,"do not watch this knowing that it is ranked #1 on myanimelist.. it truly do not deserve that spot. The animation is mid-tier (and worst than blue lock sometimes), some characters are good nowadays, but teh fact that the only philosophical asopect of te anilme is ""oh i am immortel, i should learn to take cares of others and oh yeah 100 years is not a long time""... and thats it.. such a disapointement !!! and the music.. mid tiers too. i cant understand how people can love it that much !! and if you already saw To you eternity, do not watch it. trust...me."
Lv2 kara Cheat datta Motoyuusha Kouho no Mattari Isekai Life,"Lv2 kara Cheat is okayish... The reason I still went for the recommended review instead of mixed feelings is because I think it's enjoyable for people who already like and enjoy watching isekais. If you've never watched one, you probably shouldn't start with this one, and I'll try to explain briefly why down below.This anime is clearly aiming for the average, and it will check many boxes of the isekai genre : op mc, pseudo harem, basic plot, average animation quality etc... And while a few elements are done right such as the number of characters introduced, the female MC, the opening song, the...slice of life vibe and the development of their home/everyday life, there are also many elements done wrong. Indeed, the plot is forgettable, the rhythm is fine for the first half but it becomes too slow afterwards, and it highlights another problem : there aren't any real stakes in this anime, and it would be fine with different settings, but here, the plot involves a global war between demons & humans, so the end result is a bit weird, why should the viewers care about the plot if even the characters don't really care for it ?Now to be fair, the anime doesn't take itself seriously, so it's easy to forgive the show for its absence of stakes, but the fact remains that the rhythm feels off after a few episodes and it becomes a bit boring at times.All in all, this show is a typical isekai, it will please people who enjoy this genre and it will annoy people who don't. The anime does manage to establish a cozy light hearted vibe and it's interesting to see the characters evolve in their everyday life. However, the absence of stakes hurts the show and its rhythm, in the end, there's not much happening in the span of 12 episodes and people who aren't used to fantasy isekai animes might feel confused because the last episodes are really underwhelming. I liked Lv2 kara Cheat for what it had to offer but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, and there are many better isekais to watch beforehand."
"""Oshi no Ko""","Alright... so Oshi no Ko Season 1? I’d give it a solid 8/10. The story is super engaging, especially that first episode—it felt like a full-on movie with how much it packed in emotionally. The way it blends drama, mystery, and a critique of the entertainment industry is just 😊👍The animation is clean, and you can tell Doga Kobo really brought their A-game... Aqua and Ruby’s journeys are both really interesting, though Aqua’s whole revenge thing can feel a bit much at times... And the way they show the darker side of fame? Hits way harder than I expectedThat said... it does slow down a...little here and there, and I wish some side characters got more time to develop. But overall, it’s a binge-worthy show if you’re into deep, emotional storytelling with some pretty intense twists... Definitely worth the watch!"
Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari Season 3,"Already from the first episode, I could tell I would enjoy this a lot more than I did the second season. And I liked the second season just fine, gave it a 5 for my ratings. But I actually felt a bit of excitement when watching season 3, something I felt in the first season but not the second. I was more interested and invested in the plot too, similar to the first season once more.Also, might I say I love both the opening and the ending of season 3? Because I do. I loved the ending of the first season and liked the opening...as well. But the second season was a downgrade for me in everything. But in the third season, I think they made up for it. The opening is spectacular since I adore the animation style. The ending is not anything amazing, but I love the style they went with, so I love it. (FYI; When it comes to opening and ending, my focus is on the visual more than the actual song).I'm not one to think 'too little too late' when it comes to shows. If I like it, I like it. There is no point holding grudges for a lackluster season.Besides, to me, it seems like they took the criticism from season 2(or maybe understood it would only hurt their reputation/pocket if they tried season 2 style again) and did season 3 justice. There were some amazing, stunning, and beautiful moments of animation too. I have seen that animation style before in another show -as well as in the opening- and would be happy to see it again. it's just stunning.I do think the season could use more episodes to delve into the charecters and plot more since some moments of character and plot points did feel a tiny bit rushed. This was the season with the least episodes in it after all. But it's not too bad, and it did feel more like they did the best with what they had rather than whatever happened in season 2 where it felt more like a money-grab effort after the success of season 1. I don't mind money grabs as long as it does not feel like one.Season 3 felt like animators were allowed to put some special care and effort into it, something I felt lacking in Season 2 (Season 2 had some moments, but it just did not stand up to the standard season one set in any way). And if season 2 was the 'setup' season, I was satisfied with the result that came from it in season 3. But season 3 does not have a satisfying ending. Keep in mind that season 3 is also more of a lead-up to season 4. I think it has been confirmed a season 4 is coming, but not too sure.So to summarize: I honestly think it's sad to see the recommended/not recommended being so 50/50 here. Season 3 deserves better I say.Season 2, while not great, was alright.  I personally think season 3 was close to the first season(but it does lack some parts I hope will be filled with season 4) based solely on my own personal enjoyment. That is my honest opinion. So I think if you liked the first season and want more, getting to season 3 is worth it. But it will not give you a satisfying end, just a lead-up to the next season.So far the seasons might work better as one show rather than season by season when it comes to rating, so I am looking forward to seeing how it all will end."
Make Heroine ga Oosugiru!,"The show starts and goes along the lines of breakups and rejections and you’d think this way you’d expect the 2 MCs getting together developing feelings and being a thing by the end of it.HOWEVER it doesn’t. Kinda.. it shows the characters and their friends in the literature club getting along. And being friends so it does do that, but it doesn’t give the romantic side of it. There is a little bit of it, but there’s not enough to make it a proper generic romance anime.That being said the development is there and in the future, I could see it being a thing...but this season not so much with that being said though I did enjoy the show and I would like a season two7/10"
"Komi-san wa, Comyushou desu.","This is like a power fantasy but in a romance anime. Komi is beautiful, athletic, smart, perfect, etc. but she is shy and doesn't talk to others. Conveniently she has a crush on our very average main character. Isn't this a bit too self serving? They shoved the ""perfection"" trait on a girl and made her dependent on the MC and conveniently also in love with him. Why do people enjoy this? Do they try to insert themselves instead of the MC, fantasizing about having a perfect girl crush on them?There isn't really a good story to be found here. Hell, there aren't good interactions...to be found here because Komi being ""shy"" is her top-defining trait. I hate shy characters with a passion. They are always predictably boring. If you ask them if they wanna play videogames, they will act shy. If you ask them if they wanna eat lunch together, they will be shy. If their name gets called, you guessed it, they will act shy. A shy character does only one thing without fail, try to end any interaction because they are shy.There isn't really an attempt to do anything here except ""le Komi makes cute face"" or ""le Komi has cat ears and its cute"". Before fantasizing about perfect girls being dependent on you and in love with you, fantasize about touching some grass please. This is boring."
Sentai Daishikkaku,"“Go! Go! Loser Ranger!” is what happens when a pretty good idea is held down by a terrible mismatched mix of genres.I’m a sucker for genre deconstructions. My favourite story of this type, and in general, is “Miracleman” by Alan Moore. Needless to say that when I read the synopsis for “Go! Go! Loser Ranger!” I was hyped. I thought it would be a Super Sentai deconstruction in a similar way that “The Watchmen” (also by Alan Moore) or “The Boys” were a deconstruction of Marvel and DC superheroes and… to a degree it is. It has some elements of a competent deconstruction but is...held back by terrible comedy timing and the absurd world it takes place in. Does that make it a bad anime? I don’t think so. It does however make it less than competent deconstruction. I warn You to keep that in mind if You are also a fan of deconstructions. Thing is that episode 2 and 3 work as a solid prologue to an amazing deconstruction and are even played as such. Episode 1 is another beast but I’ll get to that.Before we start I would like to explain something. I will be talking about “plot” and “story”. Many people use those terms interchangeably. I’m not one of those people, so to make sure everyone is on the same page…I use the definitions for “plot” and “story” as Lisa Cron describes them:“What happens in the story is the PLOT, the surface events.”“STORY is about how the things that happen affect someone in pursuit of a difficult goal, and how that person changes internally as a result”.I’m not gonna lie, I like the story. A story about a frustrated, basically slave, that decides to fuck over his tormentors. It’s a cool idea, not a very original one but a cool one. A bonus is that no one in this show has a moral high ground. Everyone is an asshole in one way or another, a sociopath or has less than righteous motives and plans. The MC (Fighter D) is literally a creature created to fight, kill and conquer humanity. He even has a goal to take over the world and be top dog. The drawback to this approach is that there isn’t really anyone to root for. On one side we have psycho rangers, on the other a power hungry idiot. I really couldn't care less about any of them if I tried. Maybe I would feel differently if Fighter D was a man with a plan but the truth is he doesn’t think things through (apart from 3 situations in later episodes) and wings it most of the time. He has a goal. Cool. But has no plan of achieving it.When it comes to the plot… I’m not a fan of the first half. For the first 5 (and a lot of 6) episodes it’s like the plot can’t decide what it wants to be. There are even moments when Fighter D (I refuse to call him just D. D is an awesome and competent vampire hunter not a poorly written moron. He’s Fighter D of FD from now on) is relegated to the role of deuteragonist, something that should never happen in an anime that has only 12 episodes.I will give credit where credit is due, there is a lot of “because of that” type of storytelling here. The problem is that the main beats that are the catalysts of this are mostly the effect of “and then that happened” type of storytelling. In this case it’s not as bad as in some other anime, apart from episode 2, that shit is just bullshit, but it still stands out.It had so much potential as a hero deconstruction and yet it decided to squander that potential for cheap jokes that kill any sort of drama, inconsistent protagonist and a world full of idiots. Granted, if the world had more than a bunch of people with an IQ higher than room temperature this whole show wouldn’t have happened in the way it does. But that’s the curse of anime in the last 15 years… oh well, c'est la vie.The first episode actually fulfills its function pretty well. It gives us a brief look at both sides of the greater conflict and does some lifting in worldbuilding without being a straight up exposition dump like some other anime do. Don’t get Your hopes up too much, there is still exposition.It shows us that the Keepers are machiavellian assholes, the fighters are cowardly peons without any sort of long term plan or even a goal. It also shows us that the world is populated by idiots. It has been 13 years since the invaders came to conquer earth. 13 years. In this time the conflicts were transformed from actual war-like skirmishes into a weekly spectacle. It was also 12 years since the last human died due to a monster attack and no one asks questions about this? I may be autistic but I would assume that if something life threatening suddenly turners into entertainment for the masses there would be questions. After 13 years even “The Simpsons” lost some of its viewership. Everyone just accepts that a force that was hell bent on world domination just attacks now in regular intervals, always in the same place, always with just a small unit and a boss, and only attacks the Keepers. There are shit loads of civilians with only a mere squad of security. If there were more of them they could paint the damn stadium red. Yes they do have an arrangement with the keepers but it’s stated that most people don’t know about it. Yet they still come to a place that would have no business being as safe for them as it is, if this was still a real conflict. I can’t even feel sorry for them. If they die, that’s on them. Natural selection wins.Listen, if I were to only look at its function I would probably give this episode something like 5 or maybe, MAYBE 6. But alas I’m the type of guy that cares more about the plot and story than just function. There is very little logic and believability in this world. How can I take the drama seriously if the whole world is packed full of nonsense and idiots?Let’s talk about the moment of the enslave… I mean, the arrangement the Keepers made with dusters. The deal was made 12 years earlier. 12 years. Let that sink in. The Keepers look as if they were in their mid 20's. Let’s say they are 25 (I have no idea if their age is stated anywhere so I might be wrong). 13 years ago when the conflict started they would be around 12-13. So now we have a couple of  ways of looking at it. Either this is a different team than the one who made the dead, which isn’t very probable since they look and sound the same. Red even has the same mannerisms as he does in the present. Second. The transformations aged them when they were kids. Which is dumb but was made in “Power Rangers Turbo” with Justin Stewart so I wouldn’t be that much surprised. There is also a third option. The Keepers are in their mid to late 30s. Which is even worse because it implies that grown-ass men (and one woman) in their 30s act like spoiled kids. Furthermore, being in their 30’s isn’t old (I’m gonna tell myself that since I’m at the tail end of my 30’s) but it’s past their prime. They have a whole production line of Keepers and yet, not one Ranger in their 20s was able to outdo someone with their 30s? I could believe this in the case of Red, he does seem to have some unnatural level of strength almost like he spends every Dark Souls game using Strength builds, but the rest? I find it hard to believe the Keepers don’t have early retirements if only to keep the illusion of them being all powerful alive. Also, in Your 30s You tend to change Your outlook on life and what You value in it. Yet all of the Keepers are still acting like spoiled children. Mostly Red but Blue is also cocky and pays for it.Let’s get to the second part of the show. From around episode 7 (maybe 6 but that’s me being nice) the show changes. It becomes more focused. Almost like the writer took some writing classes when no one was looking. It gets better and worse at the same time. It becomes worse because it mostly loses its unique pitch. Yes we’re still in the universe where Power Rangers are psychos, yes most people are still morons and our MC still has a revenge boner but the show stops throwing garbage jokes anytime something serious happens (still does, but not so much so I count that as a win). The drawback is that it becomes just another tournament / exam regurgitated garbage You see in every school anime these days. It became so basic that I couldn’t even tell You why the exam was so dumb. Granted I’m not sure even the people writing this could tell You that but that’s beside the point.The infiltration and fucking up an organization from the inside is a good idea. Not many anime and even movies do that. But there is a reason why. It’s really tough to write something like that in a way that doesn’t feel cheap. The best example I can think of, of this type of plot is “Infernal Affair” - an amazing movie that uses an undercover cop and an undercover mob member to create suspense and drama. It’s a masterpiece of writing. The thing is, there are 3 movies in the series and only the first one is amazing. It’s that hard to write this sort of plot. It would be hard enough in a realistic setting, adding a Super Sentai fantasy to it makes it even more so, and adding dumb jokes that don’t land ruins it almost entirely. Probably why, the jokes stop at some point and the show gets better because of it.The exam arc also shows us another part of FD. His thinking and strategic part. Seriously, the second half of the show proves that he can think strategically and on the fly. Why isn’t this mofo the leader? The way he fools the opposing team to get the key, the way he takes charge of the situation when shit hits the fan and the way he plans the fight during the exam are really solid writing.. With few crappy moments but compared to the rest of the show it’s top notch. For 12 years he didn’t think of leading his own kind? With this kind of adaptability he could become a real threat to the world. So why just now? Oh, right… the plot demands it.The only thing I would call bullshit is that at some point he reveals his identity to convince someone to join his “cause”. It’s dumb and totally unnecessary. He could have convinced him in so many ways that I would spend a day and a half naming them. Ok, the reveal could have been the final method but the dumb ass barely tried anything else.Ok… this is getting too long for any sane person to read and I’m not even ¾ of the way I wanted on a list of things I wanted to address so…At the end of the day I don’t think this is a bad anime. The animation and art style are nice and OST is pretty solid as well. My main grype is that it is positioned as a deconstruction and I guess it does have elements of it, but it’s not a very good one. Shame because the idea has potential and I would lie if I told You I did not enjoy the second half of it."
Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso,"Your Lie in April is nothing short of a masterpiece, and I totally understand why this series is so beloved.Art:The art didn’t really speak to me personally, but it was consistent throughout and didn’t have any weak moments. I found the use of colour to be a nice touch. I also loved how the piano was animated—the detailed shots of the inside parts were fascinating, and I’m guessing the hand movements were accurate too, though I’m no expert.Music:I’m not a musician, so I can’t say what makes one pianist better than another. But the piano music in this anime felt like it truly spoke to...me. Despite my lack of musical knowledge, I could feel what the pieces were trying to convey (though that is probably to be expected from an anime with such a heavy focus on music...).Characters:One of the things I really appreciated was how the story didn’t just focus on the two main characters. Most of the cast felt like they mattered, and I’m glad they got the attention they deserved. There were just enough characters to keep things interesting without making anyone feel forgettable.Story:The story was fantastic. The pacing was great, and I have to admit, this show had me losing sleep. I’m not someone who usually binges a series in just a few days, but the pianist in the blue suit had that something that kept me hooked.Despite my high praise, I'd like to adress a few negatives as well:Though I just praised the development that most of the characters received, I felt like Tsubaki didn’t get the proper conclusion she deserved. It felt like she was just kind of tossed aside with a shrug, like, “Eh, she’ll be fine.”I also wasn’t a big fan of the “violence = funny” scenes, which were surprisingly common. Sure, it might have worked once or twice, but it felt way overused. You have this perfectly bittersweet story on your hands—why stain it with goofy, out-of-place moments that don’t fit the tone?Still, these criticisms aren’t enough to lower my rating. I’d give this series a perfect 10/10.Thank you, Maty, for the recommendation—I had an amazing time watching it."
Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei,"This anime had potential, and I can see why some people might enjoy it, but it didn’t work for me.The MC is actually well-written—he’s not perfect, but he’s compelling and has depth without being a flat, overpowered character. That said, the ""joking"" sibling romance subplot, driven by the sister, is straight-up gross and awkward to sit through. It’s not funny, it’s not charming, and it actively drags down the experience.The pacing is another big problem. It’s already slow for something billed as an action sci-fi, with not nearly enough actual action, and those uncomfortable ""rom-com"" scenes only make it worse.I usually enjoy detailed explanations in...anime, and I don’t mind when a show takes its time to explain its world. But here, the dialogue is unnecessarily convoluted, throwing in overly complex explanations for no reason—especially since it doesn’t provide enough background to make sense of them. This makes it hard to follow and nearly impossible to speed-watch while still being too dull for normal speed.It’s frustrating because there’s a decent foundation here, but the execution just misses the mark."
Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari Season 2,"It does not stand up to the first season, and I did not connect with the characters as much as I did the first season. The new characters were likable, but I wish we had more time with them. But it wasn't awful or anything. I found mild enjoyment while watching it, and the animation was about the same level with some moments that were great and consistent, and some(mainly the 3D animation) being just alright. Nothing too jarring.Basically, it was fun seeing the characters I already liked interacting with new characters and in new environments. And there were decent character developments as well. The...second season was a bit lackluster, but it was not bad."
Make Heroine ga Oosugiru!,"I'm glad I didn't pass this up.This is definitely a romance anime, but its unique twist gives it a very distinguished flavor. Prepare yourself for the cringe and the broken hearts that comes with some (as the title suggests), but also the strong bonds that will forge. The excellent writing that comes with this makes the show feel fresh, engaging and hilarious as the comedy in this show is also one of its strong suits.Another great thing this anime has is that it's simply beautiful to watch. I've rewound some scenes just to watch it over again simply because it was so fascinating to look...at. To understand what I mean, go watch the first 5 minutes of the first episode yourself.The characters have clear, distinct and interesting personalities with relatable difficulties that they try to overcome. The chemistry between our main characters feel real and they work surprisingly well together despite their insanely opposite hobbies and interests. I would also add that supporting or background characters don't look like your average Joe either, they fit great into the atmosphere of this world and not bland and ignorable.Overall, I had a very enjoyable experience with this and would honestly consider watching it again in the near future.(Chika is best girl)"
Jiu Chen Fengyun Lu,"Its ok. For a progression fantasy series its pretty standard stuff and the plot is similar to a lot of manhua I've read. The pacing is lightning fast, this first arc takes place over about 4 months. A lot of things are not explained, like when the mc is suddenly able to ride a sword despite never learning (or mentioned learning) before. He uses mythical tools to save the people around him, despite being a novice cultivator. So it doesn't really seem like the mc earned all the power he has by the end of the season. Also the women in the series are clearly...archetypes that only ever have conversations with the mc, they don't have unique personalities. The writing is... not good and the characters are bland happy go lucky heroes (or villains bent on revenge).I do think this style of 3D animation has gotten better over the last few years. The faces of different characters are more recognizable, and the expressions are clearer. Also the textures of the clothing are fun to see. The poses and movements are still awkward but its like that for this whole subgenre.TLDR its watchable but there are better ways to spend 5 hours of your time."
Yao Shen Ji 2nd Season,"I like the plot, at least partly, but the CGI is absolutely terrible—feels like watching a cheap video game. It would have looked so much better in 2D animation. Honestly, I’m just watching it to finish the series at this point. The excessive ""fan service"" makes it even harder to sit through, as it feels forced and distracting. Overall, I can’t find many redeeming qualities in this; it’s been a pretty underwhelming watch.I like the plot, at least partly, but the CGI is absolutely terrible—feels like watching a cheap video game.

The enemies, too, come across as childish and lack depth, which makes it hard to take them seriously. I’m watching it in translation, and it’s packed with references to Naruto—which, to be honest, was more annoying than nostalgic. It just feels like it’s trying too hard to ride on the coattails of a better series, rather than standing on its own."
Kimi ni Todoke,"I'm watching this show for the first time because it comes highly rated by Shoujo aficionados and I'm at episode 14 of season 1. I had to stop. I had to Google if anyone else found this show as insufferable as I do. I'm typically a sucker for a good romance and I don't even mind the oblivious, socially inept stereotype so many of these kinds of stories feature. Miyamura from Horimiya is likeable, because, first of all, he isn't stupid and secondly, he has agency. He stands up for himself.Kimi Ni Todoke takes social awareness a level or fifty too far. Sawako is simply...not a likeable character. I get that she's supposed to be and that her innocence is supposed to be endearing, but she doesn't work as a character because her flaws go far beyond just social awkwardness. She lacks a number of very basic human traits, like a complete inability to get angry or offended, regardless of how unfairly she's being treated. In fact, she lacks even the ability to understand when she's being treated unfairly - something most humans learn to understand while we're still toddlers.Any good story depends on its ability to suspend the disbelief of its audience. But Sawako is not a believable character. Even 14 episodes in, she still gets flustered and red faced when people who have been friendly with her for the past 10 episodes are still friendly toward her. She keeps stuttering and blushing around Kazehaya, regardless of how much time they've spent together. She keeps seeing the best in everyone, regardless of how badly they treat her. She never, ever stands up for herself. She's like someone who fell from the Moon without ever having interacted with humans before.It's not that I expect anime characters to be 100% realistic, but any good fictional character must be relatable in some way for us to bother. Sawako fails the test. While most of us can relate to social awkwardness, few of us can relate to being so utterly estranged from the most fundamental social cues that a small tree dwelling gibbon could outwit them. And since she's the focal point around which all the other characters act and develop, they too become unbelievable through their interactions with her. And since the entire story is predicated upon misunderstandings based in the above mentioned unbelievable social defects, it falls apart at the seams because it fails to suspend disbelief.I barely managed to sit through 14 episodes of this. There's lots of good anime out there that manages to tell a coherent and compelling story, complete with full character arcs and satisfying conclusions, in just 12 episodes. I'm less than halfway through season 1. And I've read that season 2 is even worse.I'm dropping it. Sawako defeated me through sheer annoyance."
Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 2nd Season Part 2,"So I haven't finished the last episode still a few minutes left but overall, I lost interest in this series. I didn't want to drop the last few episodes so I forced myself to watch it, no disrespect to fans of the series. Not one of the best for the series. I have no interest in watching the 3rd season, maybe I will pick it up after a few months but yea this was a hard watch for me.The story got predictable after 5 episodes, if your like me then you might not enjoy it but to each their own.Character development: 6/10Story: 6/10Animation: 6/10Enjoyment: 5/10Overall:...7/10"
Uzumaki,"Uzumaki an adaptation of the same name from one of the works of juni ito now on the big screen that has been on production for quite a while with a couple of delays in between with the promise of deliver something of quality that was on pair to the original source which..... sadly at the end wasnt the case past the first episode.Animation suffers a HUGE downfall past the first episode even there were a couple of questionable moments that foreshadows what it comes on the next ones with really noticeable poor animated secuences that in each episode gradually starts getting worse,  with...just a total of 4 episodes and given the amount of time under production the series doesn't hold an at least decent quality speaking animation wise which in comparision with others like ""Sousou no Frieren"" with a format much longer feels like night and day on this aspect.The sequences sometimes feels kinda off and the general writting on this is not great which gives me the impression that is not the forte per say of my guy junji ito, on one moment we have these two chicks fighting with their possesed hair and just a couple of seconds after that the series just keeps moving on with this snail kid without connecting both events well and the little information that we have to know what was about some of these characters later on are one scene of some seconds that happen in the background, in general feels like a bunch of differents stories that besides of happening on the same town have little to nothing to do one with the other.Though worth to mention that the overall scheme of the main plot is in general terms quite interesting and the way how it ends is also to say the least good.Beyond all that uzumaki with the main plot of those strange events taking place, the genius decision of making the series black and white, the impeccable selection of spooky tracks that stablish the atmosphere freaking well the entirety of the series and the fact that is one of the few IF not the only anime series that touches an weird genre like the horror on this media (which is somthing we dont use to get almost never) in a manner quite pleasing makes it hard for me to not reccomend it to watch at least once despite all the bad things aforementioned, only for the originality and freshness that has in constrast with the generic and cclasic isekais that seems to be the norm for each season it enough reason to give it a chance."
Fate/stay night Movie: Heaven's Feel - III. Spring Song,"All good stories come to an end,either you are ready or not. I for one binged all 3 movies in one sitting . The experience is... something i haven't felt ever since i was excited watching my first anime when i was smaller. Nowadays mediocrity is the norm all across the board. No risk taking, just safe apologetic slop. I for one hate it. That's why im all in for this true masterpiece. Once again, they go big and hit the bullseye with this one. The animation, the sound that also adds more then people even realize.Now that it's over though... i feel rather empty.......I know for a fact however that one point I WILL rewatch this series and everything fate has to offer. The one small gripe is the ending's kinda not explained, had to look for answers elsewhere.10/10. You won't regret it, unless you started watching it with the feeling that you need to dislike it for whatever reason."
Fate/stay night Movie: Heaven's Feel - I. Presage Flower,"Seems i am proven right again by the masses that i should form my own opinion by watching it myself,as im shocked by the quite low score of this movie compared to the quality. And so should you really.As for a more objective opinion, i slugged through even the biggest slops anime has to offer, im proud to say i've only dropped 1 anime to date, and my portofolio is way bigger then what i registered on this site. One hand is more then enough to count the anime that raise to the quality of this piece of art,itself included. The quality in sound and...animation alone is equal to none. The story itself doesn't fall far behind. If there ever was one series that deserved an actual perfect score is this one.Plenty of people from what i was able to gather mostly dislike this movie series also because it's the sakura route... Non-sense. There's no bad route when it comes to this series.All in all, a must watch, although i'd recommend you watch Fate/Zero and Fate/stay Night Unlimited Blade works before."
Mononoke Movie: Karakasa,"In the original anime, Form, Truth, and Reasoning was needed to unsheathe Kusuriuri's sword as both a plot element and as a narrative function to unravel the mystery to the viewer. One of the things Mononoke did so well was creating sympathy for the monster; we learn what they are, who they are (or were), and how they came to be. Like all the best ghost stories, behind every mononoke's manifestation was a human tragedy.It's in this that Karakasa disappoints, despite the same form being employed. Lots of plot threads and characters, but nothing that gives substance to the monster itself. ""I'm the mononoke, by...the way,"" wasn't its quote upon appearing in force against against Kusuriuri, but it might as well have been. The intention might have been to tell its story in parallel to other certain characters, but the execution was such that it instead felt unrelated; almost like a footnote to a less interesting story.When the heart and substance of the story is lacking, what it has is the beautiful and whimsical art style, backed by movie production values; but not much else.7, but a biased 7 in favour anything Mononoke.Note - this movie is part of a trilogy set in the same location, from my understanding, so hopefully some of the flaws (if not all) are just those of an incomplete story."
"Ore wa Subete wo ""Parry"" suru: Gyaku Kanchigai no Sekai Saikyou wa Boukensha ni Naritai","I Parry Everything has a humorous take on isekai anime. Noor, seemingly with no talent, has the best talent of all and that's being able to parry everything. Absurdly strong and extremely oblivious to his own skill, this anime follows him on his adventures in a funny and lighthearted way.The characters outside of Noor are very uninteresting and they serve no purpose other than to be some humorous obstacle towards Noor.The animation good, but not great. Nothing to really say in this area of series.Not a great plot and is very simple. You get the cliche protagonist, him being dim-witted, and the battles are...very repetitive. It's a quick watch and enjoyable but don't expect much from it."
Aoi Sekai no Chuushin de,"It's dumb fun. A 3 for quality brought up to a 6 for being a silly, good time.If you're wondering if this is some sort of hidden gem? Not really. But it's cheesy and kinda bad but in a fun way. I wouldn't say it's ""so bad it's good,"" but if you're a Sega fan and like pointing at the random little references (at least 1/3 of the MC's lines are just SA1 quotes in the dub), it's worth a shot, especially if you can get friends along for the ride to riff on it a bit. Just keep in mind there's there's some of...that classic ""2000s anime pervertry,"" even if it finished airing the same year as ""Attack on Titan"" started.Otherwise this is a safe skip."
Goblin Slayer,"Goblin Slayer is such a double edged sword. For every good thing, there is something atrocious to counteract it. It is hard to formulate everything as a proper written essay so I will do really long bullet points.GOOD:====- It looks like it was written by someone who understands RPGs. I have always thought the spellcasting from D&D was interesting so it's nice to see it here. It's not about shitting out fireballs, it's about having spells with limited uses and trying to maximize their utility. If you spam everything, you won't have them when you need them.- This is not a power fantasy. Goblin slayer...is not an all powerful protagonist. He is someone who shows that he deserves to win due to resourcefulness and planning.- Goblin Slayer is not really a hero nor a good role model for a hero. He is just someone driven by revenge and has a particular obsession with killing goblins specifically. Killing goblins won't save the world, but that's the only role he is interested in.- The show does a good job of portraying plausible reason for why he is obsessed with goblins.- The fights happen often and are interesting.- The music is very hype sometimes and fits the world.- The environments are drawn well.====BAD:====- Flattest characters in existence. Priest be nice. Confident elf do be arguing with dwarf (real creative). Lizard man be eatin cheese. Goblin slayer be wantin to kill goblins. That's all there is.- Goblin Slayer's dialogue is annoying and pointless as fuck. Everything is ""Okay"", ""I see"", etc.- Everyone else's dialogue is only slightly less trash. This is the worst show for watching characters talk.- Fanservice doesn't happen often, but when it does it's kinda too much.- Shoehorned harem aspect that doesn't make sense because they tried to establish Goblin Slayer as a weirdo at the start.- Animation is meh.Watch this if you wanna see goblins get killed in various ways. Don't watch if you expect good dialogue or characters."
Hyouka,"The first time I watched Hyouka I was half asleep in the middle of the night, binging it until the next morning. However, that severely diminished my viewer experience. I was taking everything at face value. I assumed Oreki meant everything he said. I did not understand a lot of the sentences. I did not appreciate the animation because I was so focused on getting through it. In the end I thought it was an okay show and I moved on.However, rewatching it now, it is much better than I thought. Oreki doesn't actually mean what he says. When he monologues about other people's rosy...high school lives compared to his ""gray"" life, it is not him being edgy. It is his acceptance of where he is. He prefers his simple, low energy life because he hasn't really found anything to enjoy or dedicate himself to.When he joins the Classic Literature club, he is nervous about this change in his life. In a way, I kind of relate to this position. I am assuming he was worried about being disappointed. He didn't want to get into activities that expend energy and might not be fulfilling for him. At the same time, if it is possible to bring color to his life, he doesn't mind it. He is unsure whether it will eventually be a good or bad thing, but he secretly hopes that it is a good thing.Hyouka is not only a story of Oreki bringing color to his life, but also the development of his 3 other clubmates. I cannot tell you their stories because that would be a spoiler, but I just wanted you to know that the drama does not revolve around only Oreki. Oreki and clubmates solve low-stake mysteries together. This is the first time I've been invested in mysteries that, in the grand scheme of things, don't really change anything.Although I have no attachment to any of the characters (maybe Oreki a tiny bit), I cannot deny that they are well written. They are not as well written as Skip and Loafer, but that's a really high bar for anime. Hyouka still has better characters than most anime. Chitanda's energy and persistence gives plausible reason for Oreki to be solving puzzles. Fukube is an interesting character by himself, but he also acts as a counterweight to Oreki. When Oreki disagrees with Fukube, it's as if Oreki is having an internal dialogue with his self doubts. It also works the other way around. Ibara doesn't play too large of a role in the story, usually just being the straight man, but she is an okay character either.The animation is great, the drama is great, the mysteries are great. I am keeping it at an 8 now because I'm still rewatching the start.EDIT: It's a bit slow so Im lowering it to a 7. That's still a good rating thought."
Ore dake Level Up na Ken: ReAwakening,"Don’t read unless you’ve watched S1.I watched the movie a day before the release. It’s a nice recap of the beginning (double dungeon incident) and how he became the “player” and the 3 essential fights of s1. Fight against the blue serpent, the group that tried to kill him 3 times and Igris fight. It skipped majority of everything else and added little details from other episodes recapping it well. Then came the first 2 episodes of S2 and it was very well animated and captivated the cinema well. Read the manga and it was adapted well.I mainly watched this to see the first...two episodes of S2 but it was a well put movie mainly for additional income however I enjoyed it and Im keen to see the rest of S2. From the way the first two episodes looked it’s looking very promising.Watch it if you have time and wanna see it early and witness peak.Watched this on the 4th of December in the uk, a day before the UK release."
Lupin the Third: Mine Fujiko to Iu Onna,"7.0/10 ~ Highly recommend this one just on the art styleMan this one was quite the treat to watch for the visuals alone. They really just made it feal like an oldschool manga or art book from the 70's come alive in animated form. The amount of work that went into each scene, every set piece, every episode is crazy to think of much akin to watching something like Red line, I wouldnt be surprised if there is overlapping staff there to be honest.I may have grown up watching some Lupin iii, but I really do not have much love for it, that being...said this did not have to be nostalgic to be good. Which I am always here for, as I can truly view this without some rose tinted glasses unlike so many.The charecters were written to the T of how they are through out Lupin's series but here you get a diffrent taste of how they theoretically could have met as the cannon of this seems to be a bit murky. That being said we dont watch lupin for extremely deep charecters or deep plots, so nothing new here. You also just have to be prepared for it being episodic with fairly independent stories, a bit of a thing from the past that most people are not use to in this day in age.The sound track is spectacular, this has to be up there with Cowboybebop or Shamploo for how good it was consistently.My biggest complaint is the show was a bit too sexual, I wouldnt be surprised by stats if Fujiko had her tits out for almost 50% of all screen time she was actually on. And this is coming from someone who quite enjoys such things... made the moments feel less special if you know what I mean.  All that being this is show is so good that you can just kinda ignore the titties and its still quite good.6.5 and above is where I start to actually personally recommend shows, and remember 5/10 is average so this is well above that. Cheers"
Horimiya,"I'm not a fan of romance, I'm really completely sure that I'm not at all the target audience for this anime... Still, I liked it. I really don't consider it to be a very impressive anime, nor do I think it has anything in particular to highlight. It was just okay. I'm also not sure if it's really a romantic comedy, it doesn't really have much comedy...I recommend this anime if:- You are a fan of calm romantic comedies.- You want something light but romantic to watch.I don't recommend this anime if:- You have a strong desire to see a super intricate story, full of...mystery and suspense, drama, or action.- You come with some kind of expectation to fulfill.- You think this anime is a romantic comedy. It's not. It's simply romantic.--------Español--------No soy un fanático del romance, realmente estoy completamente seguro de que no soy para nada el objetivo de este anime... Aún así me gustó. Realmente no considero que sea un anime muy impresionante, tampoco considero que tenga nada, en particular que recalcar. Simplemente estuvo bien. Tampoco estoy seguro de que sea realmente una comedia romántica, mucha comedia no tiene realmente...Recomiendo este anime, sí:- Eres fanático de las comedias románticas tranquilas.- Quieres algo ligero pero que sea de romance para poder ver.No recomiendo este anime, sí:- Tienes grandes deseos de ver una historia super intrincada, llena de misterio y suspenso, drama o acción.- Llegas con algún tipo de expectativa que rellenar.- Crees que este anime es una comedia romántica. No lo es. Es simplemente romántica."
Midori no Hibi,"My Right Hand becomes my Girl Friend(?)If any of u are here after seeing a clip where the male Lead is on rejection streak and thought that maybe he is just a chill guy who made a hand puppet for fun , u are sooo wrong (prolly no one but me thought this but this is not a porblem at all)The 1st episode was rather interesting , weird but felt promising. The main lead takes a rather smart approach and tries his best to solve this new inconvenience. But for some reason things didnt went as they shldve and the plot was extended to 13...ep!Nothing really progressive happens until a childhood friend of the female lead is introduced.. basically its just 2+last 4ep,Even if u skip the the middle episodes it wouldn't effect the way u might view the story. One might argue that the we could miss the bonding between the leads but there was none tbh, its just the fl fangirling all the time, and male lead acting like he doesnt care.. not once does he get a strange feeling about the situation he is in, only couple of instances where she tries too heard and he views her ""not as a burden"".tldr: poor writing , this story needs good chemistry being developed between the main leads to connect the promising start and the way it ended. but terribly failed at it, instead we are gifted with forced comedy and nudity."
Dungeon Meshi,"Dungeon Meshi was my first anime I have watched besides Ghibli movies in like 7 years. Thankfully it was the best anime to kickstart my growing anime obsession. I love the interactions between the characters and their relationships, I love how the main characters seem like stereotypical characters at first but have very different personalities than expected. For example, Laios seems like your generic blond knight jock at first look but you learn very quickly he *is* autism. There is minimal fan service other than the Falin and Marcille bath scene and Falins boobs popping out in another scene. Well there is Senshi's panty shots...if that is your kinda thing lol. The character designs are so unique and diverse but in a very natural way. It is my 3rd favorite anime behind Attack on Titan and Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood"
Shoushimin Series,"It's insane how this show's score is above 7. And it's so questionable how anyone can enjoy this, who saw more than 2 animes in their lives.The characters are meaningless, they have nothing to say. Their personalities are stucked with the ""I like sweets"" and in ""I'm so smart"". Their conversations are boring it's not bringing the story everywhere.So then the story should be interesting and making the show to move forward, right? Well, in this case it's not happening. The so called plot is a joke. They're solving so serious problems like where is the purse or where are the dirty dishes. Really...interesting.The real problem is that they're trying to be so serious about this. If this would be a parody, it would be way much more enjoyable.They're trying to be dramatic with the low or no music and slow talking (what is talking about how the girl wants to eat cake) and mix this dramatic atmosphere with the ""intense"" mystery solving. But creaters couldn't tell the difference between dramatic and boring :(The art is the most enjoyable part. But there are lots of weird bodies/faces. Not enough money. Sure. Only a pretty art is still not enough for a good story."
Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"A show with a lot of potential dismantled by a perplexing romance pairing.This story centers around the protagonist - Jill - who starts off as sixteen, as her ""beloved"" crown prince sets out to kill her...and succeeds. Thus, she is reborn into her own life - brought back to when she was ten years old. I do really love these types of stories! In particular, 7th Time Loop: The Villainess Enjoys a Carefree Life Married to Her Worst Enemy!Watching a protagonist get to re-do their mistakes and make better choices is very appealing to watch - I mean who wouldn't love to get to...do that with their own life?However, despite this being a beloved trope of mine - this story didn't meet the potential it so very well could have. For me, at least.Here's for the: WHY?The biggest letdown for me was the age gap of the love pairing. While both characters, in their own right, were interesting, charming, and endearing - having Jiil (a ten-year-old) partnered romantically with Rave (a nineteen-year-old) made for uncomfortable story telling. Being perfectly candid.Recently, there have been quite a few age-gap romance animes to come out, but this one is the most startling of all. For example - A Girl and her Guard Dog and I'll Become a Villainess Who Goes Down in History - to name a few. However, to give those shows credit, the female protagonists were at least teenagers.Jill being ten for the remainder of the show as the love story progresses - for me - becomes increasingly more uncomfortable. Which, again, was disappointing as the story itself was truly an entertaining watch despite that element.I know the summary of this story talks of their ages, so people should go into this expecting to get just that - but I truly thought that the writers were going to handle it differently.How I envisioned it going was that when she was killed at sixteen, and thus reborn to being ten, she would propose to the Dragon King to avoid her perilous fate with the Crown Prince. But...then, after the proposal, they would progress the story back to her being sixteen and showing how different her life is her second time around.She being sixteen also would have made a lot more sense regarding many of the plot points - aside from the romance. For instance, Jill is portrayed as being incredibly strong, but it's hard to imagine that a ten-year-old is as strong and powerful as she is. It would have been more believable to see her at sixteen with such immense powers. Also, she takes on a leadership role with military men that again - being a ten-year-old is hard to fathom...Would adult men really surrender to a ten-year-old's orders even with their capabilities? Unlikely.Despite all that, as I said, the story was pretty fun even with the critiques.As for a quick synopsis on the remainder of the show's elements - the art wasn't bad, but some of the recent romance animes have really been coming up with great stuff and this definitely doesn't uphold the standards they have set. Sound was fine, again, nothing overwhelming bad nor good.As for whether I recommend this? I think it depends on what your comfort level is. If you can handle age gap stories, then by all means give it a try. But if you're similar to me, and it's not necessarily your cup of tea, then I would steer clear."
ReLIFE,"This is my first review, and for good reason. This show wasted my time and ultimately left me upset. After watching the first episode, I was hooked! However, this feeling did not stick around.Story: This guy is unhappy with his current life and is offered to take a pill to appear younger and attend high school. This show had the potential to be a masterpiece but just decided not to be. Before I go any further I want to applaud the fact that this show did not sexualize high school girls. I really appreciated that and it made it so much easier to watch....The main character was surprisingly not a pedo and actively reminded himself these girls are in high school and romanticizing them is weird. However, this did not cover up the fact that the story just wasn't there. 90% of this show was following high school girls drama and 10% was actually ReLIFE related. Most of the episodes would follow side characters and their drama and at the last second a ReLIFE related scene would appear. Effectively reminding you that there is still a story and not just mindless drama. Just for the next episode to be more mindless drama. Ultimately this show is a lot of stupid and random drama that has NOTHING to do with the main character or the story.Animation: This show has the standard box style animation that was around from the 2010-2020 era. It's right in between a vintage anime style and the new style we know today. It's just boring. Characters look like they are boxes and have no depth.Characters: wow wow wow are these guys boring. A lot of this show is just characters misunderstanding each others feelings and not effectively communicating. Which makes sense for a high school setting however I feel the author uses this excuse to just create mindless drama and draw out the story. Our main character doesn't really have that much depth to him. he's just a guy who didn't take advantage of his early life and the show doesn't even really address this fully. Like I said 90% of this show is mindless drama.Final Thoughts: I was really excited for this show but it just fell flat. the author had so much potential yet did nothing with it. such a shame that a 10/10 story was wasted on this flop.TLDR: Cool Premise with poor executionStory: 5/10 Has potential to be amazing just takes the wrong routeAnimation: 2/10 standard box animation styleCharacters: 3/10 boring, boring, and more boringScore: 3.3/10"
Black★Rock Shooter (OVA),"I did cry during one scene, so this OVA was almost perfection. Montages were cute, conversations felt real enough, the emotions of the characters were beautifully shown, and the battle-scene-alternate-universe metaphor was well-done.... Then I realized that no one learned their lesson. The post-credits scene made it worse. Am I supposed to only have one friend? Am I supposed to disappear to make my bestie worry and suffer so that they pay attention to me? That sounds like a wonderful idea according to this anime.I'm not sure what else to write here without giving away spoilers, the plot is generic but good. Visuals are...fun and long humans are fun to watch battle and walk. I just can't bring myself to give it a higher score with the writing at the end."
Delico's Nursery,"I’m not sure if it’s the story itself or just this anime adaptation, but this one is a flop.There are two different plot lines/components to Delico’s Nursery: the aristocratic/government/conspiracy plot and the child rearing plot. And they do not do a good job of balancing or connecting the two. They very much feel like two separate plot lines and as someone who loves childcare anime and started this specifically because of that, the children really do not add anything to the plot other than to be, quite frankly, annoying.The plot itself has its own issues, the main one being the 11 episode build...up to probably one of the most anticlimactic plot resolutions I’ve ever seen. The ending is also super unsatisfactory and you’re left with a lot of unanswered questions.I will say that the characters designs are great. The soundtrack is as well, but a lot of the time it’s so loud you can’t even hear the dialogue.Overall, there are much better bureaucratic, vampire, and childcare anime out there, and while I commend this anime for trying to combine all three, it probably would have been better if they didn’t."
"Shangri-La Frontier: Kusoge Hunter, Kamige ni Idoman to su 2nd Season","One of those series that should've stuck with 1 season.We all know what I'm talking about, this season only exists because season 1 was a success, not because this is any good. They're milking another season out of something popular that's it. There's nothing actually good here. Nothing remains of what made season 1 good. There is no focus on Sunraku managing his debuff or actually getting stronger and the entire Lycagon thing looks like it might be for season 12 at this rateThis is just another generic mmo series at this point like we have 3 every season."
Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann,"Loved it. It had every sort of emotions. I don't know why it is so much underrated. At first I thought of dropping it because its animation was old but I am glad I finished it. Poor Simon he was the one who wanted to be with everyone but everyone just depended on him.No one understood him. His feelings, He lost his closest friend due to his own fear, he lost his love. His most closest one deceived him. He became so lonely. Loved his character so much. Best MC! He was the only character I liked and he was the only one who...carried the show"
Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san,"While it is true that Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san may not be the most ""out there"" show when it comes to the realm of yuri anime and some of its ""cats and dogs"" jokes may fall flat on the faces of some members of the audience, I would still recommend it to enjoyers of  the girl's love genre.Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san's main strength lies on how short in is (in fact, I managed to finished this series on one single swoop during a morning evening). Some would say that the source material of this show wouldn't be nearly enough to adapt it into a full-length anime,...and while I necessarily wouldn't agreed with them, I'll give credit were credit is due that the show spawn of this series certainly helps with the overall pace of things going on in screen.The anime on itself is a pretty standard yuri for what it is worth: two very different girls falling in love as the series progresses towards its ending. Some others secondary characters are introduced through the show (some of them having romantic affairs between them all of their own) mainly to spice things up a bit, which I'll admit, they do pretty well. Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san wouldn't be not feel the same without its backround characters.As I said before, if you are a yuri lover (like I am), and have a bit of free time between your days, I would give it a chance at this anime. It might not get your mind blown away, but it'll surely make you have a good time. And hey, aren't we all here watching anime to do precisely that, have a good time?Give it a try, you won't regret it."
Hibike! Euphonium Movie 3: Chikai no Finale,"This shouldn't have been a movie.This movie really stings for me personally because of the golden run Hibike was on before it. To preface, I haven't watched any Hibike movies as they're mostly just recaps with a few extra scenes. Season 1 was a great set up for season 2, which left off at a sad yet exciting conclusion to see what would come next. This movie isn't bad by any means, but compared to what Hibike was building, it dropped the bar.It felt like it reused conflicts and character arcs that had already been done, but much better with more time in both...seasons before. It felt cheap, recycled and glossed over. The movie can be split into 3 main arcs, with 1 small subplot running underneath. All of these would be much better with even only 1 season, to get through the entire year. Even though the first year was split into 2 seasons, this part of Hibike should have had more time, because the new characters and conflicts would have had more time to develop and add some depth to them, rather than being rushed and hastily resolved in an episode's worth of time each.This movie also fails to uphold the expectations left behind by season 2, which had an amazing conclusion, leaving viewers to be waiting for more. There were many things we wanted to see, but to make the entire next year into a movie felt extremely cheap. It felt like getting rid of all the (new) 3rd years before season 3, so we could have a conclusion for Kumiko's cohort in the next season. They already pretty much got rid of Asuka and her cohort, which included many great characters, namely Asuka, but now the 2nd years too? It's pretty sad when you realise that the new first years didn't get the time to develop too well either so we're left with some good characters but not enough to carry in the 3rd years for next season, half-baked second years who you can barely remember the names of, and first years again, but this time hopefully done better.The conclusion also felt extremely disappointing, not because of the outcome, but because it wasn't the focus of the movie to actually reach the goal. They spent too much time trying to introduce and build new characters and reuse conflicts, that the main goal of the band itself became an afterthought. As such, the outcome makes sense, but still feels very wasted because of all the hype riding from the conclusion of season 2 being crushed.Even though the movie may be a failed sequel to the Hibike series (in my opinion), it isn't actually bad. The music is great of course, the characters from previous seasons are still great, and the new conflicts make a decent amount of sense, but they weren't very original. Kanade is a good foil to Kumiko, and Kumiko has developed greatly, with her taking herself and the club seriously and earnestly, while helping ease tensions as she always does. Kanade forces Kumiko to utilize her experience, and deal with these issues directly through herself, without relying on anyone. Though Kumiko is great in this movie, many past and new characters are unfortunately side-lined for the most part.Reina, Mizore, Nozomi, Yuuko, maybe Natsuki, and many other second years, third years and first years barely have any dialogue. Nozomi and Mizore have their own movie, so they don't really matter, but Natsuki and Yuuko are central characters, and letting them leave the cast with not even a proper conclusion or farewell is straight disrespectful. The second years barely have any dialogue either,  it would have been nice to get some more dialogue/screen time from them, especially because they all made relations with different first years, and having more from them could help develop the first years too, preparing for the new cast that would be introduced in season 3.Shuuichi is one of the characters most butchered, with him being given no screentime, except to be used as a tool by them to ""develop"" Kumiko by giving her an obstacle to move forward from. First of all, this should definitely not have happened in this movie, maybe near the end of the third year, but definitely not the second year. Hibike had been keeping a good distance from romance, and it was a good decision. And to all the people who had random ships, Shuuichi is the romantic interest no matter what you say, and it was obvious since the moment he was introduced. Even if he was, this was not the right moment, which was even emphasized by how trivialized it became near the end, a development to be retried later, or offscreen. A failure, you could say.All in all this movie is fine, but for Hibike fans like myself who were excited for what was to come, it’s a disrespectful gesture to all the characters and events that lead up to this point in the story, just to make this mediocre continuation. As I stated before, this wouldn’t have been as bad if there was a series behind it, but there isn’t and this is the only adaptation we’ll get of their second year, which was supposed to be the year that Asuka and the other graduates hyped up in their conclusion. Again, I wouldn’t have minded this outcome had it been explored and done in depth, instead of glossing over things and proving no real reason for anything. Hopefully season 3 can save the show, because it really felt like season 2 was leading into something amazing."
Ninja Kamui,"Very good anime until chapter 4.From this point:- Mech armor ruins combat. Less blood, less impact, less possibility of complicated strategies, less development of shinobi skills.- The animation begins to deteriorate. It's not a bad CGI, but it's very poorly implemented.The mecha battles are simply slashes and sparks, unlike the first combats, where the movements and choreography were better.- The story stops being interesting. The ""villain"" turns out to be an idiot. And the Organization, which the exiles fear so much, only the first 4 episodes are really scary. Then they mostly become NPCs waiting to be killed....- Some plotstwist come from nowhere. They have no impact or logical explanation. And I'm not just talking about the story, but there are even scenes that don't make sense (For example, at one point X character uses a hook to fight and, literally 5 seconds later, falls into the void thinking ""oh no, I'm dead"".. .i mean, use your hook dude)Anyway. Didn't like it.Excelent animation and great potential at the beginning, all thrown away in chapter 4 when that whole feeling of human fragility and ""every little decision counts"" was lost.The anime proposed rules that later became irrelevant."
Sirius,"Sirius the Jaeger is a cool, creative take on vampires and the activity of hunting them, notable most of all for its pretty outstanding production value, the anime only held back by the sense that those responsible for its story didn't quite know how to finish it. beginning with the story, Sirius the Jaeger presents us with a bustling world with secrets just beneath the surface, alive with intrigue and mystery, and wreathed by the supernatural. Vampires exist, and coordinate together to victimize humans and eventually rule the world, while various organizations of so-called jaegers exist solely to hunt them all down. It's a great...setup, and for most of the show provides an excellent formula for continued suspense and action-packed staying power. It also blends classic horror tropes with their own unique concepts, be it vampires, werewolf themes, or even nods to Frankenstien. The secret conflict between the vampires and the jaeger company known as V shipping remains engaging throughout as well, especially with how it bewilders regular authorities and also sweeps up regular people in its wake, bringing in new characters with their own conflicts and interests at just the right time to shake things up. it's not all praise for Sirius the Jaeger, however. Notably, the major flaw in the story and, indeed, the major flaw with the show as a whole is how it handles its ending. It feels like it has no real clue how to end it at all, in fact. I'm not going to spoil anything here, though it must be said that while subverting expectations and flipping major motivations at the end of a show is a popular trope, it doesn't really work in this instance, and feels so halfhearted anyway that it just ends up feeling like a canned ending. Pair this with the fact that the big MacGuffin they've been chasing this whole time never really gets properly defined beyond the fact that it's an artifact of knowledge, despite its big reveal and vague definitions throughout the show, it's a rather lazy and disappointing landing for an otherwise great anime.Now, on to the strongest aspect of this anime, the art- Sirius the Jaeger looks fantastic on the face of it, but there's much more to its visual style and art direction than simply looking good. Not only is the world rich with color and design at every turn, with strikingly unique character designs, and brought to life with scenes of intense and complex combat, but it is also elevated by the considerations it has for the smallest details. Some notable examples include when a car crashes and slams against the side of a bridge due to its momentum during a chase scene, how someone's body twists as they're shot midair, and the subtle particle dynamics that play out when vampires turn to glimmering ashes. It is in this detail that the true beauty of the show lies, and is the defining feature of Sirius the Jaeger.The sound is also quite good, with strong voice work and a powerful, engaging soundtrack that uses classical elements to its advantage, with a throughline of other genres to set the mood. Altogether, it makes it feel suitably grand, otherworldly, and high-stakes.The characters are good, meeting all basic standards of quality, though it definitely feels as though they're being moved around by the story, lacking a certain agency. Still, they fill their roles well in that story, and in light of the grand mystery surrounding them, it doesn't feel out of place. Also, while most of V shipping feels a little forgettable, they still work together well. Of the cast, my favorites are the protagonist Yuily, and the leader of the vampires, Yevgraf, both until the end of the show, that is. Yuily is a solemn, determined character who is resolutely badass in all of his scenes, but I don't really like the bizarre alteration made to his motivations in the last couple of episodes. As for Yevgraf, he is a sinister and grand villain, with a certain dark majesty about him that absolutely nails the persona of a Machiavellian vampiric patriarch. That is, of course, until the very end, when he becomes a bog-standard megalomaniac, complete with all the strategic mismanagement that entails. Overall, Sirius the Jaeger is a gorgeous anime with an attention to detail that is commendable and immersive, and a story that is mysterious and exciting until its vague and lackluster ending. If it nailed that ending, this anime would have easily netted a higher score. In the end, I recommend it anyway, as the journey itself was more than worth it, and it still stands on its own as something fundamentally good, even with that flop of an ending."
Noein: Mou Hitori no Kimi e,"A very rough cut gem that will appeal to some, and not to others.This series is the imperfect attempt at a magnum opus of one Kazuki Akane, someone who has been involved extensively with many fantastic and well known works, essentially a who's-who list of big name titles for anyone of a certain generation of anime enthusiast. However, his involvement has often been one of medium-to-high-impact but low-visibility, with the exception of his involvement with 'Escaflowne' in which he was deeply and somewhat more visibly involved. This series, however, is one of only two of Akane's work on which he can be said to have...his shot at becoming a true auteur (the other being Heat Guy J, which I am yet to see).It is impossible to evaluate Noein without this kind of meta awareness of Akane's career trajectory I believe. Right down to his frequent credits as a storyboard artist, which clearly influenced the odd, but effective way that the series blends disparate and incompatible animation styles in a very self-conscious and intentional way. Much of the action involves animation that seems more like detailed colourings of storyboards somebody left out (think a less experimental version of 'Kid's Story' from 'The Animatrix'), while effective use of 3D animation is made to accentuate the weird and alien quality of certain settings, characters and objects. Rather than attempt the kind of blending that was typical of this time period, which neither looked particularly good to contemporary eyes, nor aged well, Akane's use of various animation styles ages all the better in not attempting to fool the viewer, but rather achieve artistic and thematic effect. I spend so much time on this minor point because the inconsistency in the animation is something which I have seen repeatedly mentioned in negative reviews here, and I so I feel this is worth spending some times emphasising.That being said, the animation does have its issues. The more orthodox animated segments can be.... rough. The style between characters is inconsistent in a way that never quite stopped feeling jarring and uncanny. I don't know if this was an intentional choice, as the character of Haruka, around whom every character and the entire storyline revolve, for better or for worse, is obviously the greatest example of odd and inconsistent character design and animation. But if it is intentional, it is hard for me to understand its exact purpose.More broadly, the narrative and characters really make you work very hard... This series feels like panning for gold, and although you do find it with some regularity, it can feel like labouring under a hot sun without any guarantees at times. Partly, I stuck with the series simply because it was a series which somebody with whom I am close with emphasised its personal importance to them so strongly, however there were also moments when after some teeth pulling, the series really did pay off in such a way that I felt my investment was being rewarded. This kind of pattern covers everything from understanding or caring about the narrative, character development, interactions, and relationships, and action sequences. This is most definitely an exemplar of the classic trope of the anime your friend tells you to just watch 6 more episodes and they promise it will get good.It is only a certain kind of person I think who will enjoy or be glad to have watched this series, and that is, returning to my initial point, the type of person for whom experiencing a glimpse inside the mind of a great craftsman who never managed to fully become an artist is something they will appreciate. Someone who likes to see the imperfection of someone trying and just about succeeding, to do something different and fully their own.The series ultimately explores some interesting themes, and returning to my panning for gold metaphor, the hard work of enduring some of the more insufferable character moments are precisely set ups for important and far more interesting character development later down the line. The character of Yuu for example is an utter misery for at least the first half of the series if not more, but it is precisely this total unlikeability that pays off so well at the 11th hour in understanding both the motivation for the entire plot, and delivering a core part of the series' philosophical reflection.I've written a lot here that can honestly be summed up succinctly by the very first sentence of this review, and so I will not belabour the point too much further, however to reiterate, this series is one for those who want to watch something imperfect, but sincere, and genuinely unique. While there are clear influences from works like 'Neon Genesis Evangelion', 'Rahxephon', 'Escaflowne', and perhaps even 'Serial Experiments Lain', this series is definitely something not quite like anything I've seen before. However it will test your patience at times, even if you're the kind of person who gets a kick out of the off-kilter. Yet there was something that kept me coming back, and I am in fact glad to have experienced everything it had to offer. It truly was something different, and by the end of the series I found myself surprisingly attached to some of the characters and the outcome of the story, not to mention the very interesting way it explored SciFi concepts like quantum entanglement and instability, multi-universe theories and such.If you haven't been turned off by this review, I really do suggest giving this series a shot, I promise it gets good after just like 8 more episodes bro, please bro, just trust me bro I mean it!"
Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 3rd Season,"Wonderful! The dedication they are putting into this third season is remarkable. Unlike the second one, which had many technical errors.Our GOAT Subaru shows sensational development. This arc will have one of the best fights in the series Reinhard and Subaru Vs Regulus. Looking forward to February! Priscilla Vs Sirius, Julius Vs Gluttony, I hope they use this split-cour well to make these fights memorable. I liked Capella's dubbing too, it conveyed the feeling I felt in the novel. Rating 10 so far. I had doubts about this new director but he has been doing a good job. what are you waiting to watch...the best isekai ever made?"
Ore dake Level Up na Ken: ReAwakening,"Saw yesterday at the cinema the film retraces the entire first season showing only 3 complete fights, then the first 2 episodes of the second season that should be released in 2025 are shown in preview.Both I and the other people in the room were slightly upset about seeing a ""film"" that is actually just a summary of the first season with the pieces of the anime glued together, we would have preferred to see only the first 2/3 episodes of the new season.It must be said that the facts shown in the first 2 episodes of the second season are the same as those...shown in the original Manhwa and the fights are very well done."
Senryuu Shoujo,"QUICK-it's short-it's wholesome-no drama-nice characters-easy to watch-not overdone-little amount of fanserviceThis is a short anime based on not-so-short manga. The manga consists mostly of short 4-panel strips mostly, interweaved with longer stories arranged traditionally. And the anime follows that with 12 10-minute long episodes. There's no overarching plot. Episodes are self-contained. There is the beginning and ending however, which is important given the format. If you need more, you can hop on the manga train and get more.That aside, this is one of the nicest series I've seen. And by that I don't mean it's overflowing with cuteness, moe, pouring sugar into your eyes...and ears and all that. It's just reasonably nice and it doesn't try too hard.FMC is Nanako - she isn't mute as some claim, but she communicates with 5-7-5 text instead of talking. Komi instantly comes to mind as a comparison, but Nanako is so much better. She's not overly shy, she's open and friendly, like a normal girl would be. She likes the MC very much. I must say the english VA gave her the most endearing voice I've heard. Fits the character perfectly.MC is Eiji, a thug-looking guy. He's intimidating to most, a bit oblivious, but very kind hearted and friendly.Other characters I'd say are your typical mix of high-school individuals with various traits, having various adventures and shenanigans. There are no villains, noone is irritating, no screeching girls.Technical aspects are just fine, nothing to write essays over, nothing to criticise. Animation is okay, music fits. Dubbing is very nice.But the biggest value of this show is it's ability to make me smile. That's the most important thing I want to pass to you, dear reader."
Look Back,"It was honestly amazing how much I ended up going into this with the 6/10 mindset, only to finish the movie with a 9/10 review. I genuinely shouldn't have doubted the genius of Tatsuki FujimotoI was initially going into this movie after having rolled my eyes over the premise of""Wow, self-aware anime character wants to be a mangaka"" AND ""They are going to delve into a deep analysis of the difficulties of being a Mangaka?"" daring today aren't we.Going into this anime, I have always hated this trope in anime where the medium dissects its own production and creation process. While I can...see why people like it, I do not. I don't like it when shows or anime break the 4th wall and build the plot of the show around the premise of how the medium I am watching is made.It is cool for people who are also within that medium and who enjoy these self dysecting premises, but I personally hate it as it simply wakes me up from the fleeting feeling of being invested in the story.That saidThis movieFlipped all of my expectations on its headIt got me absolutely hooked on the premise, and kept doing twists and turns within the story that made me feel further and further invested as the story progressed. The more I watched without stopping for an already long night, the more I kept being unable to stop myself from watching further to where the plot was going.It was an amazing movie and the fact that it were only 1h long was the perfect cherry as it did not make me feel like the story was becoming drawn out. I do believe, at the very end, there could have been more silence and literal frames of the character just taking in the moment of what was happening, instead of jumping straight in, but at this point I'm nit-picking.Its a good movie, I liked it, go watch it."
Strike Witches OVA,"This is literally just a short promotion for the show, and I haven't even watched the show it is trying to promote. Now, did this grab my attention to make me watch the show? I guess. This show is an absurdist's delight. A delicate balance of every other school anime that has come around, plotted alongside the military training hellscape of a futuristic, war-trodden world. Anime girls are A-10's. It's ridiculous in every sense, but that's fucking entertainment at it's finest.I was sold for the first minute or so of this. Once the more character driven aspects picked up, I couldn't be bothered to...care. It's a very basic, formulaic story that has been done a million times over. It's insanely face paced and not for its own good. The characters are very uninteresting as it is, they throw around these names like we are supposed to recognize them later on. Fan service shots are sprinkled in with zero purpose, possibly only to show that this show will have sexual content, getting everyone's panties in a bunch. It's all very sloppily done in order to just show us how the series will be.We are supposed to care about these girls fighting in a war that we have no idea about. They say the enemies are ""unknown"", whatever that means. I'd say this is watchable, mainly due to it being so short. So if you are interested, give it a watch. Besides that, this OVA tries to do too much in too little time, causing total failure in the final minutes."
"Tsuma, Shougakusei ni Naru.","This show is an absolute masterpiece. From the very first episode, it captivates with its brilliant storytelling, complex characters, and breathtaking visuals. The plot is both gripping and unpredictable, leaving you eagerly awaiting what comes next. The performances by the cast are outstanding, each actor bringing depth and authenticity to their role. The writing is sharp and thoughtful, filled with moments that provoke deep emotional reactions and thoughtful reflection. Whether it's the stunning cinematography, the rich world-building, or the flawless direction, every element of this show works in harmony to create something truly exceptional. It's a must-watch for anyone looking for a show that offers...both entertainment and substance."
Fairy Gone,"The setting is great, absolutely fantastic, I was often fascinated by the entire environment that surrounded the characters and, despite my mixed feelings about the anime, I can understand why someone would want to see it and rewatch and rewatch... That said... unfortunately It didn't captivate me enough to watch until the end, I don't know why, since I usually like this type of anime but after 5 episodes... I don't know... Has it lost its appeal? I don't know how to explainI'll probably try to review it with more ""mature eyes"" but, for now, it's just a very forced ""good""..."
Monster,"There is a ""before"" and ""after"" with Monster. I think it's one of the best anime ever made. The main and side characters are brilliant and well-written. The drama is always present. One of the best antagonists of all time, Johan, a true monster without redemption, facing Dr. Tenma, a genuinely good person who dedicates his life to saving others. The story spans more than 70 chapters set in Germany and the Czech Republic. The pacing is superb, and the cities are well portrayed. The realism presenting the arms, trainings, assesinatios is superb. It make justice. When you see a training cop, it moves like...a training persona. Otherwise, a novice hands a weapon with difficulty. This is just a little example of how well written the story is. You can see the terror in the faces of the characters when they deal a stressfull situation.  Just watch it. Don't miss it."
Clannad: After Story,"from the art style to the music, story and characters... everything about this anime is unique and heartwarming. it's a bit on the heavy side and is philosophical, too. the art style makes you feel nostalgic about the 2000's and really suits the atmosphere of it. the ending and the whole parallel realm sub-plot might leave you in an unsatisfied state, to avoid that, i'd watch clannad and play the vn or just read about it on the internet because it's really not that hard to understand it. don't approach it as something 'realistic' just because it has a plot heavily relied on life experiences,...time and people. if you're not new to anime, it'll probably be a 10/10 for you (+if you have some great taste,,)"
Samurai Champloo,"In my friend group, we like to debate/argue over which work of Shinichiro Watanabe is better: the space adventure Cowboy Bebop, or the wandering ronin story Samurai Champloo. I've always argued for Bebop, solely for two reasons: it annoyed the Champloo fan of our group, and it had been the only one I had seen until recently and therefore better by default. However, now that I have finished both I can safely say that it... is a toss-up. I'll refrain from making too many references between the two, but overall I can say that both are very good.One benefit that Champloo has over Cowboy Bebop...is immediately setting up a story. From the first episode, we are given a Point B to get to: a girl named Fuu is looking for someone and recruits two ronin, Mugen and Jin, to escort her. From there a mix of hijinks, adventure, tension, and connection ensue. Along the 26-episode journey you see the three of them play off each other in both humorous and emotional ways, growing from strangers to friends along the way. Often the three will spend the first third of the episode bickering and split up, only to come back together again to fight a common foe whose members all happen to have crossed paths with the three heroes.And when those fights happen, they are a spectacle to behold. Watanabe has created many a duel that all hold up in quality, even after two decades of breathtaking fights from other anime series. From the fluid motions of Jin's more formal swordplay to Mugen's wild dance-like style that involves his metal-lined sandals to the different rogues, bandits, and other samurai they face, each fighter's movements make them all stand out from each other. It was hard to believe that the first episode had such awesome battles that were only upped as the series continued.The group dichotomy of Champloo is another plus in its favor. The trio of Mugen, Fuu and Jin work better than the bounty hunters in my opinion. Mugen and Jin have a shared animosity towards each other that leads to the two butting heads in amusing ways, often due to Mugen's unruliness and Jin's more stoic nature. Meanwhile, Fuu will try to be the voice of reason, only to be brushed off for the time being. Even so, she is easily the glue of the group, and without her journey to find the Samurai who Smells of Sunflowers (say that five times fast) the two ronin would likely have killed each other by the second episode. It's difficult to pick a least favorite, but my favorite is easily Jin. His calm, serious-to-a-fault demeanor belies a character with heart to him, as shown in the way he treats his foes. His moments are some of the best in the series by far.The main criticism I have of the show is that it feels like it could be cut down by at least a few episodes. This is a strength Bebop has, with its episodic nature feeling like the day-to-day life of bounty hunters looking for the next job. In Champloo, an end goal is given right away, and while the series works well as is there are plenty of episodes that could be cut to speed up the pacing. I find it difficult to decide which to exclude, because in hindsight some of my favorite episodes would count as ""filler."" It's not the same as the filler arcs in old long-running shounen. The best comparison I can make is to Pokemon. The meat of the show is watching Ash fight the gym battles and earn his badges to challenge the Pokemon League. You can cut pretty much all the stuff between them and you would only miss the occasional new Pokemon caught (let's face it, Ash was never going to Catch 'em All) and ""Team Rocket is blasting off agaaaaaaaain!"" because, let's be honest, the main thing we wanted to see was the big battles. If Champloo was cut to... let's say sixteen, maybe eighteen episodes, I think it would be a 10/10. At the very least if the two before the three-part finale were removed it would help a lot. Those are fun episodes, but they definitely feel like they were added just to pad the show out.All in all, this is a great experience. It has as much beauty as you'd expect from a samurai aesthetic put in the Cowboy Bebop art style. Fun characters, amazing action, I'd recommend this to anyone looking for an older series.Now, if you've completed reading this review, I ask that you help me out. One point of contention in my friend group is which OP is better. Please leave your opinion by reacting with one of the following: ""Informative"" for Cowboy Bebop's, ""TANK"" by Seatbelts, or ""Creative"" for ""Battlecry"" by Nujabes (rest in peace) from Samurai Champloo."
Higurashi no Naku Koro ni,"Very original, interesting and creative concept. However, the reason I cannot give it a higher score is that between the psychological horror parts, it is really bad. It becomes this really shitty school harem with unfunny jokes and the ""uwu"" art style. I am assuming that this is because they want to create a stark contrast between the ""peace time"" and the ""horror time"". However, that doesn't excuse making me watch garbage after every arc. It seems that the true psychological horror is whenever they attempt to portray a school life.Another pet peeve: What the f*** is their age supposed to be? Rena and Satoko...are 2 years apart, yet Satoko is the size of a 4 year old toddler when compared to Rena, who is supposed to be a teenager. Keichi and Rena are always sitting in class with people half their size.However, I will have to admit that some aspects of the show are executed masterfully. There's a rule in horror that you shouldn't show too much. The first season does exactly that. You know that there's something up. You know that it's related to the cult, the deity and the curse that they mention. However, you don't know exactly what causes it and it largely remains a mystery. When the mood switches to ""horror mode"", it does so really well. Characters that were previously friendly and talkative become evasive as if they are trying to hide something. Their expressions change into blank or malicious. Sometimes they will even suddenly change tone or speech pattern. It is great. It is also home to some really brutal deaths and sinister environments.Although the non-horror parts are 1/10, the general idea is so good that it left a deep impression."
Delico's Nursery,"The art, the worldbuilding and the realistic character personalities are the best qualities of this anime.the child-rearing aspect felt like the story that wanted to be told and i kind of wish it just stuck to it because the antagonist group story just feels like it was thrown in haphazardly. I find the antagonists to be underdeveloped in comparison to the main characters and even the children, their ""evil plot"" is so superficial and feels like barely any thought was put into their plan. Main villain had one plan and one theoretical backup plan which he reveals a few episodes before even being close to...taking action. Both attempts failed and that was that... like dude I sat through 9 episode of this group of vampire detectives struggling to stop them all to find out they were never a threat, c'mon.also the fact that episodes 12 and 13 are pretty much the same episode with slightly different editing was a pretty irritating. why end on a recap?"
Rekishi ni Nokoru Akujo ni Naru zo,i really liked the first 2-3 episodes and i gave the series a strong 8/10 enjoying the story develpment but after that the downfall begins with the same tired formula each episode with liz's suporters plotting against alicia then alicia foils plot and tells everyone she is a villian then off to liz's suporters learning nothing to be brain washed by liz's power again rinse and repeat each episode bye the time i got to episode 10 im too far not to finsh it and suffering just to see the end i give it a 5/10 as of now i dont think it is a...bad anime but itis not a good anime either
Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica,"Madoka Magica is the perfect example of “looks can be deceiving,” and indeed it was, when any other external factors weren’t present. What I mean by this is that its popularity and its reputation as an anime that seemingly misleads people to believe its made for little girls gives it its reputation as such. This is not to say that any prior knowledge or what to expect ruins the viewing experience of this anime, quite the opposite actually. Every piece of media has to have a selling point, and for Madoka Magica, it seems to sell itself as a subversion of expectations. Now, I have...not watched any mahou shoujo up until this point, so I am unable to assess its quality as a comparison to another anime. Regardless, my expectations were quite high, not due to any expectation of what men are supposed to enjoy but rather expecting it to be a cliché portrayal of a genre made to target another demographic. At a first glance, Madoka Magica doesn’t seem like an anime that is good at attracting anyone other than little girls. This can be seen by the title’s cute lettering, the frilly dresses, and the girls themselves. Yet, even the last point has a niche other than little girls. However, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to no one that Madoka Magica is able to appeal to a larger audience to the nature of its dark themes. Deception is a huge theme in this anime, so we aren’t the only ones that are supposedly deceived.Madoka Magica is depicted in a very typical setting with characters that aren’t out of the ordinary. One of these characters is Madoka, a kind hearted hearted girl simply going about her daily life. She comes from a loving family and has a good relationship with her friends. Much of the setting conforms with the mood of the characters. For instance, her house is a brightly colored contemporary house with lots of windows and mirrors that blindfully light. Once outside, and after a good eyeball nuking, she meets up her best friend Sayaka on her walk to school. Much of the school day is like any other, even with the arrival of Homura, a new student who is quite mysterious and has a knack for the whole school thing. However, this all changes when Madoka comes in contact with a cute cat-bunny named Kyuubey, who gives them the opportunity to become a magical girl. Homura crosses their path, and insists that she Madoka gives up the cat, insisting that she doesn’t know what she is getting into. Though, knowing Madoka, she is sympathetic towards the bunny-cat and carries it away with her best friend Sayaka. While doing so, she comes in contact with another girl, Mami, who goes along with the girls’ wishes to save the animal. Much of the story from this point on considers the dilemma of the responsibility of becoming a magical girl, whether it shall be a conscious decision or fate alone.In addition to its school setting, there is also another world with a dark atmosphere that the girls find themselves in. A large section of the trance-like world has the same same eerie feeling as the school setting, but in every other aspect of its design, it is way more pleasing to the eyes. Its dreamlike atmosphere could also manifest itself as another definition of dream, that being a passion. Much of it would be like a father telling her daughter “you can be anything if you put mind to it.” What these girls do shouldn’t be completely unexpected, after all Madoka hopes to uphold this cultural notion of “goodness.” Goodness is just as dreamlike as any other concept that isn’t physically present. While not tangible, there’s a reason why goals and dreams are largely interchangeable due to their characteristics of being highly idealized and sought after. To fulfill this sort of “dream,” Madoka undergoes psychological distress for a good chunk of the entire series. Now this isn’t to say she did for the entire series, not at all. Quite frankly, for a show that emphasize suffering so much it couldn’t have been any more apparent that its ending was pretty predictable. Nonetheless, its ending made me good tired and weird sort of way, even for a brief moment.The entire genre of mahou shoujo and its premise feels quite limiting given its typical target audience. Mahou shoujo is primarily based on the concept of femininity. The characters in these shows would be dressed in a manner that would pertain to what a female youth would desire to wear. More of this would gear towards more fictional aspects such as princesses. There are other themes present in mahou shoujo that would appeal to the general shounen demographic as well. A prime example of this would be a general concept of a fighter force consisting of morally righteous characters fighting against evil. The protagonist in both of these instances would be largely two dimensional, ideally so these youths could “self-insert” themselves as the protagonist. These concepts would help these youths follow society’s values, encouraging these youths to perpetually propagate them. Madoka Magica seems to stick with the premise of mahou shoujo wonderfully.A lot of the evil present was included for the sake of having something for the magical girls to fight. Well, something had to be clearly defined, so the witches are a good example of this evil. They are neither the witches from western animation or anime. Instead, they are more so supernatural entities. It was a strange name choice, not the usual expectation of cute girls wearing hats.Madoka Kaname makes the perfect magical girl and an all around good protagonist for a few reasons. Firstly, she is shown to follow the cultural notions of femininity. This is emphasized well with her strengths and weaknesses as a character. Madoka is shown to be a rather selfless and sweet girl that likes to help others. That’s a strength, there’s nothing wrong with that, even without its cultural association, helping people is a feel-good thing. Helping people is selfish, in the way that is something typically seen as a selfless duty in turn gives people an opportunity to get an ego boost. Madoka does not see the nature of helping people like this at all, since she is a self-sacrificing character. Much of her weakness as a character stems from her view that she sees herself as unable to help everybody, and is thus uninteresting. She neglects herself in a pursuit to selflessly help others. She is the type of character who sees herself as one who fulfills the roles of a magical girl rather than her own person, and is thus overwhelmed by the responsibility needed to appear as a role model. Madoka improves a lot as a character, and without going into major spoilers, makes more “logical” and egoistic decisions towards the end of the series while still having largely the same personality she had in the first episode. If fate had a strong presence it would be assumed that she was “destined” to be a magical girl.Madoka Magica has a small selection of characters, only five, with all of them having distinct personalities and reasons for why they decided to become magical girls. The rest of the girls have more resemblances of personality, only because the lack of personality is one of Madoka’s weaknesses as a character. For example, her best friend Sayaka reflects a lot of Madoka’s benevolent personality traits in their happy-go-lucky friendship. She has the same heroic personality as Madoka, though less of a push is required for her decision making due to her being more assertive. A lot of the story and their character development is dependent on making them suffer. The story tends to rely on this, so feeling attached towards the characters is difficult when they suffer, since there is not much buildup. So, I wouldn’t really consider it as out right character development, but its much more like a new outlook on the situations that tend to come. A lot of their character development is just the delayed forming of their inevitable friendship. Kyouko, the pocky stick eating DDR girl, had the biggest change throughout the series. On the other hand, Mami was initially accepting of the girls from day one, so I didn’t really sense any strong change from her.Kyuubey is cute, but utterly ominous. There was this one scene where he rolled over just like a cat, all I wanted to do was reach my hand through the screen and scratch their belly. Several close up shots on him depict nothing more than two beads for eyes and a squiggle for a mouth. Kyubey makes the perfect animal mascot, but do not be mistaken, there is much more to it than the outwardly appearance. Kyubey is known as the animal who negotiates contracts with the magical girls. Despite practically being a demigod, Kyubey sees their role as necessary and sees great potential in Madoka and Sayaka. Kyubey has a hard time understanding humans, and their only similarity they seem to share is their ability to communicate using language. Kyubey’s reasoning for making contracts for the girls was a bit humorous given their robotic nature compared to the rest of the girls.Kyubey kind of does whatever is most convenient do him, and he is highly efficient in doing so. They don't hold the same values as humans, which may explain his atypical behavior, so his choice of recruits could reflect this. If it weren’t obvious already, Madoka Magica has no notable male characters. Well, “mahou shoujo” directly translates to magical girl. A simple answer to a question like that is no fun, so I contend Madoka Magica’s absence of magical boys as beneficial.Society promotes the idea that boys should be less outwardly emotional than girls. A lot of this is encouraged by adults, but more so through peers teasing each other. This could be due to a deterrence towards following directions or listening to authority figures which leads them to behave in a manner more similar to their peers. Besides the natural tendency towards violence, this could explain why most terrorists are male, domestic terrorists act in a similar way to their peers even more so. Whether the teasing is in moderation depends on the context, in certain scenarios it may be deemed necessary to keep their fellow ""bro"" out of a locker. In more extreme scenarios, bullies were essentially big meanies that enforced normalcy, so that men a status below them could be prepared for future terminal brain damage. A lot of this behavior is brushed off under the notion that “boys will be boys,” which is usually encouraged by their mothers, who tend to fancy status. Kyubey shares the personality trait of being less outwardly emotional, as how a boy is expected so act. This could lead Kyubey could overlook boys in an attempt to understand girls more.Girls have more of an expectation to look presentable, which would fit mahou shoujo’s transformation elements better. Men are also more typically shamed for the type of clothing they wear which is why menswear is quite boring. They typically don’t preen themselves as a mouse would. A combination of the cultural aspects of beauty and a biological tendency for women to be more selective when it comes to pair-bonding relegates them as status symbols. Throughout history these were referred to as trophy wives, their only merit being their appearance. A lot of Madoka Magica’s themes tend to center on this sort of breaking point. For one, emotionality is gendered. Women tend to score lower on conscientiousness and higher on agreeableness. These traits can lead people to be more altruistic and give in to other people’s desires more easily. Boys are also physically stronger, so magical powers are this sort of chance for the girls to feel powerful in a way they couldn’t before. Besides the previous considerations, perhaps Kyubey just wanted some eye candy, just saying.One criteria I like to judge things on would be a comparison to what I consider as average. Madoka Magica’s strong point was undoubtedly its art, both visually and auditorially, which breaks the feeling of sameness in every conceivable way. Madoka Magica had a large focus on its cute artstyle without becoming excessive. The first thing people tend to focus on when communicating with other people are their eyes. So, as a small quirk, the characters’ eyes featuring these small diagonal black lines that made the eyes look like lightly scratched marbles were pleasing to my unscratched marbles. They also give the appearance of a shadow, which was a nice alternative compared to the stereotypically buggy anime eyes. Besides the eyes, the main thing to look forward to were its transformation scenes. After a quick design upgrade, the scenes where these girls fought witches had a neat avant-garde feel to it. Madoka Magica’s artistic elements come across as a combination between childhood drawings and a light drug trip. The story is comparable to a lot of its music in a sense that they both have a mysterious melancholic feel to it. I’d even consider the music to be better than the art, since it just fits in so well. Madoka Magica’s quick change of tone was quite the shock.In conclusion, Madoka Magica worked well with what it was given. Disregarding its hook, a lot of the story fell short and was a bit of a let down. The fast pacing of it didn't help, which strifed some opportunity for character development. A lot of the elements in mahou shoujo appeal to youths, so its concepts would have to be simple to remain in the realm of mahou shoujo. This could include the themes on friendship or femininity which is why most of the story’s development was basically the girls warming up to each other. Most of the themes were conveyed well by a really sweet and likable protagonist named Madoka. Along with her friend group, she has the opportunity to face the world by becoming a magical girl. whether it be by fate or destiny. Thankfully, there weren’t any themes about her abandoning her femininity or whatever. Kyubey is the star of the show, he practically upholds everything, which could lead to the anticulturists detestment of such a being. The art was honestly the best aspect about Madoka Magica, which is unique but sadly overshadowed by a lot of the plot. Overwall, Madoka Magica’s good execution for its genre was made even better by the amount of fluff it had, which made it feel like a glorified CGDCT at times."
"Saikyou no Shienshoku ""Wajutsushi"" de Aru Ore wa Sekai Saikyou Clan wo Shitagaeru","I was reading the plot some time ago, when planning what to watch this season. But is seems like not worth it.Today which is Tuesday and i did not have new episode to watch, i was like let’s give it a try to this anime because it was on the top in anime9. So i have started and anime was on episode 10. After first episode i get so addicted to it. I could not stop.The anime is fantastic for me, it gives me a similar vibe to Blue lock, waiting to see what will be next. With similar to me egotistical vibe, and...strive for the best.I like mc, bad but in charismatic way, with sarcasm and to the point. For sure bad mouth but i like it a lot. One of the few anime, which makes me crave for another episode."
One Piece,"One Piece is good as a comedy but pretty terrible at most other things. Besides the atrocious amount of filler, the pacing is atrocious and its serious stories are lackluster. The correct way to somewhat enjoy One Piece is to just take it as an infinite adventure with a pretty likeable cast. Also, this review is based on the assumption that you watch One Pace. The original One Piece is a 2/10 due to its pacing and filler.The irony is that even in One Pace, the show still moves way too slow. It goes from Luffy swinging a punch for 5 minutes to Luffy swinging...a punch for 1 minute. The original also has a lot of moments where people just stare at each other for full minutes doing nothing. This is because the studio caught up with the manga so they have to waste the viewers' time as they release an episode every week.Its strength lies in a colorful and interesting cast which makes the show really funny. There is a big variety of personalities with a fair bit of depth to them. The interactions between this vast variety of personalities never fails to deliver really funny moments. This might me one of the few animes that made me laugh out loud.However, One Piece will sometimes butcher its own characters. Sanji was funny when he was obsessed with women but tried to approach them romantically in a classy way. It started being unfunny when it's just him nosebleeding every time he sees a woman. Brooks was funny when his character was someone who looked classy and spoke politely, but would randomly do crude things such as fart or burp out loud. He stopped being funny when his only line became ""Can I see your panties?"" Zoro was funny when his dead serious persona was broken with stupid actions. Him getting lost every time isn't funny. It really is a shame because they are already hilarious and likeable. The gags just leave a sour taste.The theme of freedom in One Piece is pretty fun and interesting. It's about a group of friends setting sail and chasing their dreams. It makes for a fun show because it's a story about enjoying yourself freely and going on an adventure. These are the moments where One Piece shines. It is the whimsical spirit of adventure. In fact, I would even say that One Piece is more enjoyable in its intermission, low stakes episodes between arcs rather than during the actual arcs.There are some very good serious moments such as the Marineford Arc or Katakuri vs Luffy. However, these are exceptions and One Piece is usually horrible whenever it tries to be serious. The best example is the drawn out conclusion to the recent Wano Arc where Luffy became one of those ""serious protagonists"" instead of his usual whimsical adventure-loving self. It just stopped being interesting to watch at that point.The superpowers themselves are also pretty interesting. There isn't one single power system and different characters are strong in different ways. For example, Sanji, Zoro and Luffy pretty much have physical strength as their core strength. Yes Luffy can stretch, but the reason he beats up baddies is because he packs a punch not because he's rubber. Chopper powers up through medical knowledge. Usopp, Nami and Franky power up through technology. Robin and Brooks power up through their in-build devil fruit powers. There's an interesting variety in how the characters get stronger and it's pretty fun to watch."
Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"I will make a short review of this anime since it is still ongoing for now.I am bothered by the age gap, honestly. Japan doesnt hold back by its love for lolicons, no? *sigh*This anime has potential at least minus the age gap of the FL and ML. Though it looks like there is no romantic (sexual) attraction at play since the FL is just with the ML because of circumstances and the ML is an immature emperor who just receive any kind of love given to him. I am just bothered by his preferences of much much younger than him.Other than that,...its a generic Time travel-enemies to lovers-troupe of anime. You may or may not enjoy it. But honestly, i have mixed feelings for it.If you are into this kind of troupe, HUGE age gap/LOLICON protagonists + with the element of time travel/2nd chance + Enemies to lovers, then you may want to give this a try.*I may change my rating of this anime once its finished. but now its a 5-6/10 for me"
Jujutsu Kaisen,"The first season of Jujutsi Kaisen is mediocre, but it is necessary to be able to understand the second season which is a masterpiece. The problems of season 1 leak into season 2 like a chronic illness that doesn't go away. However, season 2 is worth it because it has a much more exciting plot and animation which completely make up for its issues.Jujutsu Kaisen (JJK) is a shonen anime that has many very convoluted mechanics which never get adequately explained. But when it does explain something, you get even more confused. It's not satisfied with telling you that Doodoohead shoots balls of fire. It...has to tell you where the flammable material comes from, how the combustion reaction is, what is the entropy, the effects of weather on the superpower, climate change, etc. Gojo's power is that nothing can reach him, but instead it constantly goes on this tangent about Zenos' paradoxes or Achilles and the turtle. Frankly, nobody cares.There are also concepts lifted from other shonen which JJK never tries to fit in its own universe. For example, the concept of power contracts which was lifted from HxH. In HxH, Aura comes from willpower. A user can impose restrictions on himself as a testament to his willpower which makes their abilities stronger. For example, ""I will explain my ability to anyone I see"" which in turn makes you stronger. In JJK, this concept is lifted, never explained, but also cursed energy does not come from willpower in the first place. As a result, the whole concept just sort of exists and is weakly justified, not that JJK makes any serious attempt to explain all of this. It just vaguely mentions something about ""contracts"" and you're supposed to have watched HxH as homework.Every thing in JJK has been seen before. Evil spirit sealed in MC? Edgy rival? Humorous but strong teacher? That's all Naruto. Power contracts? HxH. Domains? Yu Yu Hakusho. Last moments of a dead parent as a motive? Blue Exorcist. While I don't mind copying stuff from other shows, I do expect a reason to watch this, such as a unique way of arranging these concepts or a twist. However, season 1 doesn't really have anything special about it. Therefore, it's just mediocre on its own."
"Tsuma, Shougakusei ni Naru.","At first I thought this is weird asf and it's just another way to rationalize pdf by those japanese but NO, no shit , this anime is much more than that, it's about 人間関係 (human interactions), family, the ways we cope with grief and loss, and moving forward. It's a serious drama dealing with these themes, not a show that sexualizes underaged children (I just admit that I was drawn into this by that expectation tho). One wonderful thing about this show is how much character development the main cast went through throughout each episode, how they became another human beings at the end of...the show. It's just beautiful. The ending song was hella emotional too. Somehow this show kinda reminds me of Onani Master Kurosawa (yes, a manga about a dude masturbating in women toilet everyday). They all got weird at first but turned out to be well-written works about human interactions. Also reminds me of Silent Hill 2 (just finished the remake version) in terms of how husbands accept their wives' death and move forward. Anyway you might want to sit through the first few episodes to witness some real development in the later half of the show, starting from the girl's new mother to her old husband and daughter (even the daughter's bf who got over his ex's death). Pretty solid anime. 8/10."
Byousoku 5 Centimeter,"Gaaaah! What’s the point!!!Love hurts, we get it.Love doesn’t always work out, we get it.I didn’t need to sit through an utterly boring and uneventful hour to be told something I’ve seen a million times done in much more important and better ways.Inconsistent themes, bland characters, and dialogue that is straight out of a bad soap opera.At least it’s pretty…...Shinkai has gotten much better at realizing how important characters are, with each new work he seems to prioritize them even more than the previous one. Takaki is a blank slate. Akari doesn't have enough screen time to matter. Unironically I think Sanae might be the only character I found myself caring about, just because she had motivations and emotions. Takaki shows nothing and it's not mysterious or accurate it's just a cheap way to write a story."
God Eater,"Adapted from a video game, God Eater stands out among its peers with its promising premise and unique approach. While many anime adaptations of games fall short, this one manages to hold its ground, offering a visually striking experience and engaging characters.The animation, often a point of contention among viewers, is one of God Eater's strongest assets in my opinion. Its bold art style and dynamic action scenes may not appeal to everyone, but they effectively set the tone for its grim, post-apocalyptic world. The characters are another highlight, each given enough background and development to feel relevant, especially given the anime's relatively short runtime.However,...where God Eater falters is its story. Initially, the premise feels familiar yet intriguing, delivering a solid post-apocalyptic narrative with high-stakes action. Unfortunately, after episode 7, the story becomes increasingly predictable, losing its initial spark. For those well-versed in similar anime or video games, the plot twists and developments are easy to anticipate, making the latter half of the series less compelling.Overall, I’d give God Eater a solid 6/10. It’s a decent choice for a weekend binge, particularly if you enjoy post-apocalyptic settings or are a fan of the game. While it may not break new ground, it offers enough entertainment to pass the time—just don't expect it to leave a lasting impression."
Gokicha!!,"Exactly as expected, two roach girls in a city. All expectations met. It's not fantastical or heartwarming or breaking, it's short and sweet an I love that for it.The animation would be ass for a story with substance, but it's just complex enough to get the point across and no more. In the end, the 4 I expected was actually a 5 but that's it.There is no overarching story with a conclusion and all, and the substories immediately get repetitive at a point wherein the joke of cockroaches being beaten gets told again and again.There is no sort of character development whatsoever, the story ventures...no farther than establishing the traits to poke fun of and then doing so.Ergo, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, ever. It's not quite out of hate, there's simply not much to like past the designs. Perhaps a toddler would think it's funny for a good minute."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online II,"For SAO lovers I'd recommend this. There's a lot of risque material. In both the openings+endings but the soundtracks are amazing and well done.I hope we can better understand the game Gun gale and not focus so much on their rivalry. It seems more possibilities have been included this go around. Also not a big fan of the lewdness involved with the smaller staff. It's alarming to say the least. We need a stake or critical moment outside of a game world. Where the characters endure a greater challenge. The emotions are spread out and there's nothing alluding to how the story climaxes. Or even...began for that matter. We jump straight into a tourney.Here's to hoping Season 3 or Sword Art Online never follows this formula again.Graphics 10/10Music 10/10Story/Characters mehPlease give us a story or promote a game instead of doing these ludicrous stand offs with the cast. It's breaking a lot of rules. Taking the charm and wholesomeness away from the ""mystery"" which I feel is still there. Given us the introductions and revealing more of their real world experiences.There's still much more we can learn and enjoy about this series."
Sonny Boy,"I just finished watching this anime and was compelled to write a review about it. This is my first time writing a review so please bear with me. This anime has a very surreal style of storytelling. It follows the main character Nagara, and the people he forms friendships with. Nagara is a self-loathing loner, who is disinterested in life, thinks very low of himself. He doesn't want to try making things better or put in the effort, because he doesn't believe he is capable. If anyone planning to watch this anime has ever resonated with that feeling, I am sure you will be able...to connect with this anime.Through the course of the events that take place, Nagara becomes close with Nozomi, one of the main female characters. Nozomi is the complete opposite of Nagara. She is earnest, caring and she always sees the hope, the light in any situation. With the help of Nozomi, as well as other friends that Nagara makes - Mizuho and Rajdhani - Nagara learns to come out of his shell, both figuratively, and in the case of this anime literally.I should address something about surrealism. Because this anime is presented in such a surrealist and artsy way, a lot of people might come away thinking that it is too pretentious. I want to say, please do not gatekeep yourselves from an art experience like that. You don't have to understand every single little thing that happened in the show. I am not going to pretend I understood everything that happened either. I think what is important when consuming a piece of media that leans so much into absurdity like this, is to focus on the emotions it makes you feel. Do not try to dissect every scene to understand the deeper meaning behind it, like it's a book report you need to write. Just feel the feels. If the characters' experiences resonate with you, I am sure you will enjoy the experience of watching this anime.Art style and animation wise, this anime is immaculate. I love the scenes that are drawn like they were done in crayons. It really adds to the surreal atmosphere. There are many different unique worlds explored that make the whole show feel like a animated collage. I really loved it.I am not the biggest appreciator of music. The show felt like it had little music, but when it did, it was very fitting. Lowkey, slow and somber is how I would describe it.Overall, I think this might be my new favorite show, 10/10. I understand if it isn't everyone's cup of tea, but please give it a try and don't dismiss it for being too pretentious."
"Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou, Aruiwa Sekai ga Hajimaru Seisen","General advice: Don’t watch this.A) WRITING: 10/501. Story (7/15)A extremely generic story. Two big (magic) factions that are in war and want to win, also there are neutral cities because of (they don't explain it), then we have the average, common, generic, overused, and boring romeo and juliet story. But it’s not that bad if you are okay with the generic and predictable stuff. The problem comes when we have a mediocre stroy and both a bad plot and horrible characters.2. Plot  (3/15)Kirito clone meets blonde girl with a big chest, they are mortal enemies but after two minutes they're not, after that they...keep bumping into each other (Deus ex machina to the extreme), after the start there aren't any noticeable events in the whole story, and thanks to this I dropped after episode 8.3. Characters (0/20)Pure generic trash, the male mc is kirito from sao, the girl mc is a copy paste of the male mc, (basically kirito but fused with a tsundere) but its blonde and also has a big chest. All the mc Friends are generic trash, but that's not the worst part, because then we have the ""squad Captain"" also known as Mismis, this is the most incompetent and annoying character that I have encountered in an anime so far, and it’s also the reason of the 0 in this category.ANIMATION: 14/304. Art (10/20)Its fine I guess, nothing bad, but also nothing good.5. Sound (4/10)Not a single good song, sound effects are ok.PERSONAL: 4/206. Quality Consistency (0/5)There is quality consistency but just because all episodes are bad. Lemme rewrite it; there is consistency in bad episodes, but there isn’t any quality, so another 0.8. Episodes watched (3/5)I was able to watch until episode 8, I couldn’t take it anymore so I had to drop off.9. Enjoyment (1/10)I hated this, but I have to admit that I somehow enjoyed episode 1 (probably just because It was a new show and I was expecting it to get better) so it gets a 1.FS) FINAL SCORE: 28/100This might have some decent moments, but as a lover of romance anime, I can’t recommend this."
Tengoku Daimakyou,"Heavenly Delusion is a great show, It is a bit slow at first, but if you watch it untill the end you won't be dissapointed. Here goes my review:A) WRITING:  46/501. Story (15/15)This anime has a good story, and with good I mean great, there are a lot of mysteries and instead of one we have 2 stories, this anime has 2 main main characters (the girl mc, and the boy mc) + a lot of side characters that act like one mc for the other story. Another cool part is the fact that at the end of season 1 almost any of the...mysteries get directly clarified, but if you pay attention you will discover a lot of things, there are some extra things that I would love to point out, but I will have to avoid it since I would end up spoiling something.2. Plot  (13/15)Again, instead of having one plot we have two, the first plot (the one about the 2 mc) it’s the most interesting one for me; since the other plot doesn’t start really cooking until the final episodes. The first plot is the only one that has action and exploration while the second one focuses more on the actual story. The two plots (even if not connected) compliment each other very well. The only “problem” could be the firsts episodes, I felt a bit bored at first but just because the story didn’t kick in until later, meanwhile the second plot felt interesting from the start. In conclusion, this show has a great but not amazing plot.3. Characters (18/20)There isn’t a single bad/annoying character in this show, both MCs feel great, and it’s the same with all the side characters. But there aren’t any amazing characters.B) ANIMATION: 30/304. Art (20/20)Amazing art, both backgrounds and animations are amazing.5. Sound (10/10)The sound design is solid, there are no flaws, and the intro song is a banger.C) PERSONAL: 19/206. Quality Consistency (5/5)There isn’t a single bad episode in the whole series.8. Episodes watched (5/5)I watched the whole thing.9. Enjoyment (9/10)This show is very enjoyable, can't wait for a second season.FINAL SCORE: 94/100"
Tonari no Ie no Anette-san The Animation,"Review of Tonari no Ie no Anette-san The AnimationTonari no Ie no Anette-san The Animation is an adult anime adaptation of a popular doujinshi manga. It falls under the genres of romance, drama, and erotica. The story centers on the relationship between a young man and his alluring neighbor, Anette, who exudes a mature charm that captivates the protagonist.Story and CharactersThe plot is relatively straightforward, focusing on the dynamics between the two main characters, with their interactions ranging from awkward and sweet to intensely passionate. While the simplicity of the storyline allows viewers to focus on the chemistry between the leads, it does lack depth...and broader context. Anette is portrayed as a confident and seductive woman, while the protagonist embodies a shy yet curious individual, making for a classic but effective pairing.Art and AnimationThe animation quality is decent for the genre, with fluid character movements and attention to detail in expressions and intimate scenes. The character designs stay true to the source material, capturing Anette's elegance and the protagonist's youthful energy. However, background art is minimalistic, which might make the world feel a bit lifeless at times.Sound and Voice ActingThe voice acting stands out as a highlight, with the performers delivering convincing emotions that enhance the intimacy of the scenes. The sound design complements the mood, with a subdued soundtrack that doesn’t distract from the dialogue or action.Themes and AppealAs a work of adult anime, Tonari no Ie no Anette-san primarily caters to fans of the genre who appreciate mature themes and sensual storytelling. Its focus on building tension and chemistry between the leads makes it engaging, though it might not appeal to those looking for a more plot-driven experience.Overall ImpressionTonari no Ie no Anette-san The Animation delivers what fans of the genre expect—a combination of alluring characters and intense moments. While its narrative depth is limited, the series fulfills its purpose as a sensual, character-driven anime. It is recommended for mature audiences seeking an entertaining yet straightforward adult anime.Rating: 7/10A solid entry in the adult anime category, with good character chemistry and quality production values."
Xian Wang de Richang Shenghuo,"“The Daily Life of The Immortal King” this title describes the anime perfectly, it walks you through the main protagonist’s daily life and it is Boring!Starting with what was good about this series. The animation, Haoliners Animation pulled out all the stops on some of the scenes. Most of the anime looks really good. The action is really smooth and the visuals are incredible. It was pretty much the only thing that got me to power through.The story is not interesting in the slightest, it starts by introducing this massively overpowered character and then proceeds to follow him around whilst he holds back his power...and keeps it a secret from everyone else he meets. None of the characters have any depth and because of this half the series is just the writers jumping back and forward into the overly rushed backstories. The comedy is massively forced, and it feels like almost every character attempts some form of comic relief at some point in the anime.The plot felt pointless, there were some problems that could’ve been solved in a much quicker and easier way that it was painful to watch the characters taking it a really long round-a-bout way to achieve the same outcome and that’s just not enjoyable.The sound and music choices for the anime were okay, nothing really stood out but that’s also nothing to complain about. I suppose in a way that fit with the theme of this series.While I didn’t enjoy the story. I can’t deny the interesting world building of this anime. The fantasy and mythology side of it was what kept me watching, spiritual swords, demons and cultivation powers. That’s the difference that the Chinese anime brings to the table and it was slightly entertaining. But not enough to get more than a score of 3 out of me and I was not convinced to watch the second season."
"Sayounara Ryuusei, Konnichiwa Jinsei","Just an as average as it can be anime (maybe lower) with cliche Wholesome story, and no epic moments that I expected and it foreshadowed, a bit surprising in a few storylines but not something memorable or you would ever regret missing out on. Art seems fine but animation looked clunky to me and could've been a lot better, watching the fight scenes could make you realize how much work the animation needs.The story isn't overall unique that any average anime fan could tell, pretty predictable but ig the wholesomeness is sweet, though there's one decision about ""drinking"" in the village the MC lives that...baffles me which seems like a fetish insert for the author and inappropriate, maybe highly inappropriate.The art style is fitting for the story and got no major complaints there, just the execution and optimization could be a bit better as it seems like they tried to copy the manga as much as possible.No characters are much interesting, especially the MC's character is so booring and honestly kinda pathetic. Don't expect a cool MC or characters (as it is the case for the story, it isn't ""cool"").However, in case of characters,among all my characters, the first villain, a woman witch with purple hair was fairly built and was a bit interesting seeing her backstory, flashbacks and ideology.I would maybe recommend it even if you have nothing else to watch and just want to watch a wholesome happy-go-lucky generic anime.I myself dropped it as the pace became slower and slower with each episode and got bored of how I felt I never missed anything out even if i skipped to a randome minute of each next episode.Peace."
"""Oshi no Ko"" 2nd Season","I went into this anime with zero expectations, but it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The story is engaging, and the characters are well-developed. Even without reading the manga, I can already sense a promising evolution in the two protagonists, both mentally and emotionally. I confess that, at times, the protagonists can be irritating, but this might be intentional, as it adds depth and realism to their personalities.The premise of show business and the chaos in the lives of celebrities offers an interesting and thoughtful perspective. As the saying goes, “never meet your heroes,” and this anime captures that sentiment beautifully.The story is,...of course, unique.The art is good, though not particularly groundbreaking.If you're looking for an anime with a strong narrative and compelling character arcs, this one won’t disappoint."
Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 2nd Season Part 2,"The pacing is bad. It is extremely slow; the story barely crawls forward. This fact is mostly due to how bad the dialogue is unfortunately.There is way too much dialogue and it hurts the pacing real bad; there are scenes with twice as much dialogue as needed.Less is more, and the same is true for dialogue; a good writer should strive to tell his or her story with just the right amount of words. There is no need to insult the viewers' intellects by spelling out everything happening on screen.Besides this, the show is good. There are some other problematic elements: The occasional voice and...animation desync, a lot of flashbacks, characters acting in cartoonish ways, and some dumb op abilities.And there are some good elements: Nice animation, cool premise, interesting messages, and a good mix of hope and despair as the main themes of the story.Overall, bad dialogue is the main problem of Re:Zero and it is not going anywhere."
"Saikyou no Shienshoku ""Wajutsushi"" de Aru Ore wa Sekai Saikyou Clan wo Shitagaeru","this anime is truly underrated, children think that mc is cruel but they don't know how world works. this is not where the mc is the strongest in the world but he is smart. he has been told that hardwork can never beat inborn talent but he still works hard. he shows others the reality of world. he is kind but does not shows it. the animation is improved in episode 10. characters have well written back stories and depth in them. children will never enjoy this anime. he is a anti hero type mc like light who will do whatever it takes to accomplish...his goal. overall i can say that this anime is my favourite of this fall season."
Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai,"At the moment of writing this review, Shimoneta is almost at its 10th anniversary. One would expect that since then, some of the attitudes towards sexuality and vulgarity this show criticized would have gotten better. Truth is, with the spread of more outwardly sexual material this last decade, not only coming from the anime industry but from media in general, some have stayed the same, while some others have gotten even worse.Shimoneta is not only a show about funny sex jokes being thrown at your face every five minutes or so, it contains a message about sexuality, the ways society interacts with it and the...unintended consequences of being overtly moralistic and protective about it can have on those that actually need sex education the most: young people. A message that has only gotten more and more relevant the more time it passes by. Those who cannot see past this show's more risqué aspects and take it as only the ""discount quasi-hentai of the season"" could not be more mistaken.As for the anime itself: it's your run of the mill superhero show, but instead of fighting some evil organization (well, they sorta do at some point, lol) the protagonists are hell-bent on committing wicked and perverted acts upon the general public as a way to ""teach them about sex"". If you are merely here for the awkwardness and ridicule of the whole situation, then you might enjoy Shimoneta quite a bit, since this series doesn't lack in neither of the two aspects, specially as the anime progresses towards its last episodes. If you aren't into sex jokes that much, then I would recommend staying for the overall message, although the show could get a bit overwhelming for you at times in more than one occasion.In conclusion: while Shimoneta might not be a show for everyone, its message resonates true more than ever and its an important watch for both people that enjoy ecchi and are concerned about the increasing censorship on anime media we are seeing these days. Even if its only for having a good time, disconnect your brain, and not think too hard over what you are watching, you will enjoy it."
InuYasha,"Honestly, I don’t get why some people dislike InuYasha. For me, it’s hands down one of the best anime ever.First off, the world-building is just incredible. It strikes this perfect balance between the modern era and the Sengoku period, creating a setting that feels rich, alive, and full of history. It’s like you’re stepping into a different world every time, and yet it all fits together so well. (10/10)Then there’s the character development, which is top-notch. Remember InuYasha at the start? He’s this rude, closed-off jerk who barely cares about anyone. But as the story unfolds, especially with Kagome around, he starts to change. You...get to see his softer, more vulnerable side, and it’s so satisfying to watch. Even his sword, Tessaiga, evolves alongside him, which adds a cool layer to his journey. (10/10)Now, about the fights—while they’re not the show’s main focus, they’re still fun to watch. Sure, the animation might not hold up against today’s standards, but the battles still manage to draw you in. They’re more about the story and character dynamics than flashy moves, which works for me. (7/10)And let’s not forget Naraku, the big bad of the series. He’s a genius when it comes to manipulation and scheming. His plans are so intricate that you can’t help but admire the guy’s villainous creativity. That said, he sometimes underestimates his enemies, which leads to some great twists. He’s one of those villains you love to hate, and he totally earns his spot as a top-tier antagonist. (9/10)Overall, InuYasha is a gem, even if it doesn’t always get the love it deserves. Maybe newer fans who are into fast-paced action and nonstop fights don’t see its charm. But for anyone willing to dive deeper, it offers so much more with its themes, relationships, and character growth.Fun fact: InuYasha won several awards during its run and was a big hit in the early 2000s, proving just how much of a lasting impact it’s had."
Dandadan,"Dandadan is a product. It is fast food entertainment. And there is nothing wrong with that. What infuriates me is when people try to sell it for bigger than it is. There is nothing deep about dandandan. The storyline is predictable. The characters are shallow. It is like a Marvel movie. Nothing wrong with that, I like some Marvel movies but when I watch them I know they are garbage.Dandadan is a guilty pleasure show carried by animation. It will only impress teenagers. Adults can enjoy it too but as a popcorn time waster. What makes me disappointed is the lack of guts of...the author. You can tell he wrote this story to be popular instead of writing a compelling narrative. I can't blame him, he needs to survive and compelling stories is not what the mainstream wants.This is why garbage like edgelord Joker and mediocre Avengers are exploding the box office. The author is smart and follows the law of the market.That is why I despise dandadan. It is giving people what they want, it is not challenging them in anyway. I hate when a story gives me what I want. This is why my favorite stories are stories who made me feel negative emotions, where the authors took risks. Dandadan took no risks and deserves no hatred or praise, just indifference.It will end up like Jujustsu kaisen in the few years, another product of hype forgotten now because that is all Dandadan is, an anime from the assembly line.Next Season, there is another anime from the same mold Sakamoto days ready to replace it because there is nothing intriguing about these shows. They are consumed like Macdonald. Again, I eat Macdonald from time to time but you won't see me tout it as great food. Same with Dandadan. You can enjoy it but stop the hyperbole with this mediocre show."
Dandadan,"I think this anime had potential to be good, but alas the creators decided to ruin it with the great amount of unnecessary fanservice that makes you question what's the plot and does it even have one.If I had to take a sip from an alcoholic drink every time there was an unnecessary oversexualized scene where they show a literal high schooler half-naked/naked just for fanservice or comedic relief, my liver would get so rotten that even a health potion wouldn't be able to save me from certain death :)People might say it's funny, but if you ask me it's very boring and I've long...lost the feeling of enjoyment while watching it.If you want to watch an actually funny anime from this season, then go watch ""A Terrified Teacher at Ghoul School"", cus Dandadan ain't it...sorry"
Madogiwa no Totto-chan,"What kind of school will be the next school. - teachers: love for their student';but all that disappeared when the world war swept them awayOh, I mean, how could we gain knowledge in that era. even if you wanted to live a peaceful life u can't.how bad the impact of world war was.Madogiwa no Totto is a rollercoaster of emotions throughout the duration that I enjoyed until the end — Taking place in Tokyo during World War - II, it combines development learning with fun, freedom and love. However the main point is not only quite there, very wide. this story is a transition incident.all...the supporting characters were created to be truly very expressive, including the main one.Moon, stars, spark, trains uhhh it feels like entering a child's mind. If you know the artwork ""Giovanni no Shima"" is a beautiful film about dreams, hope and love. also 'Galactic Railroad' not only colors the life of the storyline, but also the appearance of the film. Like the film as a whole, the dreams are beautifully animated. Imagination will be played here. what a beautiful combination.This is a show that I really recommend called 'Totto'. Yes, I will also save this show for the future and enjoy it with my children, why not? Such small children are taught how important attitude and responsibility are. also the attitude of a spoiled and whiny child tends to be underestimated even though it is realistically normal like that. similar to ""Mirai no Mirai"" — Family TV shows,the atmosphere reminds me of ""Omoide Poroporo"".However, have you ever thought. What if you were born with a disability since when you were little? damn ... is fate fair?Madogiwa no Totto is a simple, straightforward and charming tale about what it means to be a parent, at the time educate and while the story and characters are presented in an ideal form, this doesn't really detract from one's enjoyment of the show. It goes without saying that anyone who has experience of raising children will be able to relate more readily to a number of the themes in the show, but it should be pointed out that the plot is simple enough to allow anyone to enjoy it.verdict; definitely worth watchingThank You"
"Komi-san wa, Comyushou desu.","A light-hearted and fun slice-to-life show wherein we can watch Komi, a seemingly reserved protagonist with a warm personality go through an interpersonal journey with the goal of creating 100 friends in high school. It's a very cute anime to watch especially if you're looking for something to lighten your mood.Animation (7/10) - Its on-par with the standards of a modern anime show; Nothing too special but its well-done nonetheless for what it is. There are glimpses of extra effort when it comes to detailing some scenes it wants to highlight especially on closeup and intimate ones but most of the times it doesn't deviate...onto anything special nor unacceptable, so... Nice.Storyline (7/10) - Its storyline pacing is on-par with its manga original apparently, and its very obvious as the show goes along; Its done in an episodic manner wherein it has a main continuity in terms of concept but a different focus and setting on each episodes it has. Which makes it really digestible especially for casual watchers.Soundtrack (7/10) - Its library is very suitable for its slice-of-life thematic — Made for easy-listening and just has very soothing vibes. Good to like play along maybe in a hotel lounge o maybe just your living room, outside of the show's context. But on the storyline's contexts it syncs decently on helping to portray certain moods and narrations.Overall - 7 out of 10"
Fumetsu no Anata e,"Melancholy. If I had to describe To Your Eternity in a word, that word would be melancholy. To call the storytelling powerful would be an understatement. But it isn't as simple as one word. Simply put, To Your Eternity is a masterclass in how to deliver an optimistic message about the beauty of life, but in a realistic and grounded way that never comes off as forced or artificial. Yoshitoki Ōima, who also wrote the award-winning ""A Silent Voice"", proves through this show that she is capable of writing some of the most compelling, deep, and emotional characters that anime fans, as well as myself,...have seen in a long time.To Your Eternity is an anime about the pursuit of life, the joy in discovery, and preservation for what we now have. Our journey begins with a nameless orb, a being who grows and evolves in reaction to their surroundings. First the orb becomes a rock, then moss, and eventually it comes into contact with a dying wolf who it then took on the appearance of. The wolf later comes into contact with a young unnamed boy, a person who would later become the orb's primary way of representing itself, something the orb can do by means of shapeshifting. There's a magical quality to all this, but despite how whimsical it can be, it somehow ends up feeling like something that could actually happen.From episode one, To Your Eternity makes it clear that there is going to be a lot of suffering. The featured white-haired boy's entire mission is  to make contact with his people, who had left the village long ago. And many times, he encounters signs that they might still be alive. These pings of hope invigorate a sense of optimism and steadfastness, yet at the same time, there's a remarkable sadness within him when faced with the potential reality that everyone he knows and loves might be dead by now. The orb is present for all of this as an observer, as are we, the audience.Part of what makes this show so enjoyable is that the viewer, as a presumably full-grown human being, already knows the struggles and trials that an experience on Earth as a human brings. There's even an expression for this: the ""human experience"". When something emotional in the show happens, naturally we have an emotional reaction because we can relate to it. But for a long time, the Orb doesn't understand how emotions work. Watching the orb slowly learn how to deal with complex emotions is deeply relatable to just about anyone. There's something inherently satisfying to watching the orb grow as a person, the same way you'd enjoy watching a flower in your room grow and blossom over time.For all intents, the orb basically starts off as a baby, and they have to learn everything one step at a time. And like raising a real child, there are moments of frustration, but these frustrations are very important for maintaining realism. The orb doesn't become a ""true human"" for a considerable amount of time, and while it's frustrating to watch the orb take so long to learn of concepts that I have personally known for decades, it also helps me to believe in the fiction as anything faster would have broken immersion.I'm going to do my best to avoid spoilers, just bear in mind that the orb eventually leaves the snowy tundra it came from and ventures into new areas. And that's where the show, in my opinion, really starts. From this point on, To Your Eternity becomes a show about people that the orb (later named ""Fushi"") meets and interacts with, as well as the various experiences they have together.When writing a story around an eternal character, there are lot of challenges the storyteller faces. How do you make the audience care about the life of a person who cannot die? To Your Eternity answers this question by threatening the lives of every single person Fushi interacts with on a regular basis. Monsters are attracted to Fushi for reasons unknown, and even with Fushi doing his best to defend himself and others, a great many people are killed by these aberrations.If handled with less precision this might feel contrived and forced, but here the characters Fushi meets are *really* well-written and compelling, so they end up being people you grow attached to and care about. This is one of the few anime I've watched in recent memory where I actually remembered the names of multiple characters because they left such a strong impact on me. March, Pioran, Gugu, Tonari, Hayase, and of course Fushi. Each of these characters (and more) are written with such remarkable realism that it's hard to imagine these ideas didn't come from a real person who had once had similar thoughts and dreams.I could go on about a great many things, but for the sake of this review I don't think specifics are too important. The main reason I find myself really enjoying this show, aside from what I've already written on it, is the unrelenting optimism embedded in the story's narrative. Fushi is given a singular purpose, to ""grow"". That is their entire being, their reason for living. But eventually they develop themself and begin to seek more. Growth is important, but equally important is what you *choose* to grow into, and you do have a choice. If you meet good people, you can learn from their ideals and become a better person yourself. I think there's a beauty in that, simple and obvious as it is, but it can become easy for people to forget these basic concepts in a world as fast and demanding as the one we find ourselves living in.In To Your Eternity, the main character continually grows into a better person from his experiences with both positive and negative people, and I find myself relating with this concept on a deep level. I'd like to think that, even though it's just one anime, To Your Eternity left an indelible mark on me, to where even if I'm not consciously thinking about it, I'm sure it's helped to shape me into an even better version of who I am today. The journey of life never stops; we're always learning, growing, and continuing to reach even higher than we did before. And to me, even though it was all imaginary, I think experiences like these are worth a lot, even if you can't immidiately see the payoff."
Seitokai Yakuindomo,"This anime ended-up being far tamer than what I expected.Seitokai Yakuindomo essentially is your run of the mill slice-of-life anime about the daily life of high-school boys and girls (more girls than boys, in this given this case) of the school's very own student council and all the antics that go associated with it. There are some sexual jokes thrown here and there, and sexual themes are prevalent all through this series given how intense they can become at times, but it definitively isn't the sex-obsessed crazed show I believed I was gonna get into when I started watching it.Now, at this point of the...review you may be asking yourself ""then, why did you then give this show such a high ranking provided it wasn't what you originally expected when first got into it?"" That's easy to answer: If it is true that this anime isn't as heavy-handed into sexual themes as one would think, it delivers a memorable set of characters who quickly grow on you the more time you spend watching it and puts them in an almost-episodic type of story-line where what was going on at the beginning of the chapter doesn't necessarily have to be what is going on at the end of it. This makes the overarching plot overall easy to follow, no matter on which episode you might picked it on.This anime is ideal for slice-of-life lovers who are also in need of a bit of ecchi in their life although they don't necessarily want those themes to be on their face as they would in animes like Shimoneta, for example. Give it a try, it might certainly not be a work of art, but it will get a laugh or two out of you and entertain you for a good while, at least it did for me."
Haigakura,"Here we have another interesting scoop, a mythology story of gods where we see some evil gods marrying to maintain the balance of the world. The construction of the world is solid. You may get confused in the first chapter about what the plot is about, but the description of the lore comes quickly and concisely and your doubts are dispelled. But since the plot is told, a serious novel fails to stand out in romance, action, jokes. The animation is very standard and the characters make the public not connect with the anime but with its source material, the manga.If you plan to see...it, don't be fooled by the handsome men and their few double-meaning jokes. There are also women, they are not many, and the romance that wants to build the plot is hetero, but it will seem to you that it is a burden for the construction of the plot and does not stand out since it is not the main theme of the plot, from what I see."
Yeosin Gangnim,"Do you like cute anime husbands? Do you like not-weird fan service? Are you a women? Well chances are you will very much enjoy this anime. I am unsure why this does not have a better rating especially in female communities.Honestly, the plot of this was quite good and I absolutely did not have any high expectations. This anime deserves a higher rating.Just to preface: I have never watched the K-Drama before, but I am currently watching. Thus far, it’s mostly accurate to it! It is as good as this anime, and the anime reflects its original roots well. I’m also very happy they...finished the English dub on Crunchy which is good for those who like sub and dub.Moreover, I recommend this to any Shojo anime lover out there! It’s so good that I am getting my gal pals to watch too!! I I’m also happy that this takes a more mature role, and it NOT fan-service for men! It does a good job portraying the story. This one is def for the ladies, as there are some very cute moments with the characters that is not weird! The Japanese and English voice actors were candy to my ears. Very pleasurable experience!! I think a lot of younger and more mature women will enjoy this, such as women between ages 15-25."
Dandadan,"I normally wouldn't do a preliminary review, but I'm fairly confident my opinion on this won't change with the anime's conclusion.I want so desperately not to have beef with this show. Its elaborate and unique animation makes watching it a complete joy. My main issue comes with the fanservice. Look, not all fanservice is terrible, with of-age characters in certain contexts I can't be all that butt hurt about it, but here it just feels excessive.DanDaDan's fanservice isn't in a traditional sense, the animation isn't as sexualized as the plot itself... which is interesting. In the first episode, something happens that is borderline rape,...and this is very quickly never mentioned again. If you are going that route and you want the aliens to be hypersexual at least have it be traumatizing and not played for laughs. So much of what happens could be horrifying if they framed it like that. The tone is what separates this from being a smart commentary on hypersexualization. Instead, this ends up as a horny show for horny teens.It just feels like a waste of so many cool ideas. I can't hate this show, because it does a lot right, so at the end of the day I can't be too harsh on my rating, but it's hard to recommend earnestly."
Meitantei Conan: Hannin no Hanzawa-san,"I don't really know who this was made for. It's in this sort of weird limbo state for fans of Conan or those completely new to the series. However, this is probably my very personal opinion, I really don't like this style of comedy for Conan. You watch Conan for so long, and you get really used to the tone of the show, so this weird comedy seems very disorienting. But that's pretty much my only issue. The comedy is just okay, and it's a weird change from normal Conan. But, for a comedy anime, if the comedy falls flat, so does the entire show,...and that's why I find this whole anime pretty mid.There are things to enjoy and why I wish the comedy was better. I like the art style; I like to see the reimagined designs of the Conan characters, especially Conan himself. He looks more like the early seasons of Conan, which I've always preferred. I like all of them except for Ran because why is her hair spike just sticking straight out of the middle of her hair lol? I was surprised that I enjoyed Hanzawa as much as I did for literally being a featureless person, there was something charming about the way he expressed himself. Also, major points for me because I love Shouta Aoi and it was a nice surprise to hear him (missed opportunity that they didn't get him to do the OP).There were a few things I liked about the comedy. Conan is a bit of a ridiculous series, yet it requires you to suspend disbelief. So when this show makes fun of Conan, it can be fun and refreshing to see the show become more self-aware.Anyway, I wouldn't say it was worth it, but then again, there are only 12 episodes, 10 minutes each. If you're a Conan fan, that's the equivalent of 2 seconds in comparison to everything else, so this means nothing to you, you might as well check it out. But if you've been debating about watching it or not, nah it's not really worth it."
Hatsukoi Limited.,"5/10 AveragesFor those avoiding spoilers: The pairings in this show are absolutely terrible. I didn’t like them at all. That said, I did enjoy the premise of this massive romance hexagon where everything is supposed to connect by the end, if that’s what actually happened, which it didn’t. What I did appreciate is how the male characters are somewhat realistic, they’re flawed, relatively plain, and even kind of ugly. One of them is a huge pervert, borderline sexual assaulter, which honestly made him unbearable to watch. But let’s dive deeper:Spoilers ahead.Let’s start with the main couple. We get an open ending, which already...pissed me off. We don’t know which of the brothers she chooses, even though it’s obvious she was really in love with the younger one. The older brother was a decent character, but he just wasn’t my cup of tea. He’s big and gentle, but why the hell does he love fighting so much? It’s completely out of character for someone who’s supposed to be “calm and kind"" so screw this guy and screw this ship.Then there’s the other love triangle that made no sense whatsoever. The super-hot girl (Yamamoto, or whatever her name is) randomly falls in love with a guy just because he gave her a lollipop. Seriously, a lollipop? Come on, author, you could’ve done better. She was stuck in a love triangle with the lollipop guy’s best friend and her childhood friend, but neither of those stories gets proper closure. The childhood friend is the one from the main ship and after he is rejected he is shoved into yet another love triangle, poor guy😭, just let him rest so screw this ship and screw this love triangle ALSO the best friend ends up with his sister. Yes, his sisterNow, I’ll admit I don’t hate incest stories (don’t judge me), but if you’re going to go there, at least give us proper closure for the most popular girl in the cast. The brocon subplot had potential, but instead, it fizzles out into nothing.As for the other pairings? They’re irrelevant. They get minimal development and are resolved instantly. But the one I hated the most was the beautiful girl and the disgusting pervert. Where do I even start? This guy is an extreme pervert, borderline criminal. A few things happens he acts kind and serious blah blah, and somehow the beautiful girl falls for him, BULLSHIT, Are you kidding me? This is such lazy writing. I’ve seen this trope a thousand times, and it never gets better. The whole “ugly, creepy loser gets the perfect girl” plot needs to die. Whoever wrote this needs to step outside, touch some grass, and reflect on the time they wasted writing this Wattpad ahh type of shit.Final thoughtsI said what I needed to say. I wish they’d given us more of the sister/brother subplot, but it is what it is. This show tried to be Amagami SS without the “same guy, different girls” premise and failed miserably. I hate open endings, so that’s another red flag for anyone thinking about watching this. The OP and ED are generic as hell, and while the animation is decent (reminds me of Amagami), it’s nothing spectacular.In the end, this is one of the most annoying romcoms I’ve ever watched. The romantic hexagon resolves itself in the most anticlimactic way possible. Honestly, screw this show."
Mononoke Movie: Karakasa,"I loved the original series and had been looking forward to this movie for ages.  Sadly, I can only assume that whoever was in charge of it decided that since everyone loved all of the beautiful and artistic scenery, let’s quadruple them and then rapidly flash at least three for every sentence shown in the subtitles.   So fast that you can barely keep up with the reading. I had to constantly pause just to read and still ended up with a massive headache and felt dizzy.  What an appalling movie, I literally cried with disappointment.It seems I cann’t publish...this without more words, but I really have nothing else to say about this movie."
Kami no Tou: Koubou-sen,"Okay, so we all pretty much know the story by now, so let’s skip the recap and get straight to it.What’s changed since Part 1? Well, you could argue a lot has changed - or maybe nothing at all. What has changed is the animation, and not in a good way. Somehow, it’s managed to get even worse compared to the Part 1, setting a new low for the series. For anyone coming off the high of Season 1, this is a crushing disappointment. Don’t believe me? Here’s an example: the first seven minutes of Episode 9 feel like they’ve got maybe 200 unique frames....I’m talking actual frames here. Okay, maybe that’s an exaggeration, but it sure doesn’t feel like it. Running animations are just three frames on loop, and the fight scenes? They’re as dynamic and smooth as a gazelle with broken legs having two strokes at once. If you managed to make it past Episode 8, congratulations - you’ve got more patience than I do. For me, it was unbearable. The animation isn’t just generic - it’s outright bad.The music is still great, but it’s completely buried in the background now. It doesn’t carry the same punch it had in Season 1. Whoever was responsible for the sound design dropped the ball hard here. All they had to do was copy-paste what worked before, but somehow, they still messed it up.Let’s just call it like it is: giving this IP to this studio was a massive mistake. Years of waiting, years of hype, and what did we get? A flaming disaster with nothing but ashes left behind. At this point, I honestly think you’d have a better experience just reading the source material while listening to the music from Season 1.It’s not like this adaptation was doomed from the start. They had everything they needed to succeed - Season 1 proved that. But whatever spark it had, it’s completely gone now.To sum it up: whether you liked the unique art style of Season 1 or not, Season 2’s animation is just plain awful, art style be damned."
Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"The problem with the other ratings is that people are taking this show too seriously. its a parody, its meant to be silly and tropey, have some whimsy in your heart for god's sake!Anyway, I love this show sm! the mc is genuinely a nice guy who loves all his gfs equally and sees the best in each of them (and theyre all unique). I usually don't like harem so I'm just as surprised. The artstyle is cute, the relationships between the girls themselves make sense and their insecurities aswell, it's genuinely funny...nothing bad to report and anyone wanting something feel-good-ish to watch will like...it probably"
Mahoutsukai ni Narenakatta Onnanoko no Hanashi,"Mahoutsukai ni Narenakatta Onnanoko no Hanashi is an anime about the typical girl who goes to school and must partially fix the established status in society, but I agree that we do not reach the cliché but rather we touch it. The variants that this project has in plot and animation give this anime its own style, such as:1- the protagonist does not fix everything when she starts school nor does she learn quickly to use magic2- the magic system is interesting and peculiar, it is explained little by little but it does not go into much depth in the origin3- The social problem of...the plot is mostly about the use of magic, leaving behind those clichés of the poor against the rich and there are no fights or contempt of the students of the different courses4- characters are nice with different personalities, the only defect is that they only focus on the development of the main cast, which is the norm, but with the type of story it can be counterproductive to leave many characters behind and Certain characters only appear when the plot requires it, not having an organic relationship with the other characters. For me, they have been able to overcome these deficiencies, which will not be annoying to the viewer.5- The animation, with this crayon-like style and light pastel color palettes, gives it a fresh air and its own identity. It is clear that they were careful not to over-exploit the color palette with brightness at every moment, since this would have been a problem with the close-up scenes. The only fault, but a minor one, that I found is a certain sloppiness in the shots from afar, something common."
Kidou Senshi Zeta Gundam,"Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam is a peculiar and frustrating series. Still, there are some things in it I do like. First of all, I admire the audacity of following up the relatively straightforward war story of Mobile Suit Gundam with a conflict that's much thornier and more complex and ideological. The Earth Federation are placed in the roles of antagonists this time round, the domineering attitude they had towards the colonies in the original MSG evolving into a more imperialistic outlook, which nicely reflects the establishment of America's place in the global order following WW2. I also like that the Federation's new mobile suits incorporate...a mixture of Federation and Zeon design flourishes, which demonstrates how Zeon's technology has been folded back into Federation R&D without having to say it outright. There are moments where the terrible impact of war is demonstrated in quite a chilling, visceral manner, although I would have liked more of them. The animation is very much improved from MSG, as you would expect with the six year gap between the start of this and the start of the original series, with both a lot more frames of animation and detail within those frames, which does a lot to show off the excellent technical design, which is just as good as it was before, and arguably better having shed some of the more toyetic elements from MSG. Much as I did not particularly like the series that bears it's name, I have to say that the Zeta Gundam itself is a great setting out of the stall for how the central Gundam in a series can radically depart from what came before while still retaining enough recognisable design language such that you can look at it and instantly think ""Gundam"". The Zeta is bigger, sleeker, and more elaborate than the original, as befits the leap in animation quality.Here, unfortunately, the positives end. There are a couple of significant points which I think mostly contribute to why Zeta Gundam didn't work as well as the original series. The first, and more severe of the issues, is that Yoshiyuki Tomino can write character drama about as well as a fish can juggle chainsaws. I had problems with the character writing in the original MSG and sometimes found it hard to follow characters motivations or understand their actions. This is much worse, with a lot of characters acting in ways that cross over from irrational into truly unfathomable. Kamille is a more impulsive and emotional protagonist than Amuro, and I like that he is different from his predecessor, but an increased emphasis on the protagonist's feelings and relationships exposes the flaws in the character writing a lot more than Mobile Suit Gundam, and it does unavoidably feel jarring that the writing hasn't increased in quality in line with the look of the thing. The female characters get it particularly badly, there's more than one subplot that made me feel like I had been cornered at a party by an elderly relative who wanted to tell me about ""what the deal is with women"". I think this was actually made worse by the fact that there were some female characters like Emma and Haman who weren't like this because it reminded me of what I wasn't getting from most of the others. I'm sure the quality of the translation on Crunchyroll's subtitles didn't help but the dialogue has all the zip and spark of unflavoured jelly. Zeta Gundam also places a much larger all around focus on the emergence of newtypes and the psychic experience of being a newtype and the intensity and strangeness of this power is absolutely not conveyed well at all by characters staring directly into the camera and saying that they're having a psychic experience. Char is back, but he's a protagonist now, which instantly makes him less interesting because he has less things to do and you don't get as much of the cunning thought processes that made him a compelling antagonist in the previous series. Also it feels like a character expresses anger in a professional context by beating up a subordinate at least once an episode which goes from shocking to laughable to aggravating to both aggravating and laughable as the series goes on. The second main problem is that the plot in general, while it contains several interesting ideas, feels wildly haphazard. The series feels bloated at 50 episodes and the characters spend a lot of time fucking about, moving from place to place not really achieving anything. If the intention was to get across the crushing futility of a long term low-level conflict, it achieved that and I hate it. If the intention was to show a vertical slice of the different theatres more like MSG, it's more of a failure. The White Base's long, treacherous journey back to friendly territory in MSG helped string a lot of bits of that series together into something approximating a compelling narrative and without the help of that framing device you're lost here from the get go. Speaking of conflict, I feel like there was overall much less of a focus on combat tactics in the action scenes this time, and a lot more of mobile suits just flying at each other in a disorganised brawl, which did make a lot of them feel repetitive compared to MSG. Also much like MSG it just sort of stops unsatisfyingly at the end, although I think the last two episodes are overall some of the best of the series. Still, the road to get there is so arduous that by that time I really just wanted it to stop.I haven't seen the instalments in the UC after Zeta yet. If they're good, it might justify my sitting through this. If not, I will be forced to conclude I've absolutely wasted fifty episodes of watch time on this one."
Sousou no Frieren,"Frieren is a unique show. I like what the show is trying to do, but I don’t think it does it very well. It has a good story but no plot. Not much happens per episode and Frieren herself doesn’t have goals, which makes the show feel aimless. She’s trying to learn as much magic as possible just to learn it, I guess. MAL lists it as an adventure anime but it’s more like a slice of life. I understand why it’s so popular—it deals with themes anime doesn’t normally deal with, but it lacks certain storytelling fundamentals. It's also really boring."
Seirei Gensouki 2,"Out of all the anime that is ongoing this season. This has been the one I have looked forward to the most, yet as the episodes have gone on I have lost a lot of interest in this show. When I finished season 1, it was 2 weeks before season 2 was set to release so to say I was hyped was an understatement. My initial rating for season 1 was a 10/10 and I still stand by that. Each episode was full of suspense. Seeing Haruto's beginning and literally being on the verge of death. It was such an incredible start and every episode...of Seirai had me hooked. Not to mention there was a lot of characters that I enjoyed from the very beginning and I feel like it did a great job introducing us to some of the villains from the start. The Main MC with a horrible past also didn't turn into a douchebag even though he had every right to do so. It was great. That was one of the things I disliked about shield hero. The main MC was really cold in season 1, even to those that hadn't done anything wrong. Haruto wasn't like that.Season 2 however, to say it has fallen flat would be a nice way of putting it. It has been nothing short of disappointing, boring, devoid of character. It has been nothing but 1 big disappointment. It almost feels like the creators have forgotten what they was even wanting to do with the show because as of writing this review, I am currently up to date with the series and not once can I think of anything note-worthy or remotely interesting because it has either been meetings (the slime isekai effect) or doing whatever. Very very very little plot progression has actually taken place thus far and it is so sad to see. I can let it go for at least the first episode or two because most new seasons of an anime don't start off crazy, but after 8 episodes I was expecting something to have happened by now.I also find it frustrating that Haruto literally will not tell anyone about his past. It's not like it will effect anything major. He's literally living with people from his past life and yet they're still going with ""I have a past life, I'm just not going to tell anyone"" because why? It's a shame. I do like Haruto, as an MC I find him to be super likable, but his constant need to keep things a secret just wares thin after a while. In season 1 Haruto was so focused on his goal and was a nice guy that didn't take shit from no one. In season 2 he feels way too relaxed and not really bothered to continue his journey. It's almost like he has come too complacent.Maybe the manga is more fast pace and they've chosen to adapt the slowest bit of the anime, but getting through season 2 has honestly been a slog and I don't know why I'm still watching it. Unless the final few episodes go absolutely crazy I can't see myself watching a season 3 as watching this season has been a complete waste of time. If you're reading this review after finishing season 1. Just skip this season, I promise you won't miss ANYTHING of importance. It's basically all filler.5/10"
"Gaikotsu Kishi-sama, Tadaima Isekai e Odekakechuu","You know what, I was really surprised when I read the reviews of the hate this anime adaption receives.This is the second time I have seen people complain about animes with similar characters.I wish people would put aside similar animes and just watch a show for what it is. It may have similarities with other titles, but it should just be enjoyed in it's own right.The art style was good as well as the fluidity of the combat scenes.It was funny & ott with some hilarious scenes. The fact they put Ponta in sealed the deal. It was a good fantasy...isekai.Episode 1 however wasn't for me , due to inappropriate sexual references to rape.It's a shame we've been left with more questions than answers, as there seems to be little hope for a season 2.I want to see Arc break the curse!"
Seirei Gensouki,"Average, inoffensive, unassuming, unimpressive. If I could summarize everything, my reaction to this entire show is the neutral face emoji. This isn't a show that just tapes together 60 isekai tropes and calls it a day, but it also never rises above that level of quality. When I finished watching Spirit Chronicles, I wasn't annoyed like when I watch something bad. I also wasn't in a good mood either. I left just like I came, forgetting everything an hour later. In fact, I had to rewatch it just to remember what happened.The plot was a little boring, but not insulting or painful to watch. It...just had nothing impressive about it whatsoever. It is the usual formula of: Rio (MC) is secretly cool --> Hogwarts for nobility --> discrimination against Rio for being a peasant featuring the nobles who are comically evil assholes. The deviation here is that the story doesn't follow a line where the MC ""proves them wrong by doing some sicko mode moves"". It happens, but generally doesn't change much. Then it's the usual isekai from there onwards.I bring this up to illustrate a larger point that occurs over the entire story. Spirit Chronicles DOES deviate from the norm here and there, but it's not in any way that results in a meaningful improvement for the story. It is different in technicalities, but overall it is just the same. However, you take what you can get. It's better to watch something with differences rather than stock characters repeating stock phrases for 12 episodes in a stock story.Speaking of the discrimination due to nobles, in this specific example, the lack of any meaningful retribution against the discrimination Rio faces leaves a sour taste in the viewer's mouth. He just gets picked on and nothing happens in return. Rio does nothing about it and doesn't seem to want to do anything about it. There is no hint of ill-will whatsoever. This is unbelievable to the viewer because the main plot is a revenge plot, yet Rio does not seem interested in revenge the first few episodes.Rio does not have any personality except being the protagonist cardboard cutout. His dialogue is the most boring, standard thing ever. It is not entirely made of the usual isekai one-liners, but it's just either formalities or neutral statements like ""What is that? Who are you?"" etc. There is no character behind anything he says or does. He also looks like a Final Fantasy character so that's a minus.As for the characters, the main villain who does things in the background is okay. Some of the important side characters like Celia, the princesses and Latifa were fine. Everyone in the spirit village was boring and unimaginative. That village only exists just to remind you that it is a fantasy show and also to throw anthropomorphic waifus at you. The area which was basically a self-insert of Japan was okay. It makes you think how since isekais are so ass at using the medieval Europe setting, maybe it would have been more interesting to portray Japan. Just food for thought."
Dandadan,"Its weird, you can't explain it to people without saying バナナ, you cant let people walk in at the wrong moment, but its such a laugh. At least give ep1 a try, if it the humour doesn't land then you certainty wont enjoy itAs someone who was recommended it off just ""the sound track is god tier"", I didn't come it with an expectations. However, it has been an amazing and easy watch. Some predictable moments yes, but they are funny, contextualised and add to the messy nature of the story but in a good way.The art? Its a good classic mix of some...chibi deadpan anger, some amazingly animated fight scenes and then some I'd say decent to semi-decent scenery. Overall its of high value and defiantly a good source for inspiration if you like to draw some characters every now and again."
Tensai Ouji no Akaji Kokka Saisei Jutsu,"Tensai Ouji felt like a mixed bag, there are some good ideas in this show, while there are also very tedious ones. The overall balance is somewhat neutral, I think it's fairly easy to overlook these anime's flaws and enjoy it for what it has to offer, but it remains a pretty average show and won't appeal to everyone.I'll try to give more details in this review to explain the mixed feelings that made me drop this show, not because it's a bad one, but simply because I wasn't hooked enough.Let's start off with the things done right, the voice acting is good...( and you'll recognize famous seiyuus ), the plot in itself is pretty decent, meaning that this show will try to approach things in a large scale to develop the kingdom's economy, they focus on battle strategy at times etc... Those aspects were refreshing, and I guess some character designs are done well, but unfortunately, that's about it for the pros, now let's talk about the cons...The animation is average, the fighting scenes aren't really good, the scenery is the same one you can find in a hundred other fantasy anime shows. The characters and the dialogues are poorly written, or let's say that they could have been way better considering the plot and its events. They are trying to go for a mastermind MC and there's nothing wrong with that, but here, it's hard to believe because he'll act like a crybaby in every episode for ""obvious"" comic purposes. ( which aren't funny ) The jokes never really hit because they are too predictable and/or too blunt. It feels like every character has one or two traits and that's about it, everything they'll say will serve as a way to highlight the trait A or the trait B and it gets boring pretty quickly.All in all, I can't recommend this show because even if it has a few good ideas, they are hindered by many poor choices, whom are almost all linked with the poor writing for characters and dialogues. Now, I don't mean to sound too harsh, this anime isn't the first that fails at being unique and that relies on common tropes, it's rather common in the anime industry and Tensai Ouji isn't a bad show, but there are many better fantasy animes out there before you should think about watching this one, unless you are looking specifically for a ""grand scheme of nations politics "" anime without big expectations, because in that case, this anime might please you."
Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 3rd Season,"There's some excellent production quality and bursts of wonderful dialogue, combined with that trademark Re:Zero puzzlebox that just delights, but this season has gotten completely bogged down.Tens of minutes of characters saying the same things over and over again. Nearly an entire episode devoted to a self-indulgent speech (combined with, again, characters repeating themselves ad naueseam). Far too much of this season is spent in redundant board meetings, generic pontificating about what a man or woman should do, and in the grating prattling of a Sin Archbishop introducing themself for the fourth time. It was terrifying when Betelgeuse did it. It's irritating now."
Mahou Shoujo ni Akogarete,"Before I start, there needs to be one small note. There is a big difference between English translation and Japanese from what Ive read. In English translation the characters are made way younger than they are originally. If Ive read correctly, the characters should be in high school, around 17-18. English translation says they are 14. This is just for your note. There is also one character, but she isnt really sexualized as herself in the anime/H.Now the show. I like the overall idea of the show. Quite the deconstruction of the evil side in Mahou Shojo genere with a huge 18+ twist. I wont...lie, im a frequent consumer of 18+ content, and not just a consumer. So I very much like the gushing side and that the evil side has been turned from ""kill kill kill"" into ""lets enjoy ourselves and corrupt"". The series has its ups and downs, some episodes were pretty good, many of them were mediocre in my opinion. It was mainly of the repetition in the middle of of the show, where Utena was basically just come do smt small and run. The ending, where the characters grow was actually the wholesome part of the anime.It aint really bad, I just hate the translators for taking their liberties, that they shouldnt have, in de-aging the characters a significant bit, that is in way too far in loli territory. Because it doesnt make sense, because apparently in Manga it very much destroys this notion that they are this age or so I heard. Season 2 was announced, so Ill be kinda passively waiting till it comes out. Not overly excited like for the likes of Overlord Season 5, but still slightly looking forward to it."
Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 3rd Season,"Im so dissapointed, if second season was meh but watchable this is just a cringefest... Who is the writer aiming ???Have they realised the original fanbase of this anime is growing older ??? But instead of giving US gore, psychological mistery like they promise US firts season this slowly has become a Loli harem ecchi isekai, did they think we would not notice .... Give me a break the LUST  archbishop is a Loli... And ok let pretend wencan ignore that, but where is the plot ? 8 chapters and one of them count as 4 chapters and absolutly NOTHING of value happen..., SO for 11 to 12 chapters of and anime nothing happen, they told ua hahahaha wait until feb, but didnt this anime had like some years before this season, this was just talking and lame talking at that.... The dialogues were SO vapid, shallow and void of any soul, just talking.Listen at this point i think this is just an anime that the sole pouroose is to sell them light novel, they cut before the fight.... Just two months SO people go and read the light novel, shameless.At this point this anime feels like an abusive relationship where i just stay for the time cost fallacy, i invest SO much time and years, that i don't want to drop cuz i want to know what is the point of everything.... But spoiler ALERT there is no point, just lolis"
Dandadan,"Ah, Dandadan. How mixed are the feelings I have for you that the more I think about it the more the rating drops.So, the character designs are great. I love the art for the series. And when the story gets good it gets GOOD (looking at you, Acrobatic Silky). But for the most part a lot of the series is really a miss. It spends far too much time on banana jokes and treating SA like a humorous plot device. Ayase and Okarun are decent characters, but Aira is completely annoying. Bouncing between the Aliens and the Ghosts/Demons can be jarring, and the aliens...themselves are disturbing in the worst way.Honestly, Dandadan works for a certain crowd, and it isn't the worst thing ever released. Its got a few really good things going for it, but you really have to be willing to deal with a lot of questionable content. Not for everyone."
"Saikyou no Shienshoku ""Wajutsushi"" de Aru Ore wa Sekai Saikyou Clan wo Shitagaeru","MC isn't a typical generic character. His atrocious ways of doing things is what makes this anime sooo goood. The way this anime describes the dark side of reality is what makes this anime so interesting. The art style, character development, and reaction to new situations is flawless. His character doesn't fail to represent a merciless mc described as the title of the anime. If you don't like heartless evil characters, this isn't the right anime for you but if you want something unique and thrilling, this anime will surely not fail you. Just watch the first 2 episodes and you'll see what I mean....That being said, I am giving a 10/10 in my books so far."
Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 3rd Season,"Re:Zero has long been one of the most iconic and beloved anime, but as the series progresses into its seemingly endless stretches of episodes, it's clear that it has lost its initial spark. Here is why Re:Zero is now a mediocre anime at best:1. Boring characters / Too much focus on side charactersWho doesn't love good side characters that add depth to the storyline and contribute to the development of the main character? You will not find that here, not anymore, the characters have very simple motivations things like ""hurr durr I am crazy and evil, I will destroy the world, come defeat me"", or...the ""I must get stronger and protect everyone, oh no I lost a battle, I now need 3 more episodes focused on me so I can overcome that hurdle"",  or who could forget the ""I am a good guy with 0 personality or brain, I am just a knight in shining armor coming to save the princess"". It's such a weird choice for the writers to make Subaru, a guy that been through hell and surround him with a bunch of bumbling idiots with generic goals that can be found in any other anime. No one wants to watch 5 episodes in a row dedicated to a side character that will complain and need reassurance every 5 minutes that they are not weak, focus on the main story and finish it, after that you can also make episodes for every side character in the anime for whoever is interested. Also why so many loli characters? New season = new loli side character with full story arc. I don't even think that most people like lolis, yet this anime seems to be doubling down on their loli stance.2. It goes on and on and on and onLet's talk about the length of the anime, sure it's not the longest anime out there, but it for sure feels that way at times, at this point does anyone even remember what was the main objective of Subaru? Exactly, not many people remember it and I believe that speaks volumes about the way in which the episodes were managed. Re:Zero risks alienating the very fans who once embraced its bold, fast-paced adventure. Instead of keeping the focus on the heart of the story this anime has become a sprawling mess of subplots and overextended character arcs that lack the urgency and thrill that made it a good anime in the first place.Feel free to watch this season as well if you're somehow still interested in this series, however, be prepared for more of the same, more story arcs about side characters that ultimately lead to nowhere and more anime cliches."
Atri: My Dear Moments,"This is an anime for the ages in my book. When i started playing ATRI the visual novel like a year or two ago (or longer i don't even remember) it was like a bright light shining into my pretty damn dull life. This concept is well, can be pretty interesting or really weird and creepy to some. The act that Atri is a robot creation and Natsuki is a man... well you can think of a few things why it could be weird, especially cos Atri is technically dressed and looks like a kid BUT let's look past that and see the anime for...all its intended glory.To be honest I started off the anime trying to reminisce the Visual Novel and how it compared to the anime, 1 episode in i scratched that. No, this anime deserved to be watched purely, with no comparisons, no knowing what's to come. Just pure enjoyment in the moment. The characters in the anime were seriously well built and had really amazing backstories, personalities and unique characteristics. I'm talking about all of them: Minamo, Ryuuji, Ririka, Catherine and more! And what can I say about the music in this anime, it was just perfect for everything that happened. But what I really want to talk about is the story, it really stretched that idea of post-apocalyptic into our heads and still managed to make it feel like happiness was just brimming there. Kinda makes me feel like ""If I were actually in that situation... life wouldn't be as bad as one might think."" The build up to the ending, the tension, the realisation of the past and everything was just so eye opening and I just couldn't stop watching. The end had me ugly crying, i mean this was a perfect way to sum up an anime we would have our heart attached to.If you're looking for an anime that gets you in the feels and is a rom com but its got a bit of a twist in it (that twist literally being a robot and human) honestly give it a try. It's got scenes of slice of life in it as well and hilarious parts all throughout. Trust me, its good and the robot and human thing won't even bother you after the first or second episode just cos of how adorable Atri is.All-in-all, if you have played the visual novel, please if you want to watch this anime watch it with a clean slate of mind and heart i promise you it's worth it. And if you are watching this anime without knowledge of the visual novel, enjoy every bit of episode you get from this because it is beautiful cinema."
Ping Pong the Animation,"Ping Pong the Animation upon my fourth viewing never ceases to amaze me with its profound themes about coming of age and romanization of not only table tennis and other sports alike, but life itself it seems.Similar to Hajime No Ippo, Ping Pong has the unique pleasure of being able to convey a sports story that focuses heavily on the characters presented simply by the nature of the sport being mano a mano: a direct competition between two individuals. It was a brilliant idea in my opinion for Taiyō Matsumoto to completely disregard the doubles aspect of table tennis and to emphasize solely on the...singles play. This decision in turn allows and provides critical characterization for each main player that the show spectacularly fleshes out to make the audience emphatic and relate to each player's trials and tribulations in regard to their way of playing table tennis.While taking upon the traditional sports shounen formula, Ping Pong deviates from its contemporaries by presenting some distasteful statements and moral objections that seem to flip the core value of sports shounen on its head. Most sports anime value hard work and dedication to the craft, and while Ping Pong doesn't gloss over that trait, the show isn't afraid to claim that hard work isn't always enough to be the best, and that those born with gifted talents can crush those who were born with lesser talent but instead have worked to where they are. It's an unpleasing statement that one can disagree with on a moral stand, but can it really be disagreed in a realistic nature? In this case the show provides a pretty realist take but that does not make the show cynical or pessimistic in the slightest, it only furthers the main dichotomy of ambition and sacrifice versus talent and joyfulness.The beautiful thing about Ping Pong is that these philosophical conflicts are battled out on the table, each character has a goal they are trying to obtain and it's satisfying visualizing their ideals through their play and style in the matches. Each player plays exactly how the audience would imagine they would play based on their personalties. The show's visual symbolism showcases a kind of magical realism that enhances the entertainment aspect of watching these matches, the audience feels that there is so much at stake each battle not in terms of whether a player wins or loses, but whether that player's relation to Ping Pong is true to them and propels them to perform their absolute best.""Who do you play table tennis for""?This quote seems very direct but throughout the show, it's a difficult question based on the past and motivations of these characters. It's such a brilliant ambiguous question that extends more to life itself: ""Why do we do the things we do""? All of the players have some sort of sentimental attachment to table tennis. Some more punished than others, some more free and liberating. But that's the most beautiful part of the show, each player regardless of circumstance is here in the moment playing table tennis. Their personal ideals and methods concerning table tennis is neither right or wrong, the fact they are still playing is the whole point of the show and what it aims to execute: self discovery through what you love best.I could write for days talking about other themes and tropes about this masterpiece of a show. Whether it's the complexity of friendships, the sacrifice of passion, or the facing of adversity, each viewing I am met with more lessons learned. To leave it off, I'll quote the hero's motif before one of his toughest battles that anyone can aspire to envelope themselves in when they're in a pinch:""I can fly! I shine like a star!"""
"Shangri-La Frontier: Kusoge Hunter, Kamige ni Idoman to su 2nd Season","Started a little slow, but picked up after a couple episodes. Then it went straight into the dumpster. We need nephilim washed away in a world wide flood, to bring things back to where they belong.The art work is the same. There's been a slight uptick in the animation quality this season. No problems on this front.The characters seem to have been a mixed bag. Bilac is the only one that seems to have gotten any real development so far. But the writing to introduce a new character has been sketchy at best. Why throw in this mecha silliness when she's already got...SLF experience? Which leads to the narrative writing. Why are they wasting multiple episodes on mecha trash? If I wanted to see that crap I'd queue up some Gundams. It's jarring to start off in fantasy land, and then BAM! suddenly it's a sci-fi cosmos, with no apparent need for any such transition.Most of the original VAs still doing a decent enough job. Although I think Sunrako and at least 2 of the new characters introduced are being overacted. So at least in that regard the direction slid compared to Season 1.Even if we get heaping helpings of vorpal bunnies for the rest of the season, damage has already been done. I'd have started this season off at an 88/100 B+ grade, but since then it's dumped to a B- at 82/100. I'll push through to the end of the season, but not sure the writers can keep this series from jumping the tracks."
Dr. Stone,"(HOOD REVIEW)I’m not even going to cap this anime was way better than I thought it would be. I really enjoyed it, if you ever seen death note just picture Light as the main character, but he uses science. And if you haven’t seen the death note, what I’m basically saying is the main character intelligence is on a whole different level and he uses science to defeat people, now that might sound boring, but I’m telling you to give it a try it will really shock you,Think about if you was going to war against a bunch of caveman that was using sticks...and stones as swords and you had the IQ to gather minerals and rare metals to build a Glock how do you think a caveman will act when you shoot at them? .. exactly watch this show"
Ragna Crimson,"For my 20th Review on MALWe have…..“Crimson”(Yes, there was another word before that but I’d like to forget that part)I was rather anticipating the binge of this series, a 48 min opening, a 24 episode season and “SILVERLINK” who have cooked up quite the resume of fantasy anime.Unfortunately, this is the 1st time i have absolutely hated a 48 min opening it was probably the worst i have ever seen by a mile. To give you a gist they decided to waste your time on some of the most unbelievably insulting writing imaginable. Who thought of this garbage? it's practically nonsense materialized. It's...fantasy that ignores any sort of realism or structure so it just fails to captivate it’s audience as it’s childish and stuffed with contrivances. What they were saying, what they were doing, I couldn't believe any of it. it's just a forced mess to try and create some sort of impactful introduction but it lacks any wisdom and understanding it's in essence purely amateur. I was ready to quit by the end of it but they gave a big hint that the source of that pathetic excuse of writing could die in the next episode so I soldiered on. I could fondly recall this inane sequence of the MC’s backstory which just made me burst out laughing. I will applaud that they are no stranger to death in this show which is refreshing.You can map my experience of this show onto an isosceles triangle with the 2 base angles being white signifying the beginning and the ending and the middle vertex angle being red, “crimson” red. We start from nothing, ascending into an eventful, and clever climax with very sharp and enjoyable moments but with a clear descent into a lacklustre ending.We are introduced to an acceptable cast of characters I didn’t hate many. I watched the show in the Dub and I was impressed, especially during the middle part. It had killer voice-acting and dialogue that left me almost in tears laughing. However the crown goes to Crimson, that character was pretty much the only reason i enjoyed these 24 episodes. Crimson just oozes with charisma, his motivations and actions are coherent and written with wisdom. You can really understand him and empathize with his decisions and the dialogue is ever lively with his presence. Whilst he’s on the screen the show almost feels like a banger however his brilliance is unfortunately dwarfed and adulterated by the sheer stupidity of the MC ""Ragna"" who is utterly insufferable and embodies the worst of the unfavourable shonen archetypes, as well as being a massive simp to boot. His motivations are very much mindless his understanding non-existent he is a tool for the plot and apologist when need be, and you really can’t connect with this character. They explore a unique way to give the MC an appropriate power early on, however It’s just too abrupt for me, it’s not got enough drawbacks and it just feels like a cheat-code. The power-up in question, is comparing a crack in the mud from your back-yard to The Grand Canyon. Comparing your local park’s anthill to Mount Everest. Another thing is I hate the idea of people becoming strong all on their own. It’s complete nonsense, no one becomes strong on their own some of the greatest people you know all had strong mentors at certain stages and teams willing to expend copious amount of effort to support them. It’s quite exciting the clear juxtaposition of the excellence of Crimson with the irrational, impulsive, ignorance of Ragna, the problem is these flaws of Ragna’s character shouldn’t really exist to this degree and are rewarded rather than punished. What’s more infuriating is that the nature of this Power-Up should eliminate most of Ragna’s character flaws either immediately or slowly. While there’s glimpses of that early-on ,this development is eventually replaced by “Shonen Main Character A” to my pure dismay, with a cabinet of plot-armor injected into his subsequent actions.Another peculiar choice is the setting of the show, it seems it take elements of different time periods of history and throw them all together. There's no tact here and from what i recall none of it is explained. I won't say it ruins the immersion but the military strategy and soundness is in absolute tatters sometimes you're left wondering why certain weapons are used when there are clearly better  options blatantly available. Then they just end up scrapping all that in favour of a single weapon intimately linked with the MC.The animation had very good drawing but really lacked a true potency in motion that other shows of this genre usually hold them up. Something like Fate UBW with a story and plot almost as bad as this one i couldn't help but give a high score because the soundtrack and animation were the greatest i had ever seen at the time, it's impossible not to get goosebumps whilst watching that but this did not generate spectacle that was that memorable.The Dragons were utterly terrible both in conception and in action. They are divided in classes but the sense of unity and family is just a farcical formality, those at the top share nothing in common with those at the bottom. They are suppose to give the collective impression of a great superior race but It could never be realized whilst they the stench of commonplace ""bad-guys"" and ""jobbers"". The only interesting ""dragons"" are those at the top and my quotation is intentional and they were butchered for the plot, with motivations that are simply headscratchers. These dragons have certain ridiculous limitations which are the limitations of other fantasy race/classes you've grown to love and they barely even keep the consistency of these limitations. The monster choreography is mediocre at best, it's littered with monsters just staring at characters and waiting to die. If you want to see real monsters go and binge the Chinese masterpiece ""A Record of a Mortal's Journey to Immortality"" you'll never respect this average level of choreography again. They call dragons the strongest beasts at the start but you'll be hard pressed to not see most as chaff by the end. They show promise at some points but they aren't allowed to shine as the plot armour on MC is strong. They're obsessed with the need for massive beasts with the strength several hundred times greater than the strongest of men not to mention potent magic abilities, to be one-shot by beings 1/1000th of their weight. There's also hardly any coherent and interesting teamwork outside of boss class monsters. It's usually either u get one-shot or the monsters get one-shot ,sometimes they sponge but it never felt like proper cut-off-the limbs sponging, it was hollow..There’s an art to depicting the act of “Dragon-Slaying”, and these guys are novices. There’s no nuance, there’s no specific anatomical points where the dragons are weak, the different types, natures and species of dragons are barely explored. I can’t help but feel we were robbed of the beauty of such wise exposition due to the main character and worst of all certain 5 foot sub 100 pound(45kg) girls sometimes not even older than 10 years cutting through them like fodder. These sub-elite class dragons are literally drone bots incapable of higher thinking which is in such opposition to how they are usually depicted. There should have been effective team-fighting sequences for these dragons but The problem with letting these individuals solo-kill dragons is that it's wholly ludicrous and dilutes how impressive a feat slaying dragons is supposed to be. There’s no weight to it, the grandiose idea of this Leviathan; this tremendous mythical creature is eventually brought to nought the longer you watch this show. The disrespect spreads to the dragon-slayers themselves being total nonentities outside of the “chosen ones”. Where is this association of Dragon-Slayers? Where is the Ranking system? Where is the union, the political influence? The hierarchy of dragon-slayers?, the fame of strong parties of them non-existent, there’s just nothing of substance here. This is a problem because it doesn’t any make civilization even possible, nevertheless one that has advanced to the level shown in the show. Where are those society can trust in to be safe? Due to the writing they were just poorly conceived plot devices because the only people capable of these feats are the ones close to MC at the right place and at the right time. It just doesn’t feel like the world exists outside of when it’s on screen perhaps more is explored in later seasons or chapters of the source. I must say at this point, I’m thoroughly disgusted seeing another group of strong warriors subordinate themselves to another shoulder-height, XX, giga-thanos, barely half their weight, half their age or lower, standing at a whopping 2/3rds of their height and 1/10th their muscle mass. This drivel is overdone in fantasy anime, I’m just taken a back, outright bewildered whenever I behold the empty farce of such a scenario.The last 4 episodes are a complete snoozefest I had predicted it’s ending by that point and in likewise fashion it turned out to be such a revolting conclusion, They of course, tried to make it all more believable by killing off more characters but when millions have perished without much thought to it, nothing even hits any more. Here we have mighty villains who have sworn pacts with strong wills who then basically set the heroes up to win in the best scenario. It ends up being truly incoherent and in complete antithesis of their goals, it's a shame because this kind of “tie-the-knot” , “let-the heroes-win” lazy writing is very much boring for seasoned anime watchers. The is final fight is consequently reduced to an anti-climactic mess.Final RatingsAnimation 8Sound 7Plot 5Characters 6Enjoyment 7= 33 - 6.6/10 - 7/10 - I can only recommended to fantasy enthusiasts like myself.So you’re thinking; how can you rate this 7 after you complained so much? Well I made it through 21 episodes(one being 48 min) without stopping. If an anime can keep it’s audience entertained for that long whilst being rather endearing in some areas it deserves some praise. The bad moments never completely wrecked the experience for me.If you've got time to waste and enjoy the odd fantasy experience with good laughs jam-packed inside then this is your show but the quality of writing outside of general dialogue and communication won't impress anyone. The gold of this show lies within “Crimson” and those that surround him it’s painfully average elsewhere. If this Crimson character didn’t exist, this would probably be another 5/10 garbage. Perhaps there are some important exposition laying in further instalments of this series but I have no desire to search that out. I wouldn’t mind a 2nd season comes out with another 24 episodes.For the 7 letters of Crimson I shall award a 7.Hope this Helps."
Black Fox,"Of all the anime we've ever watched, without a doubt, this is the worst*, in every aspect.Even if there are animes with terrible animations, stories or soundtrack, something good can stand out at some point. In this case, no! Black Fox manages to be mediocre at everything. There is nothing that can be even remotely pleasant in Black Fox. The fact that I didn't give it a minimum rating, just for a considerably common dubbing, doesn't deserve attention or merit, but it isn't unbearable.Without giving spoilers to the story, in case there is anyone who really wants to try watching it, I would say:- The...script is full of flaws and holes, with important facts for the plot, including the ending, which are never explained, just thrown to the viewer, not to mention several clichés, phrases with no effect whatsoever, without any real creativity or suspense , where it constantly tries to force some empathy on us for the characters, which is done in a lazy way;- There are few characters, and even so, for the plot to work, only 3 are really necessary, while the rest barely have screen time, they don't even really appear to be of any importance;- The mix of 2D and 3D effects is disgusting! Perhaps it was the worst combination of animation styles, not to mention the poor editing that the 3D received, which could be ignored from the beginning, and the experience wouldn't be so bad. The fact that it is a smaller studio does not justify it, as this anime came out a year after Sword Art Online: Gun Gale Online, also from Studio 3Hz, which despite any defects, its animation is infinitely better cared for;- The plot itself is never really discussed. In fact, proposing to be a work of self-discovery and deciding your destiny, the agenda is minimally mentioned. Nothing is innovative, not even the main idea, which had potential, ended up wasted, but from the beginning the film seems like it doesn't know where it's going. In fact, at the very end, the big suspense for a supposed sequel, besides being obvious from the beginning, is tedious and disconnected from everything that has already been shown;- The soundtrack... It's so simplistic, that it just goes unnoticed, as if it didn't even exist;- The art is basic, without great details or any care. The character design, in short, is without creativity or with minimal work to make them interesting; The depth and personality of each person is shallow and one-dimensional, if there is any;- The dubbing is just enough, acceptable. No, it's not good. Just tolerable;- A point to be highlighted are the characteristics of one of the characters, written to suffer from a kind of emotional dependence, almost Stockholm Syndrome (very poorly elaborated), but the insistence on believing in the villain's lies and deceit makes her unbearable for the your constant stupidity;Well, Black Fox will continue to be the worst anime that, in my experience, I have dedicated my screen time and patience to paying attention to. To be honest, Live Action, which came out a while later, can be better. A rare case! Because the directors decided to modify the entire script, the plot, and even certain designs, and it turned out surprisingly well, compared to the original material.  Black Fox is an anime that sets out to do nothing, and delivers even less.*This is just the honest opinion of a simple My Anime List user. Please don't be offended if you have a different opinion."
Shuumatsu Train Doko e Iku?,"From the first episode, an analogy with ""Kino's Journey"" arises. Each station somehow reveals different, often not entirely pleasant aspects of the world, which is reflected in Yoko's eyes. The main characters directly state — we never got to know her, and the journey serves as a method of revealing her worldview.The density of ideas here was multiplied by the brevity and simplicity of presentation. Because of the speed of the narrative and the absurdity of the form, it can be difficult to grasp the meaning of a particular scene. References to different anime, sometimes comical narration, familiar images that appear and collapse in...an unusual setting and combinations.Ikibukuro for the newly arrived Yoko, which looked unfamiliar and frightening as a hodgepodge of products and furnishings that are outlandish for her usual habitat and crawling out from everywhere, at the push of a button turns into its artistically framed and brought to the point of absurdity version - an urban jungle in the literal sense of the word.The selection of the protagonists reveals the views of different types of people. Akira gives metaphysical comments, tries to get to the meaning and categorizes according to theory. Kuga is straightforward, values beauty and has more mundane interests. Nadeko values social interaction and connection, and Shidzuru acts as a person of action and not words, in this case from the desire to protect her values, playing more of a driving force. If you dig into the names of the characters (not only the main characters, but also the secondary ones) - you can find a reflection and references to their roles.Maybe the river was not that big, maybe the distance between the stations was actually much smaller, but in Yoko's perception it feels like a huge space that is difficult to overcome.There are references to harmful but pleasant habits and drug addiction. To people who like to rush headlong without understanding the meaninglessness of their actions. To those who lure with a berry, but, in fact, are just scammers. To people who dedicate their lives to making the ball fall in the right place. For show-offs or believers who stagnate motionlessly. And so on."
Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season,"Just finished the final season of Shingeki no Kyojin, and I have to say, Hajime Isayama is a genius! The story made me laugh, cry, and ultimately broke my heart.Every character is interesting; I love them all. Even if Eren is my least favorite, by the end, I understand where he’s coming from.The anime never bored me. If you want a series with a captivating plot, action, and compelling characters, this is it. Just be prepared for emotional moments!I had a blast watching the battles against the man-eating titans for freedom in seasons 1, 2, and 3.Then, when it got to season 4 and...the final season, Isayama started showing the other side’s story and their point of view, which is where you see the results of ML’s decisions.Honestly, I have so many questions and he should have done this moment differently, but this is what made it interesting. I love everything about it. Shinzou wo sasageyo!"
Boushoku no Berserk,"Fate is the main character of this anime. The story starts with him in service to Knights, who should have held a higher standard within the domain they preside over, but that power over others corrupted them and led them to abuse and mistreat those lower in the feudal caste system than they were. These Knights have a bad reputation among all they meet, even Fate, for all other Knights in the domain. One day, Fate meets with Roxy, another Knight, and this sets a new standard and appearance for what Knight should be, leading him and others to a greater expectation of those who...watch over them. Eventually, Fate, wanting to protect Roxy, finds activates an inert ability, and later stumbles upon a special, sentient weapon which enables his faster growth in skill and capability. Fate grows stronger, constantly fighting newer, more powerful foes, trying to control his inert skill before it corrupts and devours him.This standard power grind anime - but it has a good story line; it shows the good side and bad side of individuals - the main characters face their own dilemmas of growing stronger and whether they can control the evil within. A good animation style which fits most - if not all - of the story. Didn't rate higher because it's still very open ended - loose ties. Where does it go from Season 1? I don't know because season 2 should have existed .... but it doesn't, and I can't manga due to ... reading issues."
Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen - Soukoku-tan,"TL;DR: In short, it is not good. And sadly it doesn't stop there, it's actually bad.First of all, I'm a big Bleach fan, but I won't say it's a masterpiece because it's not. In the same way, I don't criticize something for not being “as I expect” or because “it has destroyed the remembrance of my adolescence” if the product is adapted to the new times or whatever. My criticism is 100% objective (kinda), but if something isn't good then it isn't good, regardless of whether you are a fan or not. In this case I could establish three grade levels for the product:You're a...Bleach fan: it's bad, but well, it entertains and it's more Bleach. But... oh boy.You're a fan and a hardcore one: it's bad and an insult to all the characters of the original.You're not a fan: it's a crap without logic or sense. Average at best, but we all know is utterly shit.The script is laughable, a series of events with no apparent sense or logic. A ridiculous escalation of power without limit. There's no consistency in the facts, with respect to this season and not to mention with respect to the original Bleach.The plot? nonexistent. The dialogues are ridiculous and each episode has at least two or three “deus ex machina”.The fights? one after another. But in a very anticlimactic way, and where at least in the original, the enemies were interesting, here they are absurd (you have the Thor of the old comics, even with those little wings on his helmet, a WWW wrestler with his own hypeman, some fussy schoolgirls...).On the other hand, and this is not a problem for me, but since I have read that it is ""brutal"" and ""god-like"" it's worth mentioning. The animation isn't good, isn't bad either, but by no means it's good. There're numerous static images and the it has a lack of inbetweening in other animations (without reaching the level of BlueLock's new season). All of itdoes not seem appropriate for the product it is.Ichigo's Getsuga Tenshō couldn't be more sad (and static), it's almost as if he himself is tired and thinks “this anime should have ended a long time ago already.”The biggest problem is, it fails to create any kind of interest, tension or drama since you know that nothing that happens is final (someone dies? so they resurrect them. The bad guys achieve their goal? Well, another deus ex machina to solve it). The whole season has been like this, but this third part is even insulting.Each character dies and resurrects three or four times in the same episode, which make it loose any kind of effect on the viewer. It's ridiculous to see the leader explaining for five minutes how his bankai can destroy the universe. Then you watch the bankai sequence for another five minutes (spectacular though) all so that the enemy then resurrects just like if nothing and “defeats” his rival... which of course, even after being volatilized, resurrects in the next episode.""Normal” characters defeat infinitely powerful ones in a moment just because (like ""oh no, we ran out of time and need to move to the next thing. Make that guy kill that other guy, don't think twice, it doesn't matter for the coherence of the plot i guess"").Stuff like, the bad guy is going to achieve his goal and the good guys saying “let's stay here and let these four good for nothing take care of it and may God provide”, it's a real nonsense.Very powerful characters are now parodies of themselves.And of course, the worst thing: Ichigo screaming the whole fucking time “Ishida!!!”Orihime and her boobs is not fanservice or anything anymore, it's just ridiculous and annoying. Every episode they grow bigger and bigger (for real). At this point she probably should go to the hospital because she might have a major health problem. Believe me here, ridiculous.Now going into spoilers, but as we've all seen Bleach, and the other parts of this season, it's nothing important, it's just to show how absurd it can be.Orihime was slow to be able to heal someone, we've seen it before (when she heals Ichigo in the fight against Ulquiorra for example). But here in one second, she can joins the two halves of a guy split in two. Even if it doesn't work because it seems that he can't be saved for some reason, we know that she could save him because his power doesn't really heal, but rather it's a time reversal kinda thing.A shinigami stronger than the entire soul society is killed by Ishida just like that.The whole cast is immortal.The world is going to end and the only way to avoid it, is for someone to sacrifice himself (again, just because), that someone proceed to self-sacrifice and Rukia shouts “if you do it, what will become of the squad?”... it's like, if he doesn't do it, all the squads and the entire world will end. So maybe, shut up?I think, whit this all would be clear:We have squad zero, whose members are stronger than any of the rest of the soul society (more than Byakuya Kuchiki, than Kempachi...) and obviously, they have a leader, the strongest of them all. After bragging about the enormous power of his bankai for minutes and carrying it out, which takes as many minutes, the villain of the day not only doesn't get a scratch (later “weak” characters can hurt him) but he kills his rival, remember, the most powerful guy (the scene reminds, given the situation, of that from Indiana Jones movie with the sword and gun duel).Ok, he literally obliterates him. Next comes Ichigo and his four good-for-nothing bros (sadly one of them is the great Yoruichi, who it turns out is now more useless than Orihime and Chad) and a voice in the universe says: “say my name”, Ichigo who was never the smartest in his class, says “what do you want me to do?”... after an exchange of the same absurd phrases that leave the protagonist in evidence, this finally says his name with what *deus ex machina* the shinigami is resurrected just because. Then he (remember that he with all his power has been defeated)  says to Ichigo “only you can defeat him” (even if you don't have a fraction of my power, he should added). And he stays so cool, sending him and the other four idiots to the Sanctum Sanctorum.One would think that if the bad guy gets there and the world gonna ends, since he's resurrected he should help them even if he hasn't regained all his power. Or maybe all the others who are in the control center (Urahara, Rukia, Soi Fon, Ukitake...) instead of saying “are we going to win?” they could go help since everyone's fate is at stake. Someone would say “maybe they're too far away” well, maybe they could try to reach there at least intead of shrugs and says ""fuck it, it is what it is"", but that's no problem for Ishida (who was trapped in a super bankai much further away, he even resurrect or whatever and kills his powerful foe (I guess it's not really dead aand will come back later) the second most powerful in command and show up there to support his master. The thing is, with all, the bad guy achieves his goal, then Ukitake becomes full Resident Evil because bananas and deus ex machina, and the bad guy lost...Then the two dick-heads, Ishida and Ichigo, shouts their names and other absurdities for a while, and that were enough to make me give up and say “I don't have to swallow such a piece of shit no matter how much of a Bleach fan I am”. And watch out, all this is some of the most “logical/well-written” stuff you're going to find in this part of the season.So no, I don't recommend it, it's pretty bad, and it's ridiculous how the people is saying it's the best anime ever. Even if you love it (which I think is great) you have to be objective and see that it's not good.I would have loved it to be a masterpiece, or something I could really enjoy, but it simply isn't. And not for reasons of nostalgia, expectations, hype or anything like that, it's simply a bad product, quite poor in fact.The series is bad, it didn't start so badly, although it didn't start well either. But it sowed the seed of something big to come. The second part was really absurd, and this one is already ridiculous, same problem as the 2nd but bigger. And the worst thing is that it's not over yet... for the moment we have to wait for a fourth cour, that even if it ends up being a 10, in average would still fail."
Spy x Family Season 2,"Spy x Family season 2 is a total upgrade of season 1 in my opinion. I wasn't the biggest fan of season 1 as I feel it was too disconnected from the main family dynamic, particularly with Anya's school arc, but season 2 rectifies this heavily.I believe the family dynamic between Loid, Anya, And Yor is what makes Spy x Family great and season 2 leans heavily into the family dynamic a lot more which makes s2 extremely fun to watch.The whole premise of this arc is a ""family vacation"" and I feel this arc gave a lot of justice to Anya and Yor's...characters, specifically Yor. Yor absolutely stole the show in this season, especially in the finale, but I have to also give it to Anya that her shenanigans were both funny and added to the story.If you felt iffy about season 1 and felt wanting more like I did, I believe season 2 of Spy x Family will absolutely make up for it and more, it's extremely well done and a must watch."
"Ore wa Subete wo ""Parry"" suru: Gyaku Kanchigai no Sekai Saikyou wa Boukensha ni Naritai","I’m prefacing this review with one sentence: There’s a line between being dense and being stupid.Any aspiring adventurer should be looking for information about the job. Early on in episode 1, the MC’s dad tells him stories about adventurers, and he’s ecstatic about it. I understand that he lived alone and didn’t have access to books at an earlier age. But after moving to the city years later, did his curiosity about adventurers suddenly vanish? Did he never once try to read books about it? Are you telling me he never tried to have a conversation with anyone about adventurers? Never even had a casual,...mundane conversation about it? To the point where he doesn’t even know basic monsters like goblins?Spoiler alert: later in the episode, he ends up facing a goblin emperor. And what does he do? He assumes it’s just a regular goblin and blames himself for being weak, thinking he needs to train more. Bullshit! Train that smooth brain of yours! Look for more information about monsters, plants, etc. The MC is close with the guildmaster. If he asked, I’m sure the guildmaster would be willing to give him some resources, yet he never tries—not even once.If you think that’s it, then I have bad news. The MC also has an abysmally low ability to reason. Take the goblin emperor I mentioned above. Any sane human being would not associate a humongously large creature that can effortlessly hurl multiple tree logs with a weak monster supposedly meant for novice adventurers. In another episode, there’s a strange creature with wings and a big tail (Google Toothless dragon). What does the MC guess? It’s a frog. HOW?! And in the last episode, he apologizes to his sword for not having much action. Not having much action after literally preventing THE ANNIHILATION OF A COUNTRY! Sigh… Have you ever heard the phrase ""saving fish from drowning""? After wasting my time watching this anime, I now genuinely believe the MC would actually fish a fish out of water in the future, thinking he’s saving it.The only thing that can justify his mindset about the common sense of the world is that he lived alone in the forest for so long and never had any interaction with society. But then it comes back to the point I brought up in the beginning: the MC never tried to learn about the world, about monsters, about adventuring! He’s an actual blithering idiot.It’s honestly unbearable. I’m just hoping that later in the novel series, he’ll eventually grow up and gain some intelligence, but I’m not patient enough to read the novel to find out. If you like extreme stupid misunderstanding anime, then this is a 10/10 anime for you.All in all, this anime at the very least manages to achieve what’s written in the title, I Parry Everything. Although when I started watching it, I wasn’t expecting it would include parrying brain cells too.Now, that’s enough negativity. I have to give credit where it’s due. Granted, the MC’s stupidity did lead to some hilarious moments that made me laugh out loud. But those moments can be counted on one hand. It’s not worth the brain damage you’ll suffer trying to comprehend the MC’s actions. Oops, the negativity is back. Sorry, I can’t help but berate the MC.PS: As you can see, I’m only focused on the MC for this review because, well, he’s the damn main character. But, in short, they’re all idiots too, but the MC’s stupidity overshadows them like a moon casting a shadow over a grain of sand during an eclipse."
Kaifuku Jutsushi no Yarinaoshi,"This show to me was if a Summertime Saga fan created a fantasy/adventure anime because it is straight up perverted. Be careful on watching this thing especially on public. I can hardly recommend it lol.Animation (5/10) - Its animation to me is borderline passable. It didn't stood out too much and it felt like it was on mass-produced by a B-tier production house. Very standard schematics and fantasy-color scheming and it felt like watching a show from the early to mid 2010s making it a few years behind. Untimely but could be worst.Storyline (2/10) - This creation was made from the mind of just somebody...with some sort of porn addiction; The protagonist gains a new superpower after having sex ffs and it even had furry-based characters on it. After a plot problem was solve, the protagonist would just have sex on them almost every time at the end to grow stronger. Its odd and its concept setting aside sex is something that is not even unique to say the least considering there are already hundreds of fantasy adventure anime shows out there. Crazy.Soundtrack (5.5/10) - To me its soundtrack are decent; They are somewhat versatile with their library. It feels like they can be good enough to be utilized on video game projects revolving fantasy and adventures. But nothing too memorable if I am being honest. It's mediocre, meaning good but a bit forgettable too. Nothing that can evoke any strong feelings out of you. Props to it still though.OVerall - 4 out of 10"
Psycho-Pass Movie: Providence,"TL;DR: It's watchable and entertaining even if it doesn't make sense. Plot-wise it's uninteresting and a carbon copy of SAC's Individual Eleven The 2nd gig.I've always believed that Psycho Pass should have followed the line of the sublime first season: criminal investigation and a more thoughtful and methodical approach. But they went down a more action-centric path trying to mimic GitS SAC, but where in that one it was believable and logical, here it never quite clicks. Mainly due to the fact that the Public Safety Bureau is a civilian organization, not a military one, and its competencies would not be the ones represented. Or...that seeing individuals in suits and skirts facing special forces with state of the art equipment while they use their standard batons is not very credible.In the movie you will find everything that is in Psycho Pass after the first season. An action story with zero logic and a background that seems interesting or deep but that when you stop to analyze it shows its superficiality and little sense.The action scenes again aren't very credible (special ops losing as if they were random npcs, characters running and jumping even though they have been shot in the leg, jumps from great heights without consequences, some politics to fill and look like something serious, poor character development, etc.).The plot is bad and poorly written. It's also clearly the same as the Individual Eleven arc in The 2nd Gig (Some rogue squad wants to create an independent nation of Japan. They even use like in GitS the hacking of bodies and so on).The characters' motivations are not explained, the mix of agencies and how they ""fight"" is laughable, the protagonist's final act lacks conviction or logic on her part (and she might as well have done it at the beginning and saved us two hours). Sybil forgiving Akane is less and less believable in every iteration. And several scenes are blatantly poorly written to create ""tension"" or to force the script to go somewhere specific. There are also numerous absolutely laughable moments that make no sense whatsoever (like the bad guys not shooting and waiting to be shoot, or a character about to be killed shouts ""don't shoot, he has to be judged according to the law"" to the person who is going to save her. Even the bad guy and the good guy seem to think ""eeeh what?"").An example of the whole plot would be: the bad guy wants to press a button that will make the world end. The good guys discover that he is wrong and that they really want him to press it, because the result would be good. Even so, they decide to mess it up, to make a whole war to finally press it themselves in front of the bad guy.As I say, one would expect a Psycho Pass movie to be somewhat more realistic and better made (like the material it tries to imitate/homage) something to reference in the future. But this is just a plain, entertaining, fun and forgettable action film. Is that a bad thing? No, not at all. It is what it is and that's it.To put it bluntly, it could have been the original GITS, and it is its live-action adaptation"
Shoujo Kakumei Utena: Adolescence Mokushiroku,"Revolutionary Girl Utena, but if it was hype as fuck.Not to much to say about this movie, because it's just so much fun. Beautiful art, for one-- the school is wonderful to look at, and everyone's new designs are great. Everything moves and flows beautifully, it's hard to put my finger on it. The mechanical designs are also a marvel.Anthy was phenomenal in this movie--RGU is Utena's finale, while I consider this movie to be Anthy's. She's so fun to watch in this movie, and her arc is wonderful, especially her bit at the end. Watching her growth brought tears to my eyes.It took Touga...and Akio in a different direction than the television show. While Touga is much more likable here than he is in the show, I think his show's portrayal is a lot more nuanced and interesting. Akio, on the other hand, is great-- it's such a stark turn in presentation for him, but it's just as good as he is in this show, just different. His new voice actor brings such a different look to him, it's a great alternative exploration of his character.The entire movie is really a love letter to Utena, I consider this and the television show going hand in hand; I wouldn't watch one over the other."
Ergo Proxy,"This anime isn't for everybody,but i cannot help but love it . It doesn't deserve a 10 a 8 or maybe a 9 might be more appropriate but i think 10s are very personal while an 8 or a 9 can be objective a 10 can never be for if you give a show a 10 you are saying it doesn't have any flaws which of course every story has.this anime has beautiful animation making me question why even nearly 2 decades later some shows still look worse. the aesthetic of this show fits perfectly nothing looks out of place or weird making you...able to fully immerse yourself into it .some people think that the story has a bad pacing saying that it start of very fast then slows down and then picks up again . This is true but i don't care because it never became boring every episode has questions and answers it also gives a good look into the world and i think makes you able to appreciate and understand the ending a lot more . It isn't like in evangalion where in the original anime after watching the ending you don't understand what happened. This show answers all the questions that needed answering and if you don't understand it you clearly didn't watch attentively.beautiful story, sad that the neither the director and creator can reproduce the magic they had with this show."
Sousou no Frieren,"just funny, someone deleted my review... I give it a 9/10, maybe 10/10 if the new season is out.I don't know why this anime is so amazing, even though the story is relaxed, maybe the effect of slice of life. related to our daily lives. which is very relatable.My favorite character is of course the very adorable elf grandmother, then Fern with her big breasts. which I really want to hold even just once.this is a magic anime, and magic makes this anime make me give a good score and recommendation for this anime. either with full awareness or the influence of magic."
Major S1,"I watched all the seasons of Major (from season 1 to the damn OVA message), anyone who is hesitant to start watching this amazing show, don't be. Start watching NOW!! Yes, it is a bit slow however as someone who hates sports animes, this is one of the greatest animes I have ever watched. Not only do you get to see Shigeno grow up to be an amazing baseballer, but you get to see him grow as a person, I felt like I watched my son grow up. TBH if I have kids in the future, I know they will not make me happy as...I have felt watching this kid grow up to be the greatest. Please do yourself a favour and just watch all the seasons, trust me you will have no regrets."
Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo,"Where do I start about this Masterpiece ...This is one of those few animes where the screenwriting overcomes the Anime itself. Each and every episode of this anime is thoroughly researched and well-written. The character of Hajime Kindaichi, Inspector Kenmochi, Miyuki and Akechi are the principle characters in this whole series.Well, the basic formula is the same throughout the series. Kindaichi and friends travel somewhere, a murder happens or a chain of murder happens and the rest is the main plot of the series. But, there's a catch...No episode seems repetitive in plot , everything you see is new or rather better than the previous...one.The best thing is the backstory given to every character in a particular case. Even the culprit (s) of the crime have a logical reason.That's what makes this anime a Pleasant MASTERPIECE !!!"
Ginban Kaleidoscope,"My goodness, how do I even start?First of all, I'm really glad for stacks recommendation and post forum of MyAnimeList. This is how I found out about this anime. Second, I want to show my gratitude for this studio because I always thought anime studios big or small always have at least 3 to 5 anime in their name but this studio only has two. Kudos to all of the animators and staff that work on this anime, you are all amazing.Now let's start this review with animation. As expected from a retro anime, the animation is not that great but that is the charm...of it. Even tho it looks rough, it reminds you that this anime aired in the early twenties. Even the aspect of the show using 3:4, that's when you know it's old. I expected it to be rough and I get it how it is.Second, the OST. I love the ost so much. Usually, I don't want to talk too much about this because as you all know from my reviews, I always said that, as long as the OST and animation mix well together, I always give it appreciation. But not this one, dawg, because I want to praise it more. The OP and ED were an absolute banger, but the one that I want to talk about is the episode's OST. Like omg, I couldn't tell you how much I love it, especially the title OST. I don't know why but that OST just made me feel like I was playing Tom and Jerry Fist of Furry, it was that good and funny. When it was time to be serious, the OST flipped 180 degrees and really hit you good. It's so heartwarming to listen to.Okay now onto the plot/story. Honestly, I'm kind of disappointed on this one, I thought the moment Pete possessed Tazusa, he would have some control of her body but what I get is a hilarious soul ride. Some kind of parasite that lingers around its target and honestly I actually think this is better. Though, I thought it would be bad because, for the love of god, Tazusa could never talk in silence. Like, girl, you will be seen as a crazy person, please lower your voice. I'm not joking throughout the series I always scream through my PC saying, ""Stop embarrassing yourself"" but to my surprise, it actually works pretty well. Especially, when that gimmick got to be the plot for one of the episodes. (Poor Mika)Now, I want to talk about the VA. Just a quick one, they all do great. Especially for the English VA. I always thought the moment Anime using Japanese VA to voice a foreign character would be bad and I wouldn't like it for the rest of the series but here I felt like it was a great use of Japenenglish, because not all of the characters speak fluent English. So, I can actually understand that it was intentional to make them speak very weirdly in English.Last but not least, the characters. Oh boy, this section would be long but I simply going to talk about the two main characters, Tazusa and Pete.Tazusa as a character is very charming and annoying. She calls herself the most beautiful woman who ever existed (or something like that) making it clear that she is cocky and she will never get down until she gets what she wants. It actually charming for 16 years old girl, and very realistic as well because her rival is not exactly the same age as her.Then, Pete, he is as a character is very much just a guy that positive for every condition possible. He looks at things and thinks, ahh life is good, which is the opposite of Tazusa. That's why their chemistry is very good.Overall, I enjoy watching this series, I give this 8.7/10."
Ensemble Stars!! Road to Show!!,"This isn't the first time we've seen characters traveling to New York for a movie. It's entertaining to see them in a new setting, creating happy memories with their friends as they explore the wonders of this new country.Unfortunately the way Ensemble Stars: Road to Show does it leaves one feeling unfulfilled and wishing the movie had gone another route.Having a plot that derives from the main story of enstars can leave fans of the game, and prequel anime, feeling nervous for what's to come. There are brief mentions of event stories from the game, which are honestly not only better written but are also...the more interesting parts of the movie, so we're off to a rough start already.Had the rest of the movie been about the characters sightseeing New York, perhaps calling their friends back in Japan to share with them what they're experiencing, thus giving us more cameos to enjoy, the movie could've been more entertaining than it actually is.Instead we have a parkour chase scene that goes on for too long, New Yorkers that speak perfect Japanese and a predictable antagonist that lacks any understandable motivation.The last minutes of the movie seemed to drag on as the antagonist is exposed in such a way that isn't realistic or makes any sense and you're just left wondering, ""Was this even worth 1 hour of my time?""The answer is no, it was not.Had this movie been about more events from the game it could've been a great sequel, considering what the movie teases at the beginning about the new era of Ensemble Stars. A movie about how Crazy:B and ALKALOID came to be would've been far more interesting than what this movie ended up being.If you haven't seen this yet you're not missing out on anything. If you like the cast of characters it could be worth a watch, there are moments of fanservice sprinkled here and there that at least make the movie watchable, yet the plot itself leaves much to be desired.To quote a wise man, ""My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined""Rating: 5/10"
Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen - Soukoku-tan,"Bleach has always been a mediocre show overall, some high points and a lot of filler. So far the 5 episodes I have seen are decent comparatively speaking and it is worth checking out. The pacing, animation, and voice acting are all pretty good and enjoyable. The story is a bit incoherent but that's no surprise, I'm still failing to understand why Uryu wouldn't simply explain what's going on to Ichigo since they found time to talk while fighting anyway. Doesn't make sense to me, neither does Ichigo's attitude. The character development is a let down and I find myself siding with Yhwach who wants...to create something better no matter the sacrifice; which takes an iron will and selflessness to accomplish. The ""heroes"" are fighting to maintain the status quo out of sentimentality after having previously attempted to exterminate the Quincy, which as far as motivations go is rather repulsive and not something I can identify with. Yhwach has a vision to make things better, where the Shinigami fight for stasis and have no vision of a better future. After having been deceived and manipulated multiple times I would expect Ichigo's character to have grown to not blindly hurl himself into a fight he knows nothing about without seriously trying to get some answers at the very least, to know what it is he's actually fighting for or about and the consequences of it. It's yet another story sharing a message of trite emotionalism and how feelings will always triumph.tl;drDespite being better than most of the anime up to this point regarding certain aspects, the story and character development are a let down especially who is portrayed as either ""good"" or ""bad"". I find myself siding with Yhwach even though I know he is going to lose despite never having seen the ending."
5-toubun no Hanayome ∬,"Gotoubun no Hanayome Season 2 RewatchAfter rewatching both the anime and reading the manga of The Quintessential Quintuplets, I felt compelled to jot down my thoughts, even though my writing might not be perfect. These feelings stem from my deep love for this masterpiece. (This review is based solely on what Season 2 accomplished.)Even though this was just a rewatch, the sense of immersion was undeniably captivating. Season 2 was brilliantly adapted, far exceeding the original manga in many aspects. I’ve rarely encountered a romcom harem series that handles storylines, characters, and romantic drama as masterfully as 5-toubun no Hanayome.The second season continues Uesugi...Fuutarou's tutoring journey with the quintuplets, but this time, the story escalates into more intense drama compared to the lighthearted tone of the first season. With all five sisters realizing their feelings for Fuutarou and expressing them in their unique ways, the narrative becomes irresistibly engaging.Character Development: Flawlessly ExecutedThe character development in this series is phenomenal. It's hard to dislike any of the characters because each of them shines naturally, thanks to everyday scenarios that feel so relatable. Although Ichika, Nino, and Miku dominate screen time, Yotsuba and Itsuki are not overshadowed.Here are my impressions of the characters:IchikaHer internal struggles were excellently portrayed. I was struck by her line, ""I want to stay in this comfortable place forever,"" while walking with Fuutarou, as well as her selfish attempt to reclaim her jacket from Yotsuba with the words, ""I'm cold too."" These moments highlight how much Ichika, as the eldest, has sacrificed for her sisters. After receiving encouragement from both Miku and Yotsuba, she finally decides not to yield her current position to anyone, even her sisters, leading to impulsive, love-driven mistakes during the Sister War arc. Despite this, I can’t help but empathize with her. “It was all a lie.” — Ichika’s complexity speaks volumes.NinoNino's transformation is another standout. From a stubborn tsundere who initially despised Fuutarou, she eventually fell for him. Her spontaneous, unfiltered actions driven purely by emotion make her both charming and humorous. One of her standout internal monologues goes something like, ""I truly love who he is, even if I don’t accept the role he plays."" Nino's boldness makes her irresistible.Miku (My Favorite)Miku is an adorable kuudere who starts off as shy and insecure, believing herself to be the least capable among her sisters. She sets personal goals, like scoring the highest on exams or baking perfect bread, as a way to confess her feelings to Fuutarou. She even tries to mold herself into his ""ideal girlfriend"" (based on his teasing comments). However, Miku eventually realizes these goals were mere excuses to delay her confession due to her lack of confidence. Watching her grow into a more confident version of herself, culminating in her heartfelt confession during the festival arc, was deeply emotional. “I won’t hesitate anymore.” — Miku’s resilience makes her journey uniquely touching.YotsubaYotsuba is an energetic and selfless girl who always prioritizes her sisters over herself. Beneath her cheerful facade lies a sense of guilt—for failing to keep her promise to Fuutarou and for causing her sisters to transfer schools. She chooses to support her sisters from the shadows, despite harboring feelings for Fuutarou equal to theirs. Ultimately, Yotsuba’s true emotions couldn’t remain hidden forever.ItsukiThe youngest sister, Itsuki, tries to act mature to fill the void left by their deceased mother. While her romantic feelings for Fuutarou aren't as pronounced, her character retains a subtle charm. Despite being the one who spends the most time at Fuutarou’s house, Itsuki’s growth isn’t as prominent as her sisters’, yet her blend of seriousness and childish antics wins over many fans.Fuutarou UesugiAs the protagonist, Fuutarou also shines. I was particularly impressed when he considered quitting his tutoring job after doubting his ability to help the quintuplets. Despite coming from a poor background, he values hard-earned money and refuses to accept handouts. Fuutarou evolves from a studious, emotionless character to someone who truly cherishes his time with the quintuplets. “Meeting and tutoring them is the greatest accomplishment of my life.” — Uesugi Fuutarou.Animation & SoundtrackThe animation quality of Season 2 is exceptional, far surpassing the first season. Characters are more detailed, and important scenes are meticulously crafted. As the episodes progress, Studio Bibury elevates the visual quality, particularly in the latter arcs.The soundtrack is equally praiseworthy. The opening theme, Gotoubun no Katachi, is an upbeat track performed by the Nakano quintuplets, perfectly capturing the show’s essence. The ending song, Hatsukoi, is a soulful reflection of the sisters' emotions. Other background tracks, like Stupid Girl, add depth and charm to various scenes.Final ThoughtsGotoubun no Hanayome is a rare gem among romcom harems that I thoroughly enjoy revisiting. Its seemingly simple yet profound storyline, captivating narrative, and masterfully crafted characters make it a masterpiece in the genre. What’s truly remarkable is its avoidance of excessive fanservice, instead relying on witty, heartfelt romantic comedy and drama unique to the quintuplets.Scores:Plot: 9/10Animation: 10/10Character Development: 9/10Soundtrack: 10/10Enjoyment: 10/10Overall: 10/10 — A Masterpiece."
Violet Evergarden,"A show that delves into unique, post-war human experiences in a heartfelt level; Its a show that ultimately reminds us the beauty and frailty of humanity; Although it was a relatively short project, it found a way to pack various stories as it progresses. Couldn't recommend it enough.Animation (10/10) - A quintessential example of a project that was well-budgeted; Each movements on this show whether coming from a character or inanimate objects and sceneries comes along very-distinct and I'd argue almost Ghibli-esque. It was also great on evoking certain moods and atmospheres through its selective color usages (One of the most notable is the consistent...portrayal of hope whether the blue skies are being shown). The details engraved into this show are very distinct even to the most minute details.Storyline (9/10) - What I found amusing is although it only has a limited number of episodes, it didn't sticked in a subject point. The protagonist was able to meet people from various perspectives, which was very essential in developing her individuality consideration of her heartless upbringing. The characters were created in a cognizant threshold of memorable level, serving very essential in building up the protagonist's long-run of the story.Soundtrack (8/10) - Its soundtrack library consistently invested itself into classical songs and compositions, which was very harmonizing and allude to its theme, concept and storyflow. I do appreciate it for what it is. You can expect to feel at peace if you decided to give it a listen outside of the show's context, and are still good on aiding the show's narration and scene depictions.Overall - 9 out of 10"
Haikyuu!! Movie: Gomisuteba no Kessen,"It should've been a series, not a movie.I really love the story and this part is as good as the previous ones. I love character development, their motives and how they work in relationships. But there are so many moments that feel crammed and cramped. It really calls for standard pacing of a series where an episode is devoted solely to the back story of characters and their development. These are not obligatory but let you savor the moment and the atmosphere of the anime. Here they are hinted but not covered fully. The game is also half cut, there should be more actual volleyball...scenes to give you the appropriate thrill. Once again, the story is good, but it's told here not in the best way and it's really sad."
Make Heroine ga Oosugiru!,"Quite the dissapointment really. A story that would've been better be presented as a series of OVA's rather then a whole anime. No character development,and quite the painfully unsatisfying ending as well. The way the MC acted as an anchor for all these pretty horrible people is rather upsetting as well. The best character in the anime is by far the little sister. And the only reason im giving it a passing grade is because of the obviously satisfying animation. The story itself is worse then anything generic they could throw at you.If you like the ideea and want a better execution, i recommend Ore...wa Suki Nano wa Omae Dake ka yo."
Oh! Super Milk-chan,"The main things holding this back are the pacing and the formulaic structure.The show starts off strong, and the surrealist/avant-garde styling of the show is very very interesting at first. Problem is that once you get to about the halfway point in the series it becomes more and more of a slog to get though. Mainly because the formula it sticks to every episode gets old pretty quick and jokes that are actually funny get more and more sparse as the series drags on.If the show were shorter, about say, maybe a 10 minute show as opposed to a 20 minute one, and the show...didnt rely so much on the same jokes and same scenarios over and over, it'd be a lot better. Once youve seen the first like 5-6 episodes you've seen pretty much everything the show has to offer, save for a few good jokes here and there in the later episodes.This is about a 7/10 for me,  but not everyone will like it. If you want anime girls doing weird shit but with faster pacing, watch Di Gi Charat or Pop Team Epic instead."
Nige Jouzu no Wakagimi,"I wasn't looking forward to this tbh but I do like to watch all the WSJ adaptations when they come out so I kinda owed it to EluSam to check it out.I read most of this (I think up to E10) in the manga before the anime came out and found it boring and dry and... that did not change.It's kind of a boring, dry anime that gives ""history textbook"" vibes. I genuinely could not tell you what a couple of Tokiyuki's retainers' characters are supposed to be. Not to mention the antagonists are comically evil. If this wasn't a shonen anime, I wouldn't doubt...for a second they'd all be rapists. It's so overdone that I was shocked when an antagonist did something that wasn't ""nyeh, I'm gonna rip children's tongues out and make them slaves and I'm gonna build a harem of women after killing their husbands!""Not to mention how UGLY they are. One has buckteeth and can speak with his ears, one has big-ass bug eyes, one has creepy eyes and a painted face, one has ants crawling all over his body at all times, it's just an unpleasant show to watch.For what it's worth, CloverWorks did put a lot into this anime. There are points in this anime where it's very well animated and they have a lot of fun (I'd hope, at least) doing cool things that you wouldn't normally see in a middling WSJ adaptation. Maybe it's because the director has a sense of style (I don't know who directed this, admittedly, but, I mean, just look at it) and knows that, frankly, this series needs all the help it can get, but it was cool.That being said, and this is kind of unavoidable given how often they're on horseback (which makes my faith in a Steel Ball Run anime just sooooo high), but it'll switch between CGI and not for when they're on horses and it's not, like, awful, but it was noticeable, at least for me.I did like a couple of the characters. The Emperor's son was cool for the all of one scene he appeared in. Tokiyuki himself is okay. I like the main antagonist, I guess?Another thing is that the main cast (Yorishige aside) are all little kids? Like, Tokiyuki is NINE (apparently not young enough to avoid a BDSM joke according to this show but that's neither here nor there). I'm no historian so I can't speak to the historical accuracy of the show but idk, it's kind of weird to watch this show and then remember ""oh, they're all elementary schoolers"". I get that a lot of anime involve high schoolers saving the world against eldritch gods and 1000-year-old vampires and shit but a 16-year-old and a nine-year-old are very far apart, it was kind of weird to me.Like, it wasn't the worst thing you could watch. I got through it, I guess. I wasn't really actively offended by anything, it's just... not an entertaining show?"
Tengoku Daimakyou,"If you stopped me at episode 3 of this anime and asked me how it was, I would have emphatically told you Heavenly Delusion was incredibly underrated. Now... after the trainwreck of poorly handled sexual abuse, irrelevant side plots, and mediocre world building, I can emphatically tell you the true ""delusion"" here is the praise that gets heaped onto this show.Heavenly Delusion follows a double narrative, starting with two MCs, Maru and Kiruko, post-apocalyptic survivors journeying to find ""heaven"". Up until at least episode 3, Maru and Kiruko's storyline was pretty interesting. The two have a lot of nice, easy-going banter, and the fight...scenes showcasing their abilities had great animation and composition. Continuing on with this storyline, we get a bit of backstory into Kiruko which had a LOT of potential to be huge for her character development. However, it's just pushed aside to make way for weird sexual jokes and innuendos. Maru and Kiruko had solid chemistry already, but the writers just had to add this unnecessary element of sexual tension. Okay... they're children. So this ended up killing my enjoyment, and then the plot tried to be emotional, but of course circled back to having subtle sexual undertones.The other narrative is about this group of children who live in a technologically advanced nursery with little knowledge of the outside world. This nursery is presumably the ""heaven"" the survivors are looking for, but who knows, because the anime never explained any of these things. I cannot stress how incredibly dull and downright problematic this storyline is. Tokio, the narrator, has got to be the most boring and bland person to ever appear in anime. She literally has no purpose except as an excuse for the writers to shoehorn in *MORE* sexual tension between children. The sexual elements are thoroughly irrelevant to the main point of this narrative, which is to provide worldbuilding to contrast the survivors of the other storyline. The entire nursery narrative as a whole is pointless, presented in a way that is obnoxiously tedious and uninspired. Among all the children, none of them have virtually any redeeming factor that makes them likeable (except one guy - but then we get sexual tension *again*). I could somewhat see the direction, but the writers wasted so much time on these annoying ass children. At this point, I just had to drop this series because yikes I did not ask for this.If they had cut out all these depictions of sexual assault and abuse, and focused purely on Maru and Kiruko exploring the world, I could have given this show a solid 7. I adore the art being a combination of the post-apocalyptic overgrown aesthetic with simply drawn chibi-like characters. In all honestly, this was probably the only reason I clung on for so long. A couple of comments have mentioned that Heavenly Delusion is trying to say something about sexual trauma, and that everything was setting up for the ending. Doesn't really matter to me, cause I never saw it. Genuinely, I thought *I was delusional* when I saw how horrifically these themes were handled. There was just no way that Heavenly Delusion is completely absent of any empathy. It's all played off as a joke, when it really isn't. Stay away from this one, it's not worth your time. Heavenly Delusion gets the place of shame in my list for being the RANK ONE overrated anime with about a metric ton of wasted potential.Final Rating: 3"
"Tensei Kizoku, Kantei Skill de Nariagaru 2nd Season","Pretty good for a low-budget isekai. This season feels slightly better than the first one, with more strategy talk. Some of the plans and stuff are interesting and a few scenes are moving.I do wish they'd use the appraisal/kantei skill more but as far as a tactics anime this is alright.If you're into isekai that have less 'OP protag' stuff and more of regular humans fighting it out, this is pretty good. Animation is meh and kinda still due to the obvious low-budget. The fanservice is not enough to be a big distraction, but unfortunately not inexistent either.All in all this is like an ok...show with good strategy talks (2nd season only), relatively interesting Politics, and moderately interesting characters and fights."
One Piece 3D: Gekisou! Trap Coaster,"Watched after One Piece 3D: Straw Hat ChaseDid not expect this to be the return of the Kung Fu Dugongs but I am here for it, very similar with my last watch in how it would have been so much better if I could have watched it in 3D.This short film is only 10 minutes and uses way more 3D techniques which makes the film very cramped. It was difficult to find out what this was made for but it leads towards a similar kind of roller coaster as a promotional material for it rather than just a random short film. The film was fun...and easy to watch but still ugly art and lack of story (which is fair considering One Piece taking 50 eps to make a short story rather than the 10 minutes that they had for this)."
Kage no Jitsuryokusha ni Naritakute!,"At first this may just look like your standard power fantasy, and well in many ways it is, but it’s so so much more.For me to score a show a 8, it must be memorable, very well polished and have few flaws, this is just that, while it has its flaws namely how from about episode 11 through to episode 14 there is far too much fan service for my taste it more then makes up for it with funny jokes and a simply superb concept and execution.Its attention to detail is similarly notable for example in the scene where Cid our weaker half of...the main character wiggles his hand free from between the clutches of rose one of his heroines her hands stay firmly in their place, and while this is nothing major it is these little details that build up over time, to elevate a show greatly, it’s pacing also helps in this matter it never drags and yet it’s not too fast by you.Now in a anime like this there a two things that take it to the top of its genre, they are:Jokes and memorable scenes, and this show has the both by the bucket load, I shall attempt not to spoil too much for you but the fight scenes are excellent they build nicely and manage to layer on the story and not simply run adjacent to it, and the jokes oh the jokes, possibly the best joke is how serious Cid is about his role as a background character, his dedication to acting that role to perfection is somehow laughable and admirable at once, and it’s one of very few repeated jokes and it’s done in a superbly creative way each time it re appears which is a common theme throughout the show, which we can all appreciate as nothing is worse then a bad repeating joke well perhaps a good joke repeated so many times it becomes a hated joke and you just want it to stop is worse…But what about Cid’s other much more powerful half shadow? Well shadow is the most stereotypical overpowered character imaginable so much so that even he himself is unaware of how much control he has over the world around him, an example is how he credits his seven shadows for the ‘inventions’ and ‘discovers’ which they ripped straight from his wisdom, which leads to some great scenes and pleasant jokes.In conclusion for me, this show sums up why I love anime as a medium, something of this scale and description would never be possible otherwise and that would be a terrible loss, thus I am giving The Eminence in Shadows a 8/10 a great score."
Sousou no Frieren,"The first 17 episodes of this show are fantastic. Very reminiscent of adventure shows I really enjoyed like Kino's Journey and Girls' Last Tour. Was a big fan of the show essentially being these characters going on a bunch of sidequests in the midst of a much bigger journey. Even then, when the action comes in, it's done mostly very intelligently and doesn't focus too much on the predictable tropes you'd expect.Then you get into the Mage Exam arc which focuses way too much on combat, by far the weakest element of the show. I wasn't really a fan of how it expanded on...how magic worked, because it ultimately just felt like My Hero Academia bullshit to me. My powers are that I can control water! I can use ice! I can use empathy... whatever that means! This is where that dreaded shounen tag rears its ugly head and the show starts to drag a bit. You get this sudden introduction of a bunch of relatively forgettable characters fighting each other only to stop for 20 minutes to explain their magic or their backgrounds or whatever. Some of them are okay, but for the most part I just really didn't care.Luckily, this is only truly bad during the dumb bird catching episodes. The dungeon crawling stuff and fighting the replicas was at least a bit more interesting and fun. I just don't think this mage exam stuff needed to last this long. It's a massive genre and tone shift from what the show initially sets itself up as. I didn't hate it or anything, it just felt much more like typical shounen slop, so I was disappointed that it went in this direction.With all that being said, a part of me almost wants to give this a lower score, but it does what it does extremely well. Animation is great throughout, music is exceptional, and it manages to balance its drama and comedy pretty well. I can see why a lot of people like this. Don't really get why it hit #1, but hey recency bias gonna recency bias. It is a great show, but far from a masterpiece."
Shoujo Kakumei Utena,"I really don't feel like I am qualified to write a decent review on this anime. So to that end, I'll try to separate this review from any analysis,  because this is really a story that invites multiple rewatches.Utena is good. Utena is a damn good anime, and I'm genuinely shocked it somehow comes in at #360 in popularity.Start with what I'm least qualified, which is the animation: some episodes (The Nanami early focuses especially) can be off-model. However, it's never impacted the story in a way that I think holds any merit. Barring that, the animation is gorgeous. Everything looks beautiful....The direction in this series is masterful, and something that should really be examined. I recommend watching Utena with a friend, as I did, to bounce ideas off of each other at what each little thing means. It's actually a blast.Story & characters are phenomenal. Each and every character is, in some regards, a bad person, with deep, innumerable flaws, and they all end up hurting each other, constantly. But they're still extremely charming, and mostly sympathetic. The cast as a whole is extremely strong. They're funny, interesting, and you just want them to win so bad. I never felt disappointed or disheartened with a turn in someone's arc, only continuously enthralled, only wishing for them to overcome the obstacles they faced, especially towards the end. Utena, Jury, and Nanami were standouts to me. Watching their journeys throughout the 39 episodes was always entertaining, sometimes harrowing, and deeply satisfactory. Utena's arc is a particular standout; she goes from plucky, stereotypical protag, to something so much more, every detail affecting her life, arc, and trajectory.Utena is a must watch. It's a damn shame no one seems to talk about it more these days, even within ""philosophical"" anime analysis circles. The only reason it's not a 10 is purely personal bias, as I didn't feel that final ""click""-- but that doesn't mean what I'm seeing her isn't masterful, in every sense of the word.Also the music is fucking spectacular."
Irozuku Sekai no Ashita kara,"I don't think this anime was bad. However, I found myself not enjoying it nearly as much as I expected to. On paper this anime seemed like it was right up my street. I watched a few videos on TikTok about it and it seemed like something I would be highly interested in so I checked it out. Whilst I don't think there was anything bad about it. I did find myself finding it boring a good chunk of the time.Let me start with the positives:The visuals were absolutely beautiful - I don't think anyone can disagree with me when I say the visuals...were beautiful. The way the animators beautifully captured the world that Hitomi was seeing the rare times she was able to see colors was nothing short of fantastic. To me, it seemed like they were trying to portray how Hitomi wants to see colors and I feel like they absolutely nailed it. It was too bad there wasn't more scenes like that as I feel they could have done a bit more.The soundtrack - Overall the soundtrack was pretty good. I can't really say too much on it as I can't really talk about music in a detailed way, but I did quite like it.The characters - Most of the characters were solid. None of them came off as unlikable which is rare in my opinion because I feel like there's always one character in every anime you tend to dislike for one reason or another. I myself included. This one I didn't feel like anyone stood out as being a bad character.Moving onto the rest of the show: I don't think it was a bad anime. However, I did find myself not caring nearly as much as I feel like I should have. Maybe it was the way it was presented, missed potential or the delivery on certain events. I don't know. But I feel like they could have done so much more and I found myself struggling to finish the anime around episode 7ish as I was growing increasingly bored. That's the problem with romance in animes. They always get together on the final episode, leaving no time for development which becomes incredibly annoying. I actually appreciate anime more when they get the couple together early on so we can see them grow.Another gripe I had was Hitomi the main girl was pretty lifeless. That's the best way I can describe her. She had probably the blandest personality I've ever seen in any anime. She speaks with a monotone voice, she very rarely changes her emotion. It just comes off as boring. I don't think she's a bad character, but I do think she's about as exciting as Tofu. It wouldn't have killed her to be a little more enthusiastic. First episode and maybe second I can let off as she's just been shoved 60 years or so into the past, around nobody she knows, and she feels depressed about not being able to see the fireworks. But the other 11 episodes I can't really think of many moments if any where she seemed happy. Just pretty dull overall.Decent watch, but it wasn't for me6/10"
Mairimashita! Iruma-kun 3rd Season,This anime is my favorite recent anime I've discovered. This show to me in my opinion blows MHA out of the water mainly because the entire class get character development and its just so god damn wholesome. Its impossible not to smile watching this show. As an anime only watcher the whole premise of Iruma-kun becoming the nexr demon king I assume is very interesting and I can't wait to see how it will all unfold. The side characters from the first two seasons get to shine more in this season and we learn more about everyones strengths this season. I can't wait for season...4!
"Tensei shitara Dainana Ouji Datta node, Kimama ni Majutsu wo Kiwamemasu","If you're cool with getting put on a list, this will be an enjoyable watch.On the positive side, the animation is absolutely incredible. The animators took the approach of using chibi characters both for dramatic effect and to allow more time to draw fight scenes. This decision gives more of a ""Saturday morning cartoon"" feel than some might prefer, though it isn't terribly off-putting. On the flip side, fight scenes are beautiful, with special attention being given to the usage of magic in combat.On the negative, just about every woman in this anime has googly-eyes for the 10 year old MC. It's very...surprising that this anime hasn't received the Harem tag, given how often the MC ends up buried in the chest of some new or returning woman.Overall, it's like if Michael Bay and Jeffrey Epstein got together to redo High School DxD."
Pluto,"A brilliant masterpiece with mystery and melodrama that you need to watch.The show is set in a future where the robotic technology is very advanced. Robots have rights and live alongside humans. Amidst all this there is a political strife going around the world and someone kills one of the most advanced robots. Detective Gesicht, another most advanced robot takes the lead on the case. Soon the first tradedgy is followed by a list of murders, both human and robot, with horns left at the crime scene. The political landscape takes its inspiration from real world scenarios. Also, the show keeps you on your toes...as there are no main characters, so to speak. Some of the moments are very heartfelt and they build up the tension, the slow burn, until its finally released. There is a point where it feels all is lost. But eventually the show ends with a very satisfying ending."
Rokka no Yuusha,"This anime is REALLY good, I would recommend it to everyone who likes mystery and/or action anime it gives the vibes of Death Note or Tomodachi Game.There’s a seventh, meaning one of them is a fake. The show’s beautiful jungle setting and clever mystery keep you hooked, and the characters are fun to figure out.It quickly became one of the anime I was really looking forward to…It is interesting how it made this atmosphere that always made people wanting to come back for more, that's what a good mystery doesIf you’re into fantasy with a bit of a mystery vibe and don’t mind some loose...ends it’s a fun watch."
Dies Irae,"This anime makes absolutely no sense. Random events without phasing are interwoven with random monologues that sound like deep philosophical musings that in reality have the depth of a puddle and lead to absolutely nothing. Even the MC says a few times that he ""doesn't know what's going on"" - I didn't think I could be so unanimous with him. I don't consider myself the king of intellectuals, but I'm not an idiot either. And here the authors are clearly counting on the latter. Generally, everything that does not come down to a fight scene is considered unnecessary and they simply skip a few scenes...just so that there will be a fight. The animation is as stiff as at an alcohol-free wedding. In contrast, the drawing has nothing to be ashamed of. The monologues make no sense here and their only goal is to be as... edgy as possible. It's heartbreaking that the music is so atmospheric here, because it is completely wasted as a backing for completely uninteresting and shallow scenes. The anime looks and sounds like a very cheap 3,000-word fanfic written by a fourteen-year-old with the adolescent syndrome. The invented names and titles taken from history, mythology, famous books and occult pastes were supposed to sound ""cool"" but in reality they simply expose it all to ridicule (Zarathustra and Mephistopheles in German uniforms made my psyche a little weak). In addition, someone thought it would be a great idea to intersperse it with loose Ecchi scenes that fit here like a fist to the nose. Until episode 6, it is not really clear what this is all about. Later on, it does not get much better, but I started to catch on that the characters sometimes had flashes of genius and instead of spouting pseudo-philosophical drivel, they simply showed their backstories and presented their motives and goals (which is an absolute rarity here!). Boredom follows boredom and the subsequent fights do nothing but irritate the viewer even more. The only interesting episode is episode 11 because it doesn't cause any embarrassment in the viewer (which is something new after watching the previous ten). To sum up: It was supposed to be philosophical, cool, edgy, German, bloody, occult and dark - but it came out boring, embarrassing and without any sense. Blatant logical errors, caricaturally mutilated lines in German, lack of phasing and a complete lack of explanation of anything make it all simply terribly difficult to watch. The only thing that somehow raises this rating is the drawing, music and max 2 stories of secondary characters that were even interesting. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this anime."
Otome Game Sekai wa Mob ni Kibishii Sekai desu,"Pretty good Isekai anime!I liked it because of the way it ended, no cliffhangers, good ending, not an anime you'd want a second season not because it's bad, but just watching one season is enough. The OP cliche is there but he didn't use it for his good, he used it for his schoolmates (which hate him a lot).Story was pretty entertaining and the progression is quite nice too, it made me laugh on some parts, made me a bit sad too. It is pretty cliched as I said, but there are some unique parts too, but I'm not putting it here, cuz spoilers...nuh uh.Art style is pretty fitting, the animations weren't that impressive, but I don't really care about the fighting part.Characters have pretty natural emotions, not very exaggerated, but also not bland, and as per usual MC is clueless about the girl liking him, but that's pretty realistic too (based on experience).Overall, I recommend you watch this!!Why?If you want an anime about going inside a game and being a bg character, then this is the anime for you! If you also like romance then that makes it even better, though some parts are cliched, I still liked the show! So you might like it too! But if you happen to hate it, that's fine, we have our own opinions on anime. Hai! Oshimai!- A"
Kimetsu no Yaiba,"I started watching Anime after a long time and Kimetsu no Yaiba was the first one of this new chapter. New chapter because I realized I now like an entirely different genre.I loved everything about this Anime: the animation, the storyline, the voice actors, the ost, just everything. It made me feel intense emotions and I am really looking forward to the last season.The only thing I didn't like about it is the sexualization of the women (that's why I am giving it a 9), but I remembered that every shounen Anime unfortunately sexualizes women, and even if this is something that I don't...like I really enjoyed all the aired seasons."
One Piece: Gyojin Tou-hen,"it feels off, and I'm entirely sure why, but I have a hunch... is it too fast now?I guess the animation is not entirely new, it's the same one from the original, just cut and stitched together differently. and so, its panels that were created with a much much slower pace in mind, when sped up 2-3x, it ends up feeling odd. I would have loved to see a complete new animation, but maybe some other timeat least for the first three episodes—""Return to Sabaody"", One Pace feels much better. it is slightly slower, 32-33 minutes per episode instead of 23 but covers the same...content and flows betterthat being said, I'm still glad this exists. adds a little color, a little diversity in the ways we can watch and re-watch One Piece"
Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai,"Hello, I think it was an anime that can be given 10 points for the 4th episode and 9 points for the others. It was bad to see Bunnygirl only 2-3 times, but Mai's personality and the ""perverted"" approach of the main character (I forgot the name of the asshole :D) allowed the plot to be handled in a very nice way. Although it deserves 9 points in general, the final episode, that is, the last episode, the feeling of pessimism dominated the atmosphere, which made the romantic anime a little bad and some ""mysteries"" were left unexplained. I think everyone will like it, the...drawings were nice and simple, but I didn't understand why Mai was tried to be drawn like a cat. In terms of the story, it is complicated, you may need to read the same place 2-3 times because trying to squeeze things about quantum theory into romance is like forcing. Again, I recommend everyone to watch it, especially those who want to distract themselves."
Sasaki to Miyano,"If you enjoy feel good stories,this is a must watch. A wholesome story about two boys falling in love, with so many moments that can make your heart melt. It has a great balance of funny, serious, and just adorable moments throughout. If you've never watched a BL, or avoided it because you've heard bad things about common tropes, this is perfect for you. An amazing entry that stays healthy and avoids so many problematic themes associated with the genre.Some parts can be annoying, and it may feel like the story drags on, but the cute moments given by that dragging almost make up...for it. The focus is of course on Sasaki and Miyano, but you're definitely able to get invested in the side characters and their own stories. Watching their relationship progress is very sweet, and if you're looking for a comfy watch on a late night this is perfect, no matter how experienced or new you may be to the genre.If it was up to me, this would be required viewing for every queer youth. This is one of the best representations of what a healthy young homosexual relationship should be. Even if you're straight, or never really enjoyed BL, I'd still strongly recommend this to any romance fan. This is a classic high school love story with engaging characters abd a romance centered, but engaging plot that can be enjoyed by almost everyone. The anime is clearly tied to fudanshi/fujoshi culture, and is filled with references to it, so if you have a strong aversion to that stuff then you likely won't be able to enjoy it as much. But even if you know nothing about that culture, the anime is just as enjoyable, and you get to learn about stuff you didn't know."
Akame ga Kill!,"I came in here with below zero expectations and left very surprised. Don’t get me wrong, this ain’t the second coming of Jesus Christ but it sure is fun as hell. The edge, how seriously it takes itself, the character designs, everything works to just make for a good time. Of course, the biggest thing working against this is the story, specifically the plot progression and character development.There are many small details and things throughout the series that don’t make sense, seem dumb, or just seem to be a vehicle for the plot to progress. One small example is at the end, where certain...characters get tricked by a mysterious lady who they shouldn’t trust at all (we’ve literally learned throughout the entire series that no one can be trusted and the characters know this) but still do and end up getting their asses whooped. It’s really minor things but it’s those things stacked up that bring this show, especially the first half down.Another issue is the blatant appearance of tropes. The pink haired loli, the chick magnet all-moral spiky-haired protagonist, etc. Most of the characters are fun but not generally compelling because they have no real complexity. They generally dumb down to a character trait and some quirk to make it seem like they are original. Bulat is an all-ambitious and powerful night, but he’s also gay. Esdeath is a psychopathic murderer, but she’s trying to fall in love. Akame’s sister is also a psychopathic killer, but she really likes cookies! Don’t get me wrong, I really enjoyed these characters, especially Esdeath, but the show really needed some more time developing the core cast rather than continuing to introducing random guys who are killed off a couple episodes later (really this happens way too often). And when the show did try to explore some complexity through character backstories, it always came through a long monologue that felt more like an out-of-place exposition dump rather than an actual logical place to be presenting the viewer this information about the character.However, despite all this I still really enjoyed the show. The ending really came together and showed us a spectacle of fights and the culmination of the themes the show has been building up. The final fight between x and x, reminded me a lot of the epic final fight of “Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood” and I mean that in the best of ways. The tension between these two foil characters caring the weight of all their fallen comrades while the remaining beaten-up survivors watch in awe is absolutely magestic. The music and animation really lives up to it as well, both having more of a backseat throughout the show but really shining in the strongest moments of the story, especially in the final episodes.Overall, this “Akame Ga Kill!” is very flawed, but it makes up for it with fun characters, gorgeous background art, and a great ending."
Look Back,"I think everyone can relate to the whole “comparison is the thief of joy” thing. Realizing you’re painfully average at something you thought you truly enjoyed more than anything else stings like a motherfucker. At the same time, healthy rivalries born from these sorts of emotions can be the catalyst needed to finally make you take that leap toward becoming a better version of yourself.What Look Back accomplishes in its short runtime sure is impressive, as it provides so much with so little, never coming off as preachy or melodramatic, as films about art, ambition, or companionship so often do. Excluding any sort of romance...goes a long way here, as I really think the main relationship derives much of its poignancy from the fact that it isn’t unconditional, as love sometimes is. Friendship, however, is always earned.Above anything else, what I find really makes this work is the absolutely incredible art direction. Adapting Fujimoto’s style of his original works isn’t an easy undertaking, as somewhat proven before by Chainsaw Man, in which I’ve always thought a lot is lost when compared to the source material. This, on the other hand, captures the (for lack of a better word) “vulnerability” of Fujimoto’s art in a mesmerizing way, grounding it, while also keeping the extraordinary expressiveness and humanity that his characters usually possess.Remarkable music as well, Haruka Nakamura is a completely new name for me, so I’ll eagerly be looking forward to watching whatever he’s involved with in the future.It's a 9.5 really."
Front Innocent: Mou Hitotsu no Lady Innocent,"Hello there. Hope you are having a wonderful day. So today I am gonna wrote a review about what I consider the number 1 hentai aka where animated hentai peaked . But you will be wondering why I am saying this. Let's begin with the review:Animation quality:Ok so before I go to specifics I want you to think about the anime(not 18+ animated hentai) animation which you personally liked the most, your number 1. You got it? Well, that's the animation quality of Front Innocent: Mou Hitotsu no Lady Innocent and what I mean by this is that it has the best , most high...budget animation quality that you will ever find in a hentai (or at least when I wrote this review) despite if you like the story or the sex scenes of this hentai. You must be thinking that I am exaggerating .... well I dare you to go  and watch the hentai right now*. It's not matter of taste like the art style etc. It is from a technical standpoint the best animation in a hentai.Art Quality:Now this is tricky. I personally won't ever understand this kind of people but if you are this type of person that the art style of an anime is so important to you to the point that you won't even watch an animation then I can't be sure that you will even want to watch even 3 minutes of hentai. To be more specific, the art style, the character's design, environment etc is heavily aged and by that I mean it has this old style that you who are reading this might not have been alive yet and from what I have seen rarely people of that age are willing to adapt and properly appreciate the quality of this project. But I still urge to watch the full hentai. And if you manage to find the uncensored version , I guarantee you will explode in more ways than one!!! ;)Sound Quality:Again the top you will find in a hentai. Very naturally recorded sounds and the credit should be given to the godly VAs who did their best with passion and professionalism. I will refrain from saying specifics because they will be very graphic and I definitely want you to experience everything yourself dear reader.*Remember when I said this is the best animation quality you will find? Well the budget was so high that they cancelled ep 2 which some scenes can be seen at the creditsOverall I am 101% sure that this worth your precious time and you are gonna absolutely love it . Thank you for reading my weird review!!!!"
"Tensei Kizoku, Kantei Skill de Nariagaru","Tensei Kizoku, Kantei Skill de Nariagaru, is an anime that is better than the average Isekai you'll see every anime season these days, but it's certainly not without it's fair share of flaws. On the whole it's an alright show that you might like if you don't take it's story too seriously or go into it with high expectations. The short version is, you'd probably like this as a side watch as it works alright as simple entertainment but can't give you much more as it does a decent job but doesn't excel at anything it does either.Starting things off with the premise and story,...and on the whole it's actually not half bad but certainly has it's fair share of flaws. The Isekai portion of it is a gimmick at best and has basically no purpose or point to the story. If you watch this you'd probably think that the show would've been better if they just removed it and that wouldn't be wrong. On the whole the MC being from another world serves literally no purpose, he doesn't do anything with the fact he's from another world and doesn't even act like it either. This show is basically a fantasy that became an Isekai just so it could be part of the genre. The main focus is on his skill which basically let's him see peoples abilities and strengths as a ""skill screen"" like one you'd see in a game. The MC is pretty pathetic outside of that ability skill wise, but at least he realizes that and makes some attempt to overcome it. However the shows main purpose is him gathering talented allies using his skill, and on the whole it's just ""ok"" not bad, not good, just ok. The show tries to put some back story and such behind every character he recruits and in general it'll leave you feeling very underwhelmed. It's not outright bad, but it's just the prime example of a mediocre to average backstory for every single one. Ars is from a very small domain and his father is the lord of it, and I mean it's REALLY small. So as the future lord of the domain Ars is gathering capable allies to help him make up for some of his lack of ability so he can take over one day. The premise is actually really good, but it's execution of it's story ranges from pretty good to really mediocre, not outright bad just really mediocre.The characters on the whole are the shows biggest strength. On the whole they have a lot of areas they do fall flat in, the backstory and such being the main offender. However there's no denying that they all make for pretty entertaining characters. Except Rosell, this kid is by far the worst character in the show. His backstory is pathetically bad compared to everyone else's, he's an absurdly shy kid who also hates doing anything he doesn't want to do and would almost come off as almost being a brat if it weren't for the other characters. He likes spending all of his time reading books and that's how he got his intelligence, except he makes one REALLY simple animal trap for the hunters and they're like ""you're a genius"" and he gets recruited by Ars. Making matters even worse, 95% of the time the way they make him smarter is by suddenly making all the other characters suddenly get stupider to make his idea seem smarter. On the whole the problem isn't that his ideas are dumb necessarily, the problem is the ideas are more often than not something that anyone literally anyone with average intelligence should've been able to think about doing. I have no problem with characters making smart decisions but when the decision is about something that should be common sense 95% of the time and the show suddenly makes all the other characters too stupid to be capable of doing that so Rosell can seem smart just irks you the wrong way. Despite the stupid flaws this show has, it's characters do at least end up entertaining to watch at the very least although they're really held back by the flaws. The character development on the other hand is actually pretty decent, mostly for Ars though, I'm not gonna go into detail to avoid spoilers but essentially the guy does at least make some growth and improve over time and while it's nothing top tier it's does it's job quite decently and is actually held back by his ""Isekai"" origins more than anything making some of it seem rather dumb for his character.Lastly the production, on the whole it's ""OK"" which seems to be a big theme with this show. It doesn't do anything outright bad but it doesn't do anything great either. The art style is actually very unique and nice to see. The art quality is OK, I certainly felt at times the studio had trouble drawing the art ""correctly"" in a sense or consistently but it certainly wasn't bad. The animation is just OK also, many less important scenes are quite still or lack motion but they do more for the action scenes. On the whole it screams ""low budget"" they put movement where necessary and don't where it's not. On the whole it's not bad and doesn't have any crappy CGI put in to make it worse either but it could've been better. Music is fine, it's really nothing special but it gets the job done well enough. Voice acting is up to standard for what you'd expect from Japan's anime industry.Well that's that, on the whole this show is really just ""OK"" it does nothing really well but it doesn't do anything really badly either, except maybe Rosell. It'll probably be a decently entertaining watch, especially the character development parts of it and while it's flaws don't ruin the show they certainly hold it back a fair bit. 6/10"
Tenjouhen: Utsunomiko,"While the first movie (Earthly Chapter, 1989) at least did well as a sort of ""classic modern"" Japanese fairy tale, incorporating a whole lot of the traditional Japanese folklore, this one failed to reach the same heights. It's not a good compilation, as it ends on a cliffhanger and is only meant to improve the sales of the eponymous OVA, while that OVA itself was also made to advertise the source book.There's barely any point in watching this compilation instead of the OVA, as you won't know the full story anyway, and it very closely retells the first 5 episodes of the OVA, barely...omitting anything (mostly the comedic relief scenes with Kijimuna), plus the OVA has an LD-rip, this is only available in VHS quality.As for the story itself, it's also quite confusing and shōnen-like. While it doesn't ultimately descend into Naruto-tier anime, you can quite soon notice the familiar notes in this tune, like when the main character is only there to effortlessly kick the asses of the obviously overpowered, literally god creatures, through the power of friendship / firing up.Interestingly, this part of the book was a bestseller in Japan, standing out even against the other parts. My bet is that it's thanks to the close integration of so many folklore and historical figures, who would be close and familiar to a Japanese viewer, but are completely alien to us, with their weird Buddhist monikers and inscrutable biographies.In turn, the first movie / book, are a lot more down-to-earth and easy-to-understand, it's mostly ordinary humans against less ordinary humans, hence it fares a lot better as a fairy tale. But in this part, the magic is gone, the whole pantheon enters the scene, and the actually adult themes begin showing up. The show itself also takes a turn to more cruel and gruesome.I will finish the OVA after this, of course, but I already know I won't like it as much as the first move."
Bakugan Battle Brawlers: New Vestroia,"The second season is much better than the first. While the new characters were fine, I still prefer the original cast, which made me uneasy about how the old characters were treated.The pacing of the season was acceptable, and the opening and ending songs were okay, though they weren't particularly memorable. There was an improvement in animation and sound quality, and the voice cast's performances were solid. However, the portrayal of the villains was weak, similar to the first season.The battle system was a bit confusing and complicated, but that didn't bother me much. Overall, I would recommend it if you don't have...anything else to watch, but it's essential to watch the first season before diving into this one."
Dandadan,"I dont understand how people saying this is bad for being sexualized, bruh there literally no secene that is like legitimately 18+ yet people are saying this anime is overly sexualized. All this anime ever did is make some dirty jokes and some normal highschool romance anime elements yet people are complaining.Leaving that aside, the anime has everything that you need to call it good anime.The characters are funny and good, they are easy to read but that doesn't ruin the fun.The animation is good, the fights are mono coloured which I don't prefer.But after the crab fight the fights where good, not completely...mono coloured.The voice acting and audio are good. I find it desirable and enjoy it.If you need an anime to enjoy, watch it."
Parol no Miraijima,"For newer anime fans, I think watching this short will open your eyes as to what is possible in the medium of animation. This anime project put Yochimichi Kameda on the map as one of the most talented up and coming animators in the industry. Paroru has the charm of a Ghibli movie, but with linework evocative of brushstrokes a la Takeshi Koike or Takahata’s Tale of Princess Kaguya (though not quite as painterly and more frenetic than the later). I was blown away by how stylish and fluid the animation was, despite having such complex, unique character designs. Even background movement like the legs...walking in the background of a scene in a busy city are lovingly animated with the attention of a main character.If you are a sakuga enthusiast then you probably already know about Kameda’s work, but if you haven’t seen this early animation direction by him, I highly recommend seeking it out. As for the narrative itself, don’t expect anything more than a simple adventure, but sometimes that’s all you need to have a good time."
Panchira Teacher,"Hello there . Before I begin the review let me give a friendly warning you that if watching animated sex between teenagers bothers you I highly suggest to not read my review or watch this hentai. Also I should advice to not let the fact that this hentai was made 10+ ago discourage you , don't make the same mistake that modern animation=quality . Please take a look at my reviewAnimation:Let me begin by saying that what makes this hentai special for me (and I want to believe the same will be for you too) is how natural animation movements and by natural I mean...they are so well made that you could say that the movements are very close to irl sex which I think makes this hentai feels even more stimulating and erotic . But of course that doesn't mean that everything that was animated here was perfectly done or there is 100% consistency when it comes to quality. These ''not so good animation quality scenes'' won't bother you much because it doesn't happen that often or at least it didn't bother me that much. I am 101% serious when I say that the majority of the animation quality we see here doesn't exist in 90% of the hentai we watch today even if the studios to day have light years better animation tools compared to when Panchira Teacher was made.Art quality:If you are adaptive and know that age doesn't matter when it comes to art, then this hentai won't bother you either but let me explain why I have this opinion especially for this anime. First let me begin by saying that the proportions of the characters are really well made and they are not like the majority of modern hentai that have breasts that have the size of Mars and male genitalia with the size of your entire leg(minus one scene in episode 2). I also the fact the fact the grey and mature feeling this hentai give you and by that I mean the colors and brightness of textures won't make you bling as if you turning on your phone in 3 am with 100% brightness lie the modern hentai.Sound Quality:Sound is a very important aspect when it comes to entertainment and especially when it comes to porn. Since I might get too graphic, let's just say that they have done an amazing job which enhances your satisfaction and immersion. I am confident you are gonna like it.Plot/concept:I will be very brief on this category because I don't want to spoil your fun under any circumstances. The only thing I am gonna say that i really liked the dialogues and the sex scenes were very well directed and not just a dull sex scene and the length of each scenes was perfect.Voice acting:I am sure you have heard irl porn actors and hentai that kinda made you uncomfortable for some unexplained reason and I am one of those who think like that . But in this anime the VAs did actually a very good job like if you are listening a simple well made fanservice anime . Bonus: one of the girls is voiced by the VA who voiced Makise Kurisu !!!In conclusion I think this anime is one of the rare hentai that will make you... do your thing and not just a waste of your time . Have fun!!!"
Kamisama Hajimemashita,"As a fan of shoujo anime, I obviously HAD to watch Kamisama Hajimemashita! And it didnt't disappoint me, I had fun watching it. But to be honest it wasn't the best anime ever.Art/Animation (6/10)Nothing too crazy, the art style is pretty (nothing out of the ordinary though) and I like the character designs, especially Tomoe and Kurama are really pretty and unique characters.Sound (8/10)Reallllyyy love the OP and the ED, they're so catchy! The OP got added to my Spotify playlist immediately.Story (7/10)The premise of the anime is interesting and cute, it's definitely something different than the usual shoujo anime. I liked that it's about...Japanese mythology and found that interesting and fun to watch! But the story line itself is kind of forgettable. I enjoyed it and it didn't get boring, but I won't remember much about the story line after a month or two unfortunately.Characters (7/10)Kamisama Hajimemashita got a few fun characters that make a great cast for an anime. Tomoe, Mizuki and Kurama are fun to watch, I enjoyed them a lot. Though I think the female MC, Nanami, could've been a bit more interesting. I liked her, she was cute, but at the end of the day she was your ordinary (kind of boring?) shoujo main character, and I think that she was underdeveloped as a character. She's got much more potential than what was presented in the anime!Overall (7/10)If you like shoujo anime I'm sure you will enjoy Kamisama Hajimemashita! It's a cute and short show with an adorable cast and it's fun to watch. But it isn't that special, and kind of forgettable after you've finished it. It doesn't realllly stand out from the other shoujo anime, except in the aspect that it revolves around Japanese mythology."
Conception,"This show is overhated, this is no more degenerate than something like Shield hero. Go into looking for some laughs and it is worthwhille.The plot is dumb for the most part but it makes up for it with the pacing. The last episode is the only boring one. Most of the characters are entertaining and there are none that are awful, Animation is fine, except for some of the fights but they are done quickly.Some jokes are quite funny, other times the show is so bad that it's hilarious. Embrace the cringe the way Eminence in shadow does."
Kage no Jitsuryokusha ni Naritakute! 2nd Season,Eminence is Shadow has started off with a really good first season it had a lot of interesting things going on with the mc being very good. What doesn't land as good in S2 is that it's basically more of the same deal the finale doesn't hit as hard neither does it's arcs outside of one particular one with the money.Due to lack of character development Cid is basically the same I had expectations that something will click with him but it didn't still doing the same things over and over again. The other characters mainly the girls mostly stayed the same Delta being...the most interesting one of the bunch the episodes she was featured in were genuinely the better parts of season 2 which isn't a lot the show is filled with tons of characters most of them are only staying for like 1 episode and dies in the next one.The ending did set up a potential for the movie to be fantastic an unexpected twist happens to the world which could be the potential to introduce character development which leads all the way back to S1 start.Tldr: An Okay watch decent action scenes okayish comedy but Season 1 did these things better
Girls & Panzer,"What an absolute joy this anime was! I love it when series present a simple premise and just execute it to the best of their abilities and this is a perfect example of that. It tells you exactly what it is from the title - cute girls and awesome tanks. You know exactly what you want it to be and that's exactly what it is.This anime really has that 80s action movie charm of having a simple and straightforward story that is nonetheless engaging all throughout. Really, it's not anything you haven't seen before, but it doesn't need to be. The story is easy to...follow and the characters are all super charismatic and loveable. With the bare minimum of backstory on them (you get more than that of course), you're already invested in them and rooting for their success by episode 2. There's conflict, tension and excitement and there are many satisfying character arcs that get resolved by the end. There's some surprisingly interesting worldbuilding too, like with all the tankery tournaments and the fact that the schools are all on massive floating cities built on top of aircraft carriers. How do you even come up with this shit? I love it! The pacing is also great and the anime doesn't overstay its welcome. I wouldn't have minded if it went on longer, but hey, that's what the sequels are for. This season I feel was the perfect length and it told its story perfectly within the standard 12 episodes. The fact that this is an original tale and not an adaptation definitely helped too.The tanks first of all are of course represented flawlessly and are all legitimate historically accurate models. This cute and fun story is so well crafted, it can actually trick the average person into accidentally learning a thing or two about all these tanks and what it was really like to operate them. I am both proud and ashamed that thanks to the ungodly amount of hours I have in World of Tanks, I recognized most of them. Hell, I've even owned most of them at some point. The tanktakus out there will definitely be satisfied and will blissfully dream of real women that understand this stuff to the same levels as the girls in here.The star of the show by far is the action though. Honestly, I didn't expect this anime to be as action packed as it is, but damn am I happy from what we got. While some watchers may flinch at the mention of CGI in anime, especially from the time when this came out, here the use is perfectly implemented. The battles are fast paced, tactical and thoroughly exciting. The use of realistic military strategy mixed with just the healthy dose of anime absurdity. It's an absolute spectacle of explosions and steel crashing against steel that is just the type of controlled chaos you expect on the battlefield. The way the girls operate their vehicles also gives it this mecha anime style feel of military strategy juxtaposed with shonen power of friendship malarkey. The way the CGI is handled also gives it an almost Initial D style edge of the fast vehicular mayhem. It's positively glorious. I never dreamed I would see tank battles this good in an anime but I am just overjoyed I did.On a purely technical level, the anime is perfectly executed too. Great, vibrant visuals that contrast the colourful high school life with  the gritty military vibe fantastically. The animation is smooth and expressive, the music is great with all the energetic war marches (although I would've have minded some eurobeat during some fight scenes) and the voice acting is superb. They really did their best. I can't think of a single thing that could be done different to make this better.Overall, Girls & Panzer is exactly what it needed to be. It's action packed and those scenes are done to a superb level. The story is simple, but always engaging and all of this makes for a very easy and entertaining watch. You'll never be bored and the show will keep you hooked from beginning to end, without taxing your mind with unnecessary bullshit. This isn't some deep philosophical quandary about war or society and it doesn't need to be. It's cute girls in tanks fighting for honour, valour and pride. The creators knew what you wanted and they delivered on every front. Their main goal was to entertain and to that end they passed with flying colours. The only downside I can mention is that this might make me want to install World of Tanks again."
The Fable,"Right, this'll be a bit of a weird one, but I'll do my best to put into words how I feel about this show. In short though, it was a really fun anime that got better and better as it went on. Nonetheless, it has some issues. Here we go.Let's just get some of the obvious stuff out of the way. The animation for this series was just not there. All the characters looked plain and uninspired, the posing and movement was stiff and lifeless, lots of reused scenes and no visual flare to speak of. A lot of times, characters lacked expression too, which...is very important in a thriller. Seriously, it feels like for the most part, they did the absolute bare minimum to get the point across. So expect a lot of by the numbers shot-reverse shot dialogue sections, lots of still frames and minimal movement outside of action scenes. The studio can be damn thankful that the story is more than good enough to make this worthwhile and that the music and especially the voice acting did A LOT of heavy lifting to make this come together. Trust me, were this a lesser story, this anime would've been relegated to a dustbin right away.Right, let's get into the good stuff though. The Fable is another awesome entry in the growing genre of ""former Yakuza/hitman tries to live a normal life, but his past keeps catching up to him"" alongside other series like Gokushufudou or Sakamoto Days. It's also great how, despite sounding very similar on paper, all of them have a very different approach to their story and are very distinct from one another and any other series out there. The Fable is absolutely brilliant in the way that it manages to balance comedy, action and tension. There's lots of jokes and many scenes got a good laugh out of me. Despite this, it also weaves a fantastic yakuza crime thriller in there too and both aspects only serve to enhance each other. It's a very delicate task to try and make your audience laugh, while also consistently keeping them on their toes at all times but dammit, it works! The fight scenes are also handled very uniquely, without prolonged exchanges of blows but instead were these physical games of chess, focused on very cerebral decision making between highly intelligent characters. Without gratuitous inner monologues, we get battles of wit punctuated by lighting fast John Wick-style showdowns. In a battle of professional assassins, the outcome can be decided in the blink of an eye, so every moment counts.This brings us to another of the core strengths - the characters. It's often a slippery slope and quite hit or miss when anime try to have highly intelligent characters. However here, this is done wonderfully. Characters who are meant to be clever actually feel that way and the decisions they make are logical and creative. The outsmarting going on is very engaging and adds to the great sense of anticipation during every direct conflict. The way Fable also uses his genius in his field to handle every situation while keeping his promise not to kill anyone is thoroughly fascinating. Beyond conflict though, the characters are also all very charismatic, engaging and interesting. All of them have depth and a mixture of realistic, believable flaws, all sprinkled with just the right amount of exaggerated absurdity to make them slot right in with the overall comedic tone of the story. They absolutely steal the show and this makes this overall very dialogue heavy series never drag or feel dull and as I said earlier, the fantastic voice acting carries a lot of the weight in order to make the whole experience come together well. I mean, both Kenjiro Tsuda and Takehito Koyasu showed up, so we've checked all the boxes of making a proper yakuza thriller.Overall, I enjoyed what I saw from this anime, but there were definitely glaring flaws. The story is excellent and unique and the characters are easily the greatest thing about it, but I can't lie, the really cheap visuals detracts greatly from the experience. The stiff and janky animation makes the emotional scenes less impactful than they should be and the dull, generic, bright colour palette used detracts from the cool neo-noir atmosphere that I feel befits this kind of story. Were this tale less exciting than it was, this anime would've been given no more than a 5 on here and it would've been swiftly forgotten about.My final verdict is that this is still an enjoyable experience overall and still worth a watch, but I'll definitely be deferring to the superior manga for the full story. If and when this gets greenlit for a second season, I would very much rather a different more passionate studio be given the job.TLDR: Божката пука/10"
Chi. Chikyuu no Undou ni Tsuite,"Extremely boring for anyone who isn’t an armchair intellectual. Look at the other reviews, bunch of turbo nerds. It’s just like those super low budget historical reenactments that you get in high school history in anime form.For real tho, it’s a historical drama with very little “action”. If you find the subject of christianity vs science to be unbelievably boring (like me because I learned more than enough about the subject in school) and you can’t care about characters that only exist for 10-20 mins, then this show will probably be very boring to you too. The story, characters, and art are top tier, but...I couldn’t possibly care less about the story, characters or the “think about this” dialogue lol.If you really like the origin of astronomy subject then this show will probably be 10/10 to you. If you want a similar show with a far more interesting story (imo) watch Monster or Pluto.I’ve fallen asleep while watching TV 3 times in my life and 2/3 times were while watching this show. I have to put it under the “impressively boring” category. Maybe I just have the wrong mindset, but I really tried."
2.5-jigen no Ririsa,"At this point in the series, I can say I have honestly enjoyed this one!It’s just a fun wholesome watch! I know that it is quite different to the manga (and don’t get me wrong, I have no issue with nudity in anime, I’ve seen some weird shit) but I genuinely think the anime has more substance and although it’s not the most AMAZING thing ever…As someone who has almost 600 separate entries on this site (I’ve seen a lot), it’s been a fun watch.I will also say the second half of the series has had a pretty good storyline that almost made me tear...up a bit!I won’t spoil anything but I genuinely think if you separate the manga and anime, you can enjoy this.It’s kinda like how FMA 2003 is good on it’s own if you don’t use the manga as a comparison point.Just my take! Watch this if you’re looking for a wholesome story full of dumb otaku culture!"
Karasu wa Aruji wo Erabanai,"I dove into this series with the hope of being swept away, and while it wasn’t a perfect journey, it turned out to be a worthwhile experience. The show offers consistent animation, an intriguing cast of characters, and a tightly-knit group of protagonists. The themes of brotherhood and the ever-present schemes threatening the ambitions of the prince, reminded me of Kingdom.This isn’t your typical action-packed anime. Instead, it leans heavily on dialogue and fair 'strategic' interplay. For me, this approach worked just fine, as I sometimes enjoy anime that prioritize thought over spectacle.However, my only qualm was the presence of Asebi. Her character, with her...lack of depth beyond ""innocence,"" became increasingly exhausting for someone, who values pragmatism in 'this kind of story'. I sighed so much at her presence, I was eventually forced to step away from the series midway through. That said, I recognize this as a personal quirk; and maybe others may appreciate her more than I did.It’s worth noting that I didn’t finish the show, but I did watch enough to form a well-rounded opinion. While it wasn’t entirely for me, the show is undeniably well-written and deserves a chance, especially for people who prefer dialogue-heavy anime.If that sounds like your cup of tea, you might just find yourself thoroughly captivated."
Genocyber,"Going into this, I expected a hyperviolent gore fest. The kind where you can turn your brain off and enjoy some good ol' '90s edginess. What I got instead was a confusing mess of utter nonsense. There is some of that touted gore and violence (which, if you don't like, you shouldn't be watching a series like this in the first place, getting offended is on you) but honestly, the rest of the show is just... boring. The ending leaves no satisfaction at all either, so you don't even feel like sticking it out for all five episodes is worth it. It fails on just...about every selling point it was supposed to have (though MAYBE you could argue the first ep or two make some promises, the rest of the show completely fails to deliver). The violence and gore was surprisingly sparse despite the show's reputation though I do admit, its few scenes are somewhat shocking but that doesn't carry the show at all.Honestly, I'd avoid this and go look for your gore and violence fix from something more competently put together. Supposedly, the OVA was cut short in development but I don't think more episodes would have saved it much, since the existing ones were so damn boring. I do not know why I bothered finishing it and I implore you to find something else that's actually worth watching."
"Hachi-nan tte, Sore wa Nai deshou!","enter the ranks of the best isekai anime, why?+ Isekai, comedy, harem, overpowered MC+ born from poor nobles+ build magic power and adventure+ achieve and get titles and gifts from the kingdomseeing people's reactions to the achievements of the MC is satisfying for me. getting a noble title, pursuing a career in the nobility, to becoming the best. managing the territory.the drawback of this anime is the very bad fighting scenes, that's what made me give it an 8 out of 10, if the fighting scenes were there and good maybe I would give it a higher score, maybe the cause is the MC who...is not very good at physical strength.I'm really looking forward to the latest season, I got a little story spoiler that the MC will be even better and get many wives, so I can't wait for it."
Tondemo Skill de Isekai Hourou Meshi,"one of my favorite isekai anime, the story is light, and always makes me hungry when watching it. the point is this is a cooking and eating anime in another world.indeed the MC is not too overpowered, but the character development is very impressive, the story is very funny and relaxed, very enjoyable to watch.her online shopping skills are very suitable for a relaxed life in isekai, this kind of relaxed story is what I like, especially seeing people's reactions to the results of the MC's team's hunt, it always makes me happy. I hope there will be more anime like this, like the nonbiri...isekai anime.I give it a 9/10. maybe later I'll give it 10/10 when the second season airs."

Isekai Cheat Magician,"This is a trash isekai anime. 2 trash people enter a trash isekai, and become trash there too, resulting in this very trash story.From here it is clear, right, that I really do not recommend this trash anime. I really regret watching 12 episodes of this anime. I thought in the first episode the story would be good, but I was a bit hesitant seeing the rating and also the reviews of this anime, until the next few episodes it turned out that this was indeed a trash anime. It's true what they say about this trash anime.If you still love your life, if you...still want to keep your virginity, you shouldn't watch this anime. You have to take care of your eye health and your mental health."

Maybe other people think this anime is trash, but for me this anime deserves to be included in the ranks of masterpiece anime, maybe if there is a continuation of the new season I will give it a score of 10.(slight spoiler) this is the story of someone who enters an isekai themed Game, the setting of the story is like most anime, namely in medieval Europe, the goal of the MC...himself is to live a relaxed and happy life in his new world, and collect many women to build his harem story. That's all, the story is simple but interesting to follow.I warn you to watch this anime alone and use a headset. Seriously, don't watch this anime with your family members. Hehe"
One Punch Man,"who doesn't know this bald guy, Saitama, you know maybe most people prefer to call this anime title Saitama rather than OnePunchMan.for now I give a score of 9 first because the anime hasn't released a new season for a long time. moreover for the story I'm also a bit annoyed because the strength of the main character has not been shown to many people. so there are still many who underestimate Saitama. that's what makes me upset (maybe this is a little spoiler). honestly, I don't want to read the manga, because it will reduce the enjoyment of watching the anime.does anyone agree that...Saitama is the strongest creature in the anime universe? do you also agree that Saitama is very suitable for Fubuki? hehe just kidding. but I'm serious, Saitama x Fubuki in the story will make me give a score of 10/10.. lastly I hope that the new season of this anime will be released soon."
Kanojo mo Kanojo,"in my opinion this is one of the best romantic comedy anime, of course because Harem is the main attraction, the MC is fought over by 4 (maybe more) girlfriends.I highly recommend this series, especially for those of you who want to have 4 girlfriends in your life, various romantic comedy dramas are in this anime, and of course the Fanservice, lots of perverted things are presented here. I'm sure you'll like it.(I don't want to give spoilers about the storyline) but for waifu (my favorite girl) is first, Shino, then Nagisa then Rika and Saki. while our favorite MC Naoya is very suitable to...be voiced by Enoki Junya, his voice character is very suitable for a funny MC with a romantic comedy.finally, I give a score of 100 out of 10 for this anime because it really exceeds my expectations, especially for the next season, I hope for more and more."
"Tearmoon Teikoku Monogatari: Dantoudai kara Hajimaru, Hime no Tensei Gyakuten Story","Recommended for those who like transmigration/rebirth type anime, this one FL travels back to a few years before her tragic death at the guillotine. It wasn't amazing, but I liked it more than I thought it would. But then again as many other similar animes, you can only truly enjoy this when you don't try to think about the details of the plot - e.g. why the heck does a 12/14 yr old princess have the power to make so many important decisions?Nonetheless, I like that FL's love-interest isn't the obvious perfect Prince Sion, it's actually the not-so-perfect but super adorable Prince Abel. That...alone got me interested enough to watch the entire anime series. So we've got an FL that appears to be super smart and wise to everyone, but she's actually just planning how to not get her own head chopped off. But FL isn't selfish, she does have a good heart and treasures her current life. It's just hilarious how the basis of her being the wisdom of her empire, is literally cuz she's surrounded by either overthinkers and genius people.It's a cute anime overall, great to watch for some relaxation and laughs."
Little Busters!,"Jun Maeda has done it again! He's created another story of youth and strong feelings that will tug at your heartstrings.I'd give it a solid 7.5! The story is really lovely. It might feel a little empty at first, but that's just because you're waiting for the characters to get along! And as you watch, you'll find yourself wanting to keep watching to see how it all plays out.The soundtrack is just perfect for the anime! It has that youthful drama vibe that really delivers what the anime needs. I just have to say, Daamae did a truly amazing job!I'm a huge fan of Jun...Maeda, and I love that he was part of the team as a composer in the creation of this anime. He also wrote the original story for the visual novel game, which I think is really cool.It's so great that I can watch another one of his anime with a soundtrack he created!I'd give it an 8 out of 10 just for the sheer joy of seeing the characters' expressions and listening to the music. Naga was and still is working on the design of the characters for the Daamae characters, which was really helpful. But honestly, he can draw the most perfect expressions for each character! The J.C. Staff studio also had the best animators who delivered the same lines to Naga. That's what I call professional!Conclusion: I recommend this anime. It's not for adults, but it's very nice. The creator is Jun Maeda. He likes to write about young characters. This is a story I recommend watching unless you're looking for something more adult.Just a quick additional note: the creator of this anime is Jun Maeda (as I said before), and he only creates stories with young characters to show how exciting and remarkable youth can be. That's why I said earlier that UNLESS you're looking for a Seinen Anime, this is definitely a story I recommend watching!"
Suzume no Tojimari,"The recent works of Makoto Shinkai can be described with two words: mediocre and conformist. He continues to recycle the same formulas that brought him success with Your Name, to the point where it seems he believes he cannot achieve success without creating something strikingly similar to his most notable work. In this film, he consistently reuses the fundamental elements from Your Name, merely placing them in a slightly different context with characters who, at their core, remain remarkably similar.In this regard, it can be argued, not just based on Your Name but also on his earlier works, that he appears incapable of creating distinct...types of characters. Nearly all his characters exhibit similar behaviors, conform to the same stereotypes, and engage in romantic and personal relationships that are virtually identical in nature.More specifically, the characters in this story feel particularly shallow. Secondary characters often act in ways that are blatantly convenient, serving only to advance the plot or benefit the protagonists and their relationship. Certain characters even completely abandon their initial goals or beliefs to achieve this purpose, creating a rather cheap and forced sense of drama in the process. Furthermore, the animistic or pantheistic portrayal of nature as a major source of trouble, a recurring theme in Shinkai's works, feels overused and, at this point, renders his narratives bland and lacking in depth. The same can also be said about his tendency to incorporate time-travel elements into his works, even if they make little or no sense in the context of the story presented (something that happens in Suzume).That said, the film offers an odd viewing experience. Despite its flaws, it can occasionally be entertaining, though at other times it feels overly long and quite childish. However, as with all Makoto Shinkai films, the visual and musical aspects are impeccable (almost hypnotic, I’d say) featuring beautiful, fluid designs for the world and its characters.In conclusion, although I did not enjoy the film and believe it could have been much better, I can understand why some people might find it appealing. I might recommend it to someone with two hours to spare and no better options than watching a rather melodramatic film."
Kaijuu 8-gou,"Good watch.At first it feels a little corny - just another powerless MC that turns into a monster and suddenly is super strong, and since he's the main protagonist - he is the hero of the show, the protector of humanity. No big deal. The catchy point is that other supporting characters also seem to have some more developed backgrounds, some of which were not fully mentioned in the anime yet.If you're a fan of cool looking fights, MCs always saving the day, etc. - then this is just the anime for you!If you're a fan of suspense - give it a full watch! ""Spoiler""...not spoiler, this is obviously just a small part of something bigger, or so it seems. This is a great way to get into the setting of the world as the author shows us the REAL deal (later on in the next season).GREAT MUSIC, not just the opening and ending (which are also great, of course!) but the sfx and mid-fight songs, too!"
Tengoku Daimakyou,"This is one of the greatest anime ever created, thats it.Very rarely do you find an anime story with a concept so captivating, a score so entrancing, characters so interesting and animation so beautiful. IG have really been on the top of their game with banger project after banger project and just like their last few works, they've struck diamond once again.Tengoku daimakyo follows parallel plot lines/events that are differed by timeline, and as you gradually relieve a mysterious past, the onslaught of the present is thrust upon you. The world is so empty yet so alive, the mysteries that you feel you can wrap...your head around are still growing and the characters...The characters steal the show, from snarky remarks, comedic bits to absolutely gut wrenching scenes. I laughed, cheered and cried all while watching this show. Not once did I feel bored, not once did I want to watch something else. The show was absolutely perfect.The mystery however, is only beginning and as the manga moves along and the studio eventually adapts a second season, I WILL BE SEATED !"
91 Days,"this was the first anime that i complete in one set, (the last too).its not that bad of an anime, it just doesnt have a point, for me it just 6 episodes, the first 3 and the last 3, all episodes in between doesnt have any point at all, just there to make the anime 12 episodes, they arent bad, but the they could at least try make it for purpose, not for filling a space, Angelo isnt a bad character neither Nero, but still there is something missing in this show, like knowing more about nero, or angelo's life more than what is shown,...but its not bad in a way that makes you drop it."
07-Ghost,"i dont know what i was thinking in 2021 when i watched this thing, its was just in the first pages cause of ""07"" ,its just bad, i didnt know what is josei genre until now, you can imagine the face when a guy watches a josei anime with weird characters in it and thank you.the story isnt good, the characters arent good. i just liked razzete, nothing else.i wonder even if women would like this thing, would you like somthing like that?, if you are a woman who likes characters for their look, would you like those monstrosity?2/10 because of razzete."
Mecha-ude (TV),"I feel like these days everyone is looking for a masterpiece of animation, art, storytelling, etc. and overlook the shows that are just good. just plain normal good. why do such anime that don't go too deep or far yet still work and are enjoyable get so little praise? this is the same situation for why everyone thinks Demon Slayer is ""mid"", some things just work. even if they don't have that mind-breaking of a premise. in the end, it's just about enjoyment. and that's how I feel about this anime. it's not too long yet it sticks, I like the humor it has and...the characters are fun to watch and follow and I'm in love with the interactions the main cast has. the music is OFC amazing thanks to Sawano san's amazing talent. My biggest problem with this show is that sometimes the pacing is a bit too fast for my taste but it's at most confusing to follow.I think this is the kind of anime where you just gotta flow with it. go to that little kid who was excited to come back home to watch Yugio and Naruto. it has the old-school typical anime feel, which tells of this project's mind-blowing history, it was years in the making, and even if it won't be an amazing story I want to see the vision this staff put so much time and effort to publish."
Murai no Koi,"NOTE:-let me say this first it's not for those who like fast paced things and its also not for those who only sees with eyes but also feels with them ,CREATIVITY next level they use those things that probably anyone in this entire anime industry have ever tried and it fucking works and slaps it even when they have very tight budget.MUSIC for music i have only one thing to say its PERFECT the choices of songs and the main music of murai i have fallen in love 10\10.The CHARACTERS firstly murai my murai is the main char? because he knows how a 17...year boy should act he don't act over smart as his ages they feel like they are real living human beings who are in the same same universe as us plus the the voices match them perfectly.RECOMMENDATION:- I'll definitely 100% very very much recommend this hidden gem if you like to read books and have patience please consider giving it a try.I really want this anime to win any anime awards.Truly a Masterpiece (10\10)"
Mononoke Movie: Karakasa,"So that was fun :)As a big fan of the original series, I went in knowing this would be more of an interpretation rather than a direct continuation, and that mindset really helped me appreciate it for what it was. From the very beginning, it was clear this was a more polished and cinematic take. At one poin at 9:04 I actually gasped. The 3D effects were stunning, and I only wish there had been more scenes like that. It felt fresh and exciting, which I truly appreciated.The level of detail in this film was absolutely insane. However, I did feel the color saturation could...have been toned down a bit, and the pacing sometimes felt a little too abrupt. Scene transitions often happened so quickly that they created an interesting effect, but it lacked the thoughtful timing and flow that made the original series so memorable.The ending delivered in its own way. While it didn’t hit me quite as deeply as some of the original series finales, it was still very satisfying. As a fan of Kusuriuri’s original design, I found the redesign a bit jarring at first. That said, it wasn’t bad by any means just different. I think it helps with distinguishing the movie from the series.One thing I did miss was the calm and chilling atmosphere of the original. That unique vibe was such a hallmark of the series, and its absence here was a bit disappointing. But hey, you can’t have everything.Despite these critiques, I highly recommend watching this film. The artistry is absolutely on point, and it’s a beautiful, imaginative interpretation that’s worth experiencing."
Blue Lock vs. U-20 Japan,"The animation of this season is pretty much non existent. Feels like 5 fps or less. Most of the scenes are just frozen frames with dialogues, and when there's an animation most of the time is just one element on the scene, like the ball or lips moving in a frozen scene.It moves forward with dialogue mostly, you don't see the plays, just see the faces of the characters telling you ""he slip from behind· or something.There's also a very few scenes in which they move like 3D animated and feels weird, they also don't do much in those, move a few steps and such.The...source material is good, so it's still ok, but as an anime does not feel very animated.It's supposed to be one of the big featured anime of the season so it does not live to the hype with this kind of production."
Boku no Tsuma wa Kanjou ga Nai,"Super cute and wholesome! I had a low expectation for the show going in, but I was quickly swept away by the story. Solid 8/10 for this romantic slice of life anime. This is definitely worth the watch.Also, I'm usually the type to watch the intro/outro for a show just once and then skip them afterwards in later episodes. But the outro song for this show was so good and catchy that I just had to listen to it every time.I highly recommend this anime to watch. I binge watched all 12 episodes because I just couldn't stop once I had started."
Blue Lock vs. U-20 Japan,"what a waste, it's frustrating to see this without being able to do anything.i don't think i need to describe the problem here, but i'm going to anyway.we all know that a fanmade could do better, and it's easy to see that it's a mess. the editing is in powerpoint slide format, with colorful drawings on top compared to the manga but no real animation. what's weird is that the best animated moments are the slice-of-life moments. But then, every “epic” scene instantly pulls us out of the immersion. Even at the moment when Rin finds her goal of revenge against her brother...and we understand the outcome, the music gives us a bursting transition I've never seen elsewhere, and I laughed even though this moment was supposed to be poignant. (ep 9)Without reminding us of the previous episodes, where Isagi's only “beautiful” animation is repeated at least 5 times to make it worthwhile. (when a fan could easily do it).It's just sad. It could have been a classic sports anime, but in the end it's become an example of what not to do.i put ""mixed feeling"" because i think it's necessary to see this to understand what's bad. like a kind of sacrifice, what a shame.me who wanted to reconnect with the sport that is football that i hate..."
Tokidoki Bosotto Russia-go de Dereru Tonari no Alya-san,"Gosh it's been a while since I wrote a review, I had a really really big hiatus in anime watching with so much going on in life but I am back and I am happy I am back!I actually started watching this anime in June/July somewhere when it started airing and it really captured my interests and passions. As someone that was isolated and such I have some relation and understanding with Alya... except the part where she has good grades and looks good. This anime has a really great story and I'm also very happy there is going to be a season 2 because...I need more of Alya! As unhinged as Masachika and Yuki can get, they have such a perfect dynamic together but Alya and Masachika definitely win the spot for best pair. The characters all had a pretty good storyline and let us understand each character and their traits. Each episode really got me wanting to watch the next due to the pure suspense they put me in. Ofcourse the anime was really cute as well, the interactions of Alya and Kuze, interactions of Yuki and Kuze and even most of the other interactions were all really cute and fun and add to the story and characters.Honestly if you like rom coms and a little bit of harem themes I think you would really like this anime. Although not blatant in the harem part, it can be seen little by little. I truly believe the story committed to focusing on Kuze and Alya along with their relationships with the people around them. It's a perfect anime if you want to just chill, have a laugh and get some cuteness overload in your system."
Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R2,"Oh, boy. Just what the hell have I seen today? Code Geass is about rebellion of Lelouch against the Holy Britannia after obtaining a power called Geass (which helps Lelouch to make anyone obey him). Code Geass has almost all the elements that makes a show great. Like great characters, depth, politics and Of Course, THE END. I seriously don't think there is any better Protagonist than LELOUCH. All the characters have some reasons for them to fight, which makes them more senseful and realistic. And it all works together for the end. The show deals with concepts of Rebellion, hatred and Redemption very beautifully....All in all, a great show that no one should miss"
"Sayounara Ryuusei, Konnichiwa Jinsei","Ok hear me outThe anime is generic one but I see it as a refresher or a breather for all the jam-packed action anime for this season, if you want something that is chill, not much of an action but does not keep you bored that much and have sense of humor, like seating on the couch and want to past time and not having an adrenaline rush, by all means watch this but if you are expecting some op moments like danmachi or shadow stuff, I suggest you put this on your list as a breather or if you want to chill and...relax. Other than that, it's not bad"
Dandadan,"Mid, that's the perfect adjective you can give Dandadan. It was praised by the manga fans for being a breath of fresh air, a lot of fun, and a cleverly crafted silly story, but it's nothing of these so far.After the overhyped Kaiju No.8 now we got the overhyped Dandadan. The plot is stupid, it starts with a lifeless otaku getting his willy stolen by a spirit and the femal character been almost r worded by a bunch of aliens. Then they get willy back but...now the balls are lost? Wow, so much fun, for an elementary school student I guess... We also got the...crazy beautiful second female character than does nothing but saying things that makes no sense and wow falls in love with the main character for saving her life, damn crazy fresh writing. And then there is episode 7 (not following the order here lmao), which got praised for being such an emotional episode, while in reality being just a sad backstory for a pointless enemy, even Mid Slayer's first season demon's backstories were more emotional. If you by chance put episode 7 in Death Parade if would be the less emotional and worst crafter backstory of all the characters getting judged...Still, it gets the job done, 20 minutes per week it's not that much of a pain in the ass to bear, decent I'd say.Animations are good for the most part, it got the usual flair of Science Saru but with a more precise drawing style. But...episode 2 and 8 are absolutely awful to look, the cgi is unbearable, and the storyboards are mediocre as well. The opening is peak and the music score does a good job.All and all it's not a bad watch, just don't expect anything that incredible, it's funny something, but for the most part disappointing..."
Sousou no Frieren,"Unpopular opinion:This is one of the most disappointing Anime with such a big hype. I've tried to watch it but dropped it after episode 4. The main Heroine is obviously overpowered since the beginning however she also does lack personality and yet does everyone love her and hype her.The animation is fine and the music is also okay. But the storytelling is slow and everything seems to be repeated.Don't get me wrong, the anime definitely is average however I've just expected more considering it's the No. 1 anime of all time now.I personally can't recommend it to watch for anyone that expects a masterpiece...and who did watched other so much better animes that are lower rated then this one.PS: if you love the anime please don't hate me, this is just my honest opinion <3"
Tsuki ga Michibiku Isekai Douchuu,"I dont usually write reviews but this was such a enjoyable isekai anime. The humour is great, I especially enjoy the fact people often mistake the MC for a demihuman due to his appearance. The mc is more or less your typical isekai mc and the story does follow the route of a normal isekai but it does have its slightly dark moments. Also I must say the music really stood out for me, the opennings and endings were great but I really enjoyed the battle osts they felt so nostalgic for some reason so I did some research and found that they were actually...made by Yasuharu Takanashi, the composer for naruto and fairytale. The characters have different strengths and weaknesses which makes each battle exciting. I wont dive to deep into this anime but I highly recommend it."
Horimiya,"First of all, this anime is funny. I often couldn’t stop laughing, and it’s the perfect anime for relaxing and watching something light-hearted.The story is simple and easy to follow, just an ordinary high school life.The characters are fine. Each of them has their own personality, and it’s hard not to like any of them.At times, I felt like too many subplots were being added, diverting from the main storyline. But over time, I grew to appreciate that it shows different perspectives.This anime is very good, and I highly recommend it. I had a lot of fun...watching it and laughed a lot."
Dandadan,"DAN👏DA👏DAN👏. We are SO BACK!!!Dandadan (ダンダダン) is a manga written by Yukinobu Tatsu, a former assistant of Chainsaw Man author Tatsuki Fujimoto. Damn, can we take a second to talk about Fujimoto's Avengers level manga team? He got the author of DANDADAN of course, HELL'S PARADISE, and... Spy Family. Weirdly wholesome compared to the other 3 manga.Enough about Fujimoto, DANDADAN, by YUKINOBU TATSU, is a masterfully crafted manga following a boy and a girl from completely different walks of life coming together after a chance encounter with aliens and Yokai. Now, given how the manga was received by critics and audiences alike, I thought the...anime, animated by Science Saru (Devilman Crybaby, Keep Your Hands off Eizouken!), wouldn't be able to live up to the hype.Boy, was I wrong.First off, let's talk about the opening. The one everyone knows. It's so pretty despite being so simple. The colors and stylistic choices in the opening tell you EXACTLY what you need to know about the show. It's not trying to take itself too seriously, you're meant to have fun with it. And this certainly is a fun anime. All of this is also supported by an extremely catching and upbeat Creepy Nuts (haha, nuts, get it) song in the form of Otonoke. It's an amazing hook to get anyone invested in the anime in less than 2 minutes.Now, let's say you don't care about openings. Well then, let's talk about EVERYTHING ELSE. Animation: Masterful. It perfectly mixed choppy, lighthearted animation with extremely silky (haha, silky, get it) smooth animation to make an unforgettable anime experience. Artstyle: The artstyle is so unique at times and shows the charm that can be found in the manga perfectly. Voice acting: PEAK. It's amazing. Literally everyone brought their A-game to this anime in terms of voice acting. It once again brings out the life and charm in each character in the Dandadan universe.My ONE SMALL CRITIQUE on this anime is the music. Hear me out... I do not like the soundtrack in this anime. The somber piano is overused a bit too much for my liking and the upbeat Mozart in a certain scene (no spoilers!) somewhat ruined my enjoyment in that specific moment. I definitely get what they were trying to go for with the music in the anime, but it's somewhat offputting and irritating at some points in my opinion. Don't let this take away from everything else that's SUPERB about this anime, though. It's just a small part of a great product overall.Once again, I URGE YOU to watch this anime. I fully recommend it to everyone who can handle some... freaky scenes. There's just so much that's amazing about this anime, and it's really hard to find bad things about it overall. And DO NOT DROP IT BEFORE EPISODE 7. PEAK CINEMA. Just.. just watch it. Take my word for it."
Sousou no Frieren,"Frieren creates a world where every decision is made in a way that feels almost pure—where things are done not because they are convenient, but because they are right. Take Sein leaving the group: no one tries to argue or convince him to stay, even though in any other story or real-life situation, you'd expect that. You’d think the group would negotiate or make promises, maybe even lie to keep him around for their own benefit. But that doesn’t happen here, and it’s so striking. Why? Because it wouldn’t be right to force someone into something they don’t want.What’s so fascinating about this is that...Frieren shows us a world that works on a moral compass that’s not driven by fear, manipulation, or selfishness. In the real world, decisions are rarely this clean. There are always compromises, conflicts, and sometimes even dishonesty to keep things together. But here, everything is so honest, and I think that’s what hits so deeply. It’s like the show gives us a glimpse of a world we wish we could live in—a world of complete emotional clarity.And maybe that’s what brings on this feeling of Weltschmerz—the melancholy of comparing the idealized world of Frieren to the messy, complicated one we live in. It’s like the show reminds us of what we long for: a place where people do what’s right without hesitation, and where decisions are made with genuine integrity."
Nazo no Kanojo X,"it sets itself apart from almost every other basic 12/13 ep romance by actually having interesting  characters, development in the story, and an art style that I really love. this anime's biggest hurdle is the drool stuff, but I honestly do not think that should stop people from watching what is a really good and refreshingly unique romance anime. it is an anime that I would (and have) recommended to friends, and so naturally I would recommend it to anyone reading this.I wish this anime would get a second season, although I know it's never gonna happen lol. the man behind the manga has...long has long disappeared, probably enjoying the money he made from this show and his other works."
Dragon Ball Daima,"Dragon Ball Daima brings a sense of nostalgia to an already legendary franchise and a breath of fresh air by going back to its roots. As Dragon Ball's power scaling kept getting higher, it moved further from its focus on martial arts, and now it's back with Daima!The announcement of a new Dragon Ball project excited me a fair bit since we didn't have much Dragon Ball after the release of the Broly movie back in 2018. It also sparked a renewed interest, given that this is the last Dragon Ball project the late Toriyama-sensei was working on.The prospect of the characters turning into kids...wasn't anything new; GT had the same idea for Goku. But this time it isn't a repeat of that. After finishing the 8th episode of the new addition to the story, I've felt the old Dragon Ball Saga vibe all over again. The adventure and martial art are back. The demon realm and a few other aspects of the story had some new additions to their lore. Instead of menacing villains like Freiza, Cell, or Buu, Daima has some cunning ones in the form of Gomah, Degesu, and Arinsu. We have a new mysterious character named Glroio. The true villain is yet unknown, though so is our hero's journey and how the story will unfold.The fight scenes are more focused on martial arts than earth-shattering transformation. Goku still is a powerhouse and can use his transformations. But the fight is now much more enjoyable thanks to the change in focus and, not to mention, excellent animation. The new OP and ED are great, and so is the soundtrack.The only thing that was kind of disappointing was the slow-paced nature of the show. There hasn't been a lot of fighting so far in the show. Considering it's just the beginning of the adventure, I'm interested to see how it goes. Since Daima is focused on a new adventure and doesn't require the viewers to watch the old series, it can be a great way to get into the world of Dragon Ball.Toriyama-sensei's last work turned out to be exactly what defined Dragon Ball in the past. The new adventure of Goku is exciting, has good world building, a bunch of new and interesting characters, new additions to Dragon Ball's lore, and only time will tell what's more!"
Higashi no Eden Movie II: Paradise Lost,"While it did come to a reasonable conclusion, Eden of The East the Movie II: Paradise Lost did not capture the same excitement and intrigue as the first season. The production quality remained consistent, but the writing felt as unsubstantial as the first movie. There was little time to produce acceptable resolutions to many of the characters introduced throughout, in addition to giving few answers to the questions presented. All of the same positives are here, but the slow narrative decline led to a realistic but mostly unsatisfying outcome. It is worth experiencing the conclusion, but do not expect the same highs as previously seen."
Hai to Gensou no Grimgar,"FRIEREN vibe like !!I really loved Grimgar, the secenry, the characters evolution and introspection, the slow rythm, the realism (finally an anime that shows how hard and dangerous fighting gobelins can be), the universe seems very rich, I really wished they made a second season, I will def buy the manga.It will really drag you into its universe and quickly make you attach to the different characters.I think it didn't get the hype it deserved in 2015, but now we've got a lot of different isekai, this one clearly stands out and should definitely be rewatched. It could be compared to the Frieren vibe,...poetic, slow, but we dramatic well mastered scenes."
Shiguang Dailiren II,"Another banger.**Please be sure to watch season 1 before reading this.**It's not perfect, but pretty darn close. One thing this does so well, is immediately capsulate your attention, and then give you plot twists.All BS aside (blah blah, it's Chinese, best Chinese anime ever) can we just focus on what we watched lol. It was fantastic. The art continues from season 1, which was just so refreshing. From coloring, animation, fighting, and frame rate - you will very likely enjoy it. Let's talk about the plot twists, seemingly at every corner. This anime does such a fantastic job at trying to make the...viewer feel they know what will happen, then will throw a wrench in there. But in a good way. You will think you know the ending, but will be wrong (again). I think that's what makes this so enjoyable, is the surprise effect. I wish I could re-watch this and season 1 again as if I never saw it lol.The story definitely has more references to the past, and specifically, to the new antagonists. There's less of those sides stories for sure. It's certainty different from season 1, but I don't think that's a bad thing. It gives more background into the new characters, and who they are. Less about the mains, and more about the antagonists, but in a good way. I actually enjoyed knowing more about who they are, and what drove them to the way they are.If you enjoyed season 1, you will still very likely enjoy this, and therefore, I highly recommend it."
"Kanojo, Okarishimasu","So, after all my apprehension over watching this due to the negative reception I hear whenever people talk about this show, when Rent a Girlfriend came up in my list, I sighed deeply, shook off the despair clutching at my chest (or possibly just the hypertension) and prepared myself for a train wreck. And, to my genuine surprise, it really wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, or even as bad as people make it out to be.Now, my problem is; I can't tell whether my brain has been rotted to the core by the sheer amount of anime trash that I've consumed...over the years, and I'm literally just starving for any drop of mid that comes my way. This show could actually be really bad and I just don't know it due to this fact, but Rent a Girlfriend somehow gave off the feeling that it wanted to tell the tale of characters that are  human and relatable. It sets itself apart from its contemporaries by willing to be risqué, having flawed characters and explore some more mature themes. Whilst undercooked in some areas, this show genuinely gets the viewer invested in how the relationship between the MC Kazuya and his rented girlfriend Chizuru will develop. It's a train wreck you can't look away from.Rent a Girlfriend is a quirky Romcom about awkward, young love between people that struggle to communicate and express themselves, with a tendency to get into unlucky situations that go from bad to worse, in which they must further their lies in order to get themselves out of. It has all the parts of a show that wants to tell an interesting, somewhat unconventional and unique take on the Romcom genre, with wildly comedic moments and contains a unique premise, albeit with some seriously trashy undertones (whether or not that is a good thing or not is completely up to you). But, before I shoot myself in the foot and give the show more credit than it deserves, Rent a Girlfriend is not a show with a slew of flaws.The characters aren't THE most well written, the art and style, while crisp and colourful, doesn't exactly stand out at first glance (the girls not included), the show lacks a lot of fluid or stylized animation and the story doesn't develop much most of the time. It is genuinely frustrating to see characters not communicate properly with each other, a feat that makes the plot only more convoluted and full of tropes. It has its moments for sure, but watching a situation build up and have characters about to spill some tea, only for some new situation or matter arise and interject itself, leading to the moment then be snagged away and avoided, ran away from or backtracked on is actually jarring and happens one times too many, working to the show's detriment. The frequent misunderstandings, coincidences and mishaps are also tropey, cringy and full of anime bullshit that many shows of its ilk contain and also bring down their quality too. But let's be real here. This is anime, expect anime bullshit.The most glaringly obvious problem of Rent a Girlfriend is the MC himself, Kazuya. The writer does their absolute best to make him pathetic and unlikeable, but somehow manages to show off his redeeming qualities, which are weirdly wrapped up in a suspiciously hard, stale and smelly bundle of tissues. This is putting it lightly considering some of the despicable acts we witness Kazuya get up to whenever we see him alone in his room, or But, to the writers credit, Kazuya comes across a semi-realistic and relatable anime character, with flaws and characteristics that you may see from a pathetic, lonely soul of a person in real life. The same can be said for Chizuru and his friend Kishikibe. They feel like some thought went into their personas and aren't just completely 2-D characters put into the world for Kazuya to bounce off with no agency of their own. Mami, Kazuya's ex who dumps him unexpectedly is also an interesting antagonist, even if extremely unlikeable and her intentions underdeveloped. Kazuya is pathetic and creepy without a shadow of a doubt, but it sort of works to the show's benefit. Let me cook for a sec.Rent a Girlfriend is a show about a young loser trying to find love. A lot of people that watch this show will see his characterization and hate him with a passion, want to throw tomatoes and boo him off the stage. Nobody wants their MC to be spineless, weak, manipulative, pathetic, creepy, indecisive and insecure, or display no qualities or traits whatsoever that you'd want a protag to contain when trying to enjoy a show, yet somehow, this anime is full of these. Watching media is a form of escapism, and viewers typically want to escape from everyday troubles and strife when consuming. This is why genres such as Fantasy and Action are so popular, where MCs are usually the embodiment of our ideal selves. Rent a Girlfriend does the complete opposite; forcing you to take a loser's POV. People tend to not like looking into the mirror and seeing an image of something they dislike, and this show does just that; makes the viewer look at themselves and see aspects of themselves that they may avoid or not want to be. Holding a mirror to people makes people feel uncomfortable, hence why many may dislike this show and its characters. He's a self insert that you hate and want off screen a soon as possible. Of course an extreme characterization of one that is so down bad he makes Zenitsu from Demon Slayer look like a chad. He's an asshole, an idiot, a stalker and may even be his own worst enemy, but this all makes the show stand out in a vast market of Romcoms of similar traits. Kazuya makes for a very hateable but interesting 'protagonist'.All this being said however, the fact that the show is undercooked and underdeveloped remains. The two main characters relationship does not develop much more than each of them having some inkling that they may have feelings for each other but refuse to express it, choosing instead to keep up a charade to appease the people around them, and end up in a repetitive loop, with no better standing at the end of the season than at the start. The female counterpart Chizuru has sprinklings of a nuanced and interesting character, who, whilst being good natured and intentioned at heart, lets these traits work to her disadvantage and drag her into Kazuya's messy and complicated situations while doing nothing to stop him an only enabling his terrible behaviours. She has an interesting and likeable personality, but her backstory and intentions are not explored nearly enough, and by the end of the season we know little about the motivations behind her actions and left me wanting to learn more about her on a deeper level as the story progressed, of which we get none.I say all this to say I genuinely feel Rent a Girlfriend Season 1 has a far worse reputation that precedes it. Given the way it characterises its MC and the way the plot unfolds, it's easy to see why people dislike this show. Its definitely trashy and belongs in a toxic landfill somewhere in the middle of the ocean along with the contents of Kazuya's wastebin, has its cringy and frustrating moments, and doesn't fully live up to its potential in the premise that it sets out to explore, but that's okay too. There are definitely tons of better shows out there that are worth investing your time into, but I found this to be an entertaining watch nonetheless. If you enjoy going to the fairground and hitting up the bumper cars non stop, than you may just be able to get a kick out of watching this series.I didn't hate it nearly as much as I thought, and for that it gets a 7/10."
Hibike! Euphonium 2,"Sound Euphonium 2 is an amazing sequel to the first season which already set the anime up in reputation. It excels in the form of the character development and the bonds that were formed over time though it suffers a bit in the form of some forced drama in the first half of the season. If there's something that stood out by the end it was a message to cherish moments as much as you can while they last before they leave forever. Several highlights were the long first episode, the episode 5 performance, the episodes 8-10 and simply the attention to detail: whether it...be the subtle expressions that the characters had in interactions or the details to the instruments (just as in season 1), it was heartwarming to see the effort that was put in the creation of the sequel. It feels like the animation and some of the angles used in this season elevated it compared to the first one so that was nice to see. Along with the animation, the voice acting was top notch along with a score that fits right in.To some reading this, this may seem like someone glazing a series due to personal bias and I admit it, guilty as charged. However, this anime presents a level of charm, complexity and beauty that can be appreciated and enjoyed by all without obsessing over it (especially those experienced with music) deserving the feedback that it gets."
Bari Bari Densetsu,"Bari Bari Densetsu is a short OVA that's based on a '83, 38 volume-long bike racing manga. The short length of the animated series - 100 minutes combined - makes for a fast-paced script with just as many time for development as the time it takes to read this review: almost zero. This is especially true for the first episode, which tries to introduce the cast to the viewers, however it does this in a poor way, as it everything feels cramped.Furthermore, the dialogues and overall storytelling of the first part felt, beyond rushed, very simplistic, like the screenwriter didn't *want* it to have...depth.Episode 2 was far more enjoyable. Here the dialogues did feel like they were useful to the story, and there was a bit more of character development as well. The climax was neatly done, too. I was surprise it didn't get me bored after a disappointing first episode.The show is told through a very dynamic animation, which is what made me watch the series. I don't know much about the technical aspects of animation, but the ones who do praises the show. The voice acting is not very good compared to today's anime.Overall, however, Bari Bari Densetsu is a huge fucking waste of time and I wished I had spent my 100 mins better. Even hentai anime plots are more thrilling than this shit."
Hai to Gensou no Grimgar,"-8/10__________________________________________________________________Overall, a great anime, the art is beautiful, and the animation isn't bad.But what separates it apart from other Isekai is its realism.Hai to Gensou no Grimgar shows what it is truly like to be placed in another world.There isn't some OP mc who has all the maxed-out skills and women....But one that has to grow accustomed to strangers to live, and to learn and thrive in the new environment they have been placed in.The new ""real life"" is hard and is easy to die in if you aren't ready to live._________________________________________________________________________-I recommend this anime to people who want more realism in their Isekai unlike other that have been forced out over the years."
Kimitachi wa Dou Ikiru ka,"I do not recommend this film.  It's boring after the first act.  It's disjointed and borders on nonsensical.  I would hesitate to even say it has coherent narrative.The film seems to think it's addressing numerous serious themes.  But it is not.   At best, you could say it alludes to the existence of a few themes.  It explores none of them.  It doesn't have the narrative or characters necessary to explore any themes.The characters are extremely flat.  We generally don't know their motivations at all.  The boy is unexpressive and strange. A bird...shows up and starts talking to him and he just shoos it away, closes the window, and goes back to sleep.  We never find out why anyone really did anything.  The birds are ridiculous and overused. The father is dumber than one from the Sunday paper funnies.The music feels uninspired compared to other Ghibli works. I don't have anything else to say about it, because it was too sparse and indistinct to remember.The animation was great, but nothing above or beyond what is expected from Ghibli.I was actively upset by the time wasted by this movie. I gave it a 5 for the sake of the animation.  My viewing experience was really closer to a one."
Nagasaki 1945: Angelus no Kane,"This is not an easy movie to watch by any means. It is a difficult watch that deals with the realities of war. The movie's focus doe not deal with war in terms of actual combat, rather focuses on the impact and aftermath left by war and the scars left on people both physically and psychologically. This is a movie of extremes where it shows through its imagery the different between tranquility and utter destruction. It shows the battle between hope and hopelessness in a desperate situation and how the people fight the battle around them and within themselves. It really shows what people do...in really desperate situations, and how they try cope in the aftermath and make the best decisions with the cards they have been dealt. My only criticism is that due to the animated nature I feel some situations were a little too positive given the situation, but others were handled extremely well."
Gimai Seikatsu,"In terms of visuals, this work is beautifully and well-made. The storytelling is considered good. The voice acting is well-done. All of this is not irritating at all. Although the production took quite a long time, everything is much better than expected.The irritation might come from the story segment that was chosen. I actually hoped to see some sweetness between the male and female lead, but it turns out the content hasn't reached that point yet. The content seems to be in a setup phase, making this anime look like a novel promotion. This makes the story feel like two introverted humans whose words don't...match their hearts, who don't know what to do, and it's not very romantic. It's a pity because the story after this is actually more interesting, and the real romance is yet to come.Personally, I hope there will be a second season in the future, so that the story in this season won't be in vain. If left like this, I think the novel and manga sales might not improve much (even though this work has some reputation).For those who are reading or about to read the manga or novel, the anime is considered very good. It will add tremendous flavor to the experience. But if you haven't read the book, you might be extremely confused by this work."
Make Heroine ga Oosugiru!,"This is such unique romance and comedy, the heroines is losing in her fight for love and our MC Nukumizu relationship with the losing heroines is hilarious that makes me laugh a lot during the series goes on. This show is pure comedy with a bit touch of romantic feeling.I love the OP and various ED song too, but for me the most amazing from this anime is the animation. Such a beauty.Characters : 9/10Music : 8.5/10Animation : 9/10Story : 9/10Easy 9 from me who didn't like too much romance anime now. But, Makeine is really good show honestly."
Omoigumo,"The animation makes me reflect on something that was on my mind a few weeks ago, which is basically (facing guilt and apologizing or walking away to avoid pain). I identified with the protagonist of the animation, mainly because of some things that have happened in my life lately, but still from what I understood at the end of it all, is that both people feel the pain, but in different ways, and that a friendship is not made of a single moment, but rather of many moments together that form the whole.It is a very simple and short animation, lasting only 5 minutes, the...animation is a narrative without voice but with great music."
Ookami to Koushinryou: Merchant Meets the Wise Wolf,"7.5/10 - Great show but just go watch the originalLike many others I ask myself why does this exist when the original is just better, but for so many this will be their first exsperiance with S&W and this show is still just so great.  That being said the original was never finished, and I think its not the worst idea to just restart the whole thing instead of awkwardly finishing where the original left off. This was a fine enough attempt and hopefully they will do the novels justice this time around with the content that is to come. Holo is one of...my favorite characters of all time and seeing litrally more screen time of her is always appreciated."
Hitoribocchi no Isekai Kouryaku,"The anime is a Let's Play style that can be a little grating given how some of the characters act. I will warn that if you've read the LN that there is a pretty hard departure from that plot around Episode 10. I'm assuming this is inline with the manga. Otherwise it is a solid show that you can just turn your brain off and watch.Animation: Expected quality for a mid-tier product. Lots of still frames.Sound: Has some issues here and there but is perfectly serviceable.Story: Expected quality for a mid-tier product. The cuts between characters are rather sharp at times and seem to be...in place just for padding purposes.Overall: It's run of the mill and I would suggest reading the LN's as the world is more fleshed out and many of the elements that are passed over in this are well explained. Changes to the story otherwise feel like they may have just been done to add to the drama aspect, as the personality of the MC is a little too on the nose compared to the free wheeling nature they portray.If you're looking for something shallow, with hints of depth, give it a watch and it'll scratch the itch."
Haikyuu!! Movie: Gomisuteba no Kessen,"HAIKYUU !! THE DUMPSTER BATTLEIs a prime example of how sport animes should be handled , with a perfect mix of emotions and excitement that leaves the viewer in a complete awe.Haikyuu!! The Dumpster Battle is a thrilling masterpiece that perfectly captures the heart-pounding intensity of high-stakes volleyball while tugging at your heartstrings with its emotional depth. This movie is a love letter to fans of the series, delivering a visual and narrative spectacle that leaves you breathless and hungry for more.The match between Karasuno and Nekoma, famously dubbed ""The Battle at the Garbage Dump,"" is the centerpiece of the film, and it does...not disappoint. The highlighted plays are a marvel to behold ,Hinata's explosive jump , Kageyama's pinpoint sets, and Tsuki's calculated blocks create a mesmerizing choreography of skill and passion. Nekoma's unyielding defense, spearheaded by the Hawkeye Yaku and the lazy cat Kenma, adds layers of tension that keep you on the edge of your seat.What truly elevates the film is its ability to balance the electrifying gameplay with poignant emotional moments. The camaraderie, rivalries, and personal growth of each character shine through, making every point scored or lost feel deeply personal. The flashbacks and inner monologues give added weight to the stakes, reminding us why this matchup means so much to both teams.The animation is top-tier, with fluid movements and dynamic camera angles that immerse you in the game. The sound design and soundtrack amplify the energy of every rally, while quieter moments of reflection resonate deeply. funny enough comparing this movie to the current slideshow of PowerPoint lock, complete eye bleach !!!Overall, Haikyuu!! The Dumpster Battle is a must-watch for both die-hard fans and newcomers to the series. It masterfully combines adrenaline-fueled sports action with heartfelt storytelling, earning a solid 9 out of 10 in my book. I’m beyond excited to see where the series goes next. 🏐🔥"
Akame ga Kill!,"I'll start with the positive aspects of this anime. When I watch anime, I aim to extract its essence, its message. In this case, there are things to take away. The struggle for change against an oligarchic central power governed by the law of the strongest, the idea that 'the ends justify the means', the lack of guarantee of survival for a greater good, and the courage and persistence to keep moving forward no matter what towards that end.Visually, it's quite beautiful. It has its quality.Now, the negative part. I think they waste the OST, because it's absolutely beautiful and epic. I believe they should...have used it more intensively, so each note could be fully appreciated.But there's something in the anime, in general, that prevents it from being outstanding. There's something in its dynamics, in its plot, that doesn't quite hook me or make me enjoy it in a deeper way.After watching all the episodes, I think it deserves an 8, rounding up."
Hataraku Maou-sama!,"Note: This will be a review of the series in its entirety.Overview:""The Devil is a Part-Timer"" is an anime that's pretty much exactly as ridiculous as it sounds, but in a good way. It plays with the isekai genre by having a bunch of demons and legendary heroes end up getting trapped in our world, after which they are forced to adjust to the mundane everyday lives of Earth, a premise that's both original and absolutely hilarious. While it's far from being the most complex or thought-provoking anime you'll ever watch, what it does succeed in being is the one thing that any anime...should strive to be first and foremost- entertaining.Story (7/10):""The Devil is a Part-Timer"" opens with two demons- the Devil King himself, Satan and his second-in-command Alciel- being driven to Earth after a failed attempt to conquer the fantasy world Ente Isla and being thoroughly defeated by the Hero Emilia Justina and her allies. Once there, they quickly learn that they have been reduced to the level of ordinary humans, with them being unable to use any kind of magic or demonic power, due to the lack of magic on Earth compared to Ente Isla or the Demon realm. As such, the two demons are forced to pose as humans in order to survive until they can find a way to return to their own world. Assuming the identities Sadao Maou and Shiro Ashiya respectively, Satan takes up a job at the fast food joint MgRonald's (I'll give you one guess where they got that name from) where he befriends his teenage co-worker Chiho Sasaki, and Alciel stays at home to manage the apartment they rent out. All well and good so far, until the hero Emilia arrives on Earth attempting to finish what she started, only to learn she doesn't have any power on Earth either. Realizing she's in the same boat as the demons, Emilia takes on the identity of Emi Yusa, and starts keeping watch over Maou and Ashiya to ensure they don't do anything bad. Hilarity ensues, but it isn't long before new threats begin to arrive on Earth, which may force these former enemies to set aside their differences.As I previously mentioned, the series is basically a reverse isekai- instead of someone from our world getting trapped in a fantasy world, various figures from a fantasy world get trapped in our world, and are forced to adjust to our way of living, making the series partially slice-of-life. There's still plenty of action, but the series puts just as focus on the characters' day-to-day lives, with Maou and Emi working at their part-time jobs and them and their friends getting into all kinds of crazy antics. In total, there are two seasons (three if you count the two parts of season 2 as separate seasons) consisting of a total of 37 episodes, with the first season having 13 episodes and the second having 24. The first few episodes focus mainly on the conflict between Maou and Emi, but it doesn't take long for it to be made clear that this is far from the typical hero-slays-the-demon story that Emi seems to think it is, with things proving to be far more gray and complicated. The result is a series that's almost consistently funny while also managing to tell a decent story.Unfortunately, there's a definite emphasis on ""decent"" in this case, as despite the unique premise, there are nevertheless occasions when the series just can't help but fall back on clichés. This is especially evident in the second half of the second season, which has so many familiar story beats that you could find in countless other fantasy stories, to the point that I almost ended up losing interest. That's not to say the final third of the series is bad, but it did feel like a step down in comparison to what came before it, with the first season being the best for gags and the first half of the second season being the best for general storytelling and character development. There's also the fact that, even towards the end of the series, there's still a few plot points left hanging and numerous questions left unanswered, which makes sense considering it doesn't adapt the entire light novel series, but still doesn't stop the conclusion from being alright at best.Art & Animation (8/10):The first season of ""The Devil is a Part-Timer"" is very good-looking, animated as it is by White Fox of ""Steins;Gate"" fame. The characters and environments are very well-drawn and detailed and the general animations and special effect are great as well. On the other hand, the second season, animated by Studio 3Hz, looks notably worse by comparison (which is especially bad given that it aired almost a decade after the first) with less detailed character models, somewhat stiffer animations and a notably duller colour palette. The second season doesn't look bad per se, but depending on how much you think visuals matter in the series or anime in general, this is something that you could very well find off-putting.Sound & Dialogue (8.5/10):If there's one thing the second season has over the first, it's the music. The opening and ending themes of the first season are both very forgettable and I skipped them both every time, while the two opening and ending themes of the second season, while not spectacular, are a big improvement, with the second opening ""With"" being my personal favourite. Other than that, the soundtrack is decent but nothing to write home about. What's good all the way through, however, is the voice acting. Jessie James Grelle and Felicia Angelle do great jobs as Maou and Emi, respectively, as do Anthony Bowling as Ashiya, Tia Ballard as Chiho, Alex Moore as Suzuno and Aaron Dismuke as Urushihara. The series has a strong supporting cast as well, including Christopher Sabat, Monica Rial, Alexis Tipton and, in the second season, Sarah Wiedenheft. All in all, I would consider the sound design to be the series' high point.Characters (7.5/10):For the characters, we'll start with Satan, or Maou as he comes to be called by nearly everyone. When we're first introduced to him, Maou's main goal is for him and Ashiya to gain enough magic power to return to Ente Isla. However, it's not long before Maou's comedic traits begin to show, as about halfway through the first episode, he has clearly taken a liking to Earth and becomes determined to be the best employer MgRonalds has to offer, something he takes very seriously. In fact, despite being the Devil himself, Maou does far more to help Earth over the series than to harm it and is rarely anything short of kind and courteous to everyone he meets, with even how he treats Emi being based largely on how she treats him, which tends to be not very well at all. Granted, he does sometimes inconvenience Emi for the lolz, but that’s all he ever really is- an inconvenience. Furthermore, we eventually learn that he wasn't a particularly evil person even back in Ente Isla; when Emi calls him out for his past actions, Maou says that back then, he didn't really understand humans, and while this seems to be just an excuse at first, we later see just how much he really meant that, and that he genuinely didn't know just how much harm he was causing. Admittedly, there are some parts of his backstory that either don't add up or aren't elaborated on all that much, but as far as characters in the series go, Maou definitely stood out as my favourite.The second most important character, and my second favourite, is Emilia, or Emi as she's known when living in Japan. Despite being the Hero who defeated the Devil himself, Emi is, by all accounts, a teenager and so has a rather simplistic worldview. This is shown in her interactions with Maou, with her early on outright yelling at him for not acting like how she believes a demon should, and wondering why he didn't show the kindness he has back in Ente Isla, with the idea that people can change apparently never entering her head. Even so, Emi is also very honourable, as shown by the fact that she refuses to kill Maou on the grounds that he hasn't done anything on Earth to warrant it. What’s more is that she is soon forced to accept that the world is far more complicated than she thought, with even her own allies proving to be far from spotless. While she's rude, abrasive and sometimes annoying, she does have a soft side too, which she especially shows towards Chiho and her co-worker Rika. And really, when around the very creatures you grew up thinking were just bloodthirsty monsters and that killed your father and destroyed your home, why WOULDN'T you be rude and abrasive? In other words, Emi is a rare case of a tsundere whose attitude is completely justified, and her relationship with Maou proves to be consistently dynamic and entertaining.Next down on the character list is Maou's loyal second-in-command Alciel alias Shiro Ashiya, who is also his closest friend and housekeeper. While Maou works at MgRonalds in order to make the money they need to get by, Ashiya stays at home to manage their apartment and finances, as well as researching possible ways for them to get their magic back, essentially serving as the brains not only between the two of them, but of the group as a whole, though he's more than capable in a fight as well (well, most of the time, since he tends to end up out of commission a lot in later episodes). Loyal as he is, however, he and Maou do disagree from time to time (as best friends often do), with Maou often telling Ashiya to chill on the demon theatrics and Ashiya snarking at Maou's tendency to take his job too seriously, which gives Ashiya more depth beyond being a blindly loyal subordinate. There's also Chiho Sasaki, Maou's teenage co-worker who has a crush on him, and who learns of his and Emi's true nature early in the series. Chiho serves as the audience surrogate, being the only one of the main characters who is neither a demon nor a human who came from Ente Isla. While this does admittedly make her less interesting than the aforementioned Maou, Emi and Ashiya, and she can't contribute all that much to fights, she's still a very loveable character who serves to humanize the rest of the cast, providing plenty of hilarious and heartwarming moments alike.Then there's Suzuno Kamazuki, who is initially introduced as Maou and Ashiya's old-fashioned neighbour, but soon turns out to be a resident from Ente Isla, Crestia Bell, an assassin from the church that Emi was allied with before the series began. Initially coming to Earth to finish what Emi started (with her hatred of demons being bad enough to make Emi's look downright tame in comparison, as well as lacking her more honourable traits), she ends up becoming an uneasy ally of the other characters, though like Emi, she still has her guard up around Maou and the other demons. While I did like her character overall, she's ultimately my least favourite of the three main heroines, being neither as developed as Emi or as loveable as Chiho. The sixth and final member of the main cast, and also my least favourite, is Lucifer, who is a separate being from Satan in this series, being a former general of his who went rogue. Like Suzuno, Lucifer starts off antagonistic to Maou, but soon ends up taking residence in his and Ashiya's apartment, under the human name Hanzo Urushihara. However, even after changing sides, his personality is hardly any more pleasant, being a lazy, childish jerk who spends all of his time cooped up in a closest and generally does nothing to help his former boss and fellow general, who essentially take up the role of his exasperated parents. Even so, when you examine things closer, he doesn't really make things worse for anyone, and he can be counted on to be a good ally when the situation calls for it. There's a host of other characters, humans, demons and angels alike, but I think I've talked enough about the cast as it is.Enjoyment (8/10):The series starts with the Devil himself taking up a part-time job in a fast food restaurant and only gets more insane and hilarious from there. The first season has at least a couple of laugh-out-loud moments per episode, and while there's notably less emphasis on comedy in the second season, it nevertheless remains fun and entertaining throughout. As a whole, the series maintains a very lighthearted tone, with plenty of funny, heartwarming and awesome moments to go around, and while there are some dark and sad moments too, they are few and far between.Overall:""The Devil is a Part-Timer"" is not exactly the most serious thing ever, but that's something that ends up working to its benefit rather than its detriment. Sure, it falls a little short in the storytelling department, particularly towards the end, and the quality of the visuals and sound design is pretty inconsistent, but this is still a series that's well worth checking out if you're a fantasy or comedy fan, as it's very fun to watch and has very likeable characters.Score:7+8+8.5+7.5+8=39/50=7.8/10"
Kamisama ni Natta Hi,"A beautifully emotional series that mixes comedy with deep, thought-provoking themes about life, fate, and love. It starts off with an eccentric twist Hina, a self-proclaimed god, tells the protagonist, Youto, that the world is going to end in 30 days. At first, it feels like a quirky, lighthearted show, with Hina’s godly antics and predictions providing plenty of humor and charm. But as the story unfolds, it reveals its deeper emotional layers.What I really loved about the show was how it transformed from a fun, supernatural premise into a story that really hits home. Hina, despite her confidence in knowing everything about the world,...is more than just a playful character she’s also deeply vulnerable and carries the weight of the knowledge that everything is about to end. Watching her relationship with Youto grow from playful banter to something much more meaningful really pulls at the heartstrings.The animation, typical of Key studios, is soft and colorful, but it’s during the more emotional moments where it truly shines. The music also complements the mood perfectly, shifting from light and carefree to somber and reflective as the story progresses.The series builds to an incredibly emotional ending, one that’s bittersweet and beautifully crafted. It’s the kind of show that makes you reflect on your own life and the people you care about. Kamisama ni Natta Hi is a journey full of laughs, tears, and powerful moments. If you enjoy stories that mix lightheartedness with deep emotion and want a show that will stay with you long after it ends, this one is a must watch."
Ergo Proxy,"Ergo Proxy often feels like it is juggling too much at one time. There are so many plotlines that should have been fleshed out more, but are instead put on the backburner; the cogito virus being the most glaring. The show is beautiful, with Re-L and Ergo Proxy especially having fantastic designs. This show has an atmopshere unlike anything else I've watched - a lot of topics and themes are explored but again none are truly fleshed out. I do think it is worth a watch regardless. God, the meaning of life, humanity, even racism are all front and centre here at one point or...another.If you want something more philosophical, and don't mind a slow burn (seriously - a good chunk of this show is spent on a journey with the same 3 characters) this is a good watch"
Sankarea,"Sankarea: Undying Love is an anime that takes the concept of love and gives it a dark, quirky twist. It’s a blend of romance, comedy, and horror that somehow works together in a way that feels fresh and engaging. it's a zombie romance, but it turns out to be so much more. It’s a weird mix of comedy, horror, and surprisingly deep themes about love, freedom, and family.The story centers around Chihiro, a zombie obsessed boy, and Rea, a girl who feels trapped in her own life. When Rea ends up becoming a zombie, things take a strange turn. What I really liked about the...show was how it didn’t just focus on the zombie gimmick. It dives into deeper, more relatable themes, like what it really means to live and break free from the things that hold you back.The tone shifts between being lighthearted and really dark, which might throw some people off, but for me, it added a lot of depth to the story. The animation is beautiful, especially when it comes to Rea she’s both eerie and kind of breathtaking. The music also does a great job of setting the mood, from the creepy moments to the more emotional ones.It does leave some things open-ended, and the plot doesn’t wrap everything up, but the characters and their struggles stuck with me long after it ended. If you’re in the mood for something offbeat and emotionally surprising, Sankarea: Undying Love is definitely worth checking out."
Hibike! Euphonium 3: Extra Episodes,"This series of ~5 mins long shorts that came with the bluray mainly attempts to put an epilogue to the main storyline. It adds some crucial extra info on some characters, but by and large the point of this was some extra fanservice (not that kind mind you) showcasing cute moments. The first and last episodes are more serious toned and an episode in between can be considered vital (watch to find out why). It sheds some light on what our girls our doing after the events of S3.The series has little animation (not that it needed to) but manages to tell whatever it was...trying to tell. Must watch for fans of the original series."
Ao no Hako,"I'm assuming it's called Blue Box because the story is 100% recycled. Watching the show is essentially marking off a checklist of every cliche and convention of sports and romance anime. Formulaic shows can be very enjoyable, but the execution here is completely bland and perfunctory. There's no real tension being built up in either genre. The eye-catching animation and character design do a lot of heavy lifting for the appeal of Blue Box. For me the overall experience  has been like receiving a present with the fanciest bow and wrapping paper, only to unwrap the Box to find a pack of underwear inside....What a letdown."
Shuumatsu no Walküre,"Firstly, I'd like to preface this as someone who has NOT read the manga yet, but I do plan to eventually. This anime is actually genuinely really good, and I think you should give it a shot. When you first go into it, it feels ridiculous. The concept of actual historical figures and gods fighting to the death is strange and weird, the designs for said historical figures and gods make you laugh. But as you go...it's insane. Like in a good way. You get hit with emotions more and more, every time it starts to just feel silly again, you're thrown back into it...all. Genuinely a good time watching, and I highly recommend it. This makes me WANT to start the manga, and I absolutely will."
Dandadan,"Hesitant to give my first 10/10 rating but ultimately I think Dandadan deserves it. I will preface by saying I have not researched much on the author, manga, or other reviews.Dandadan IS anime.It is a comedy, drama, romance, action, sci-fi, supernatural, slice-of-life, shounen, and school-life packed into one crazy plot. To me, it seems like the show is trying to combine the best parts of those genres together, and crazily enough, it works. Like think about taking the emotion of Your Name, throwing in the absurdity of Mob Psycho, and adding the action of My Hero Academia into one show.One thing you’ll notice while watching...this show is how Japanese it is. I’m a red-blooded American and even I feel how Japanese it all is. Now, I’m sure native Japanese people will appreciate these elements more but I love the cultural influence on the show because at the end of the day Anime is Japanese.Speaking of influences, I noticed that the author or animation director clearly appreciates film and movies as there are influences from outside anime included. The most obvious one to my peabrain was Jurassic Park. I say this to point out that as absurd as this show is, it is made by smart people who know how to create a good story.I won’t talk much about the plot other than to say that it works because it so damn simple yet so entertaining.The characters in this show are the real stars. Honestly, it’s crazy how developed and unique each character feels after only 1-2 episodes. Even side characters with barely any screen time feel fleshed out and purposeful.I will say that if this is one of the first animes you watch, you may not “get” it or at least not enjoy it as much as a seasoned weeb because it uses so many elements from all types of animes.Overall, I think Dandadan will be the new standard when it comes to modern anime. It maybe a little too crazy for mass consumption, but Demon Slayer can maintain that spot. Dandadan is for the weebs."
One Piece Fan Letter,"Masterpiece. Good animation, a whole new stlye of animation,the storyline. It also feels nice to see the one piece world from the perspective of commoners. I love how they were able to incorporate all of the events in one episode (24 minutes). I also like the fact that we get to see the opinions of commoners about the strawhats. I also wish they could use this style of animation for the main series. I assure you that this episode will fill you with joy. Highly recommend especially if you are a one piece fan. Just take it as a way of comforting yourself since we...will be seeing a 6 months hiatus."
Mononoke Movie: Karakasa,"Best anime movie of the year and best anime movie of the decade so far, that's all I have to say, absolute cinema.Gotta thank Netflix for once, finally they publish some good fiction instead of the usual easy watches like the recent iper mega giga success Arcane that catches its audience thanks to quick drama, flashy lights and costly collaborations with famous rock bands (still a pretty decent watch though).The story is a standard story for the Mononoke series, it doesn't surpasses Nue becoming the best tale of the series but gets a close second place, you can feel the tension and the emotions conveyed...are portrayed beautifully.Visually is a marvel, they kept the amazing drawing style of the of series enhancing it with incredibly animated action scenes and a more bright use of the colors, the scene in which the main character finally opens the sword and starts fighting gotta be one of the best choreographies in anime in the last few years, on par with the Sukuna vs Mahoraga fight (but with a good plot to pair the incredible set pieces).Musics are really good too, wouldn't call the soundtrack incredible or anything but it paires with the rest perfectly.That's absolutely a must watch for any Mononoke fan and for anyone who cares about actually good pieces of fiction instead of immediate meaningless gratification. We are eating good, in March the second movie comes out, can't wait!Final Score: 9.5/10"
Kaizoku Oujo,"Simply put - I love it!Thanks for rea... well, maybe I should explain a bit.If you're thinking about watching this Anime or not, at first you should know what to expect, since reading some of the negative reviews, I get the feeling that some guys didn't knew (I kinda blame the commercial since it sets the wrong expectations imo). However, Kaizoku Oujo is a hidden gem, an adventure Anime you see rarely nowadays and kinda feels like an early 2000's series or a ghibli movie like Castle in the Sky. Also, it's rare to have a 12 episode Anime with a complete story.Fena, the female...protagonist, has to face a typical Heroe's Journey with travels, adventures and dangers. She gets supported by a group of talented fighters while one of them is her childhood friend and gets also hunted by a group of pirates and the Marine. BUT(!) this is NOT a Pirate Anime, but more like a kind of treasure hunt where Fena tries to solve the mysteries about her past.Sound, art style, plot - everything is great, even though I have to admit that I would like to change the ending. The side characters all have a duty to fulfill and are not just there to have more characters. Also, there are some references to the bible and historic events and I just love those settings.In Short, don't expect Pirate action but a great adventure and you shouldn't be disappointed. Just enjoy the ride!"
School Rumble,"At the time of writing this, School Rumble scores 7.89 which is rather decent but extremely underrated. For a comedy anime, this series is a masterpiece from the characters, theme, songs, animation and the lines are so punchy. Let's get some gist of the story.A delinquent high school student named Harima openly gets into fights with other student but secretly has a massive crush on a girl in his class. She is slow-witted and dense, but fortunately has 3 pretty friends who are, fortunately, have higher IQ. The problem is, this girl, Tenma, likes the class nerd.As the story unfolds, Harima would do all...sorts of action to impress Tenma while Tenma is trying to get the nerd to notice her. While Tenma's attraction to the nerd is pretty well known, hardly anyone knows about Harima's crush. Because Harima can sometimes be kind and sensitive, some pretty girls fell in love with him. But that is not the point because this show is so funny that I watch it every time I am feeling down. It has 2 standard-long seasons and the last season is a closure."
Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! 3,"Better than Season 2!The panties-stealing low-level adventurer and his chums have nothing else to do other than making you roll on the floor laughing at their absurd misshapen adventures. This is one of the funniest anime that actually has a story line, which albeit being absurd is immensely entertaining. If you haven't watch any of the Kono Suba series, start with the first season.Art is good, character development is good and most importantly the humor is often unpredictable.It follows well from the second season and the OVA.Story 7/10Art 8/10...Characters 9/10Humor 10/10Pace 10/10"
Haikyuu!! Movie: Gomisuteba no Kessen,"I dont remember the manga version of this match in detail but all i know is ""this isnt what i felt when reading this match"" and its glaringly obvious in the very lackluster feeling i got from hinatas desperate struggles at trying to be ""interesting"" to kenma again.Everything felt really rushed but also at some points really sluggish. The match felt like an OVA more than anything, and half the characters really talked about in this match in the manga were barely brought up in the movie.The movie was great as a standalone if not looking from the lens of the manga but it...felt a lot less like an actual haikyuu match and more like a real life volleyball match where you dont have any personal investment. Id say most should watch the movie cause the animation was beautiful but dont expect anything amazing out of it.I had some hope for this movie cause Production IG has done an amazing job at adapting haikyuu over the years but this is absolute disappointment and while it isnt a bad movie all i want now is a real adaptation for the last chapters of the manga because it only gets better and more emotional after this match."
Highschool of the Dead,"Guns. Swords. Romance. Fanservice. Harem. Zombies. What do these things have in common? If you couldn’t tell already, they’re combined together to make a show called High School of the Dead. From the title alone, you would think that this is your average zombie blockbuster but in anime and… that’s because it really is. This used to be my shit when I watched the hell out of it as a kid. Yeah, it had a lot of gory and nude stuff shown but some scenes with excellent production are what caught my attention. Looking at it now, the animation behind it aged well but the...story content certainly doesn’t. This isn’t just your average zombie popcorn entertainment, there are a lot of problems we need to consider.The story starts with our lead, Komuro Takashi, hanging around in high school. But suddenly, zombies began rising in Japan and they were spreading around the school. With that, Takashi is forced to kill his best friend to join an organization and vow to protect Miyamoto Rei. Together, alongside a few other women and another man, they work together to cleanse zombies out of the world. To start, this isn’t already a bright sight. I mentioned how HSOTD is your generic zombie blockbuster but in anime, the premise alone already proves that. It doesn’t matter what kind of characters you have, you still have the same slay zombies with few people strong enough to survive ideas. In fact, zombie stories are arguably the weakest monster stories in fiction simply because how most of them are cheap and formulaic. Sure, you still have blood and gore around but so do vampire stories, sea creature stories, and alien stories, among others. With zombie stories, you just don’t have much variety to work around with. If you think that’s bad enough, though, wait till you hear this.For starters, the fanservice is bad. I want to make this abundantly clear that fanservice is purely subjective in general storytelling. They’re the type of scenes that are made purely for style and style only. Sure, they don’t highlight a story but they also don’t degrade it either, depending on what series you make. Unfortunately, however, HSOTD really likes to inject boob and/or butt shots everywhere to the point where it’s hard to take the show seriously. This series couldn’t go for a single episode without sexualizing any of its female characters. The reason why this is insane is because it’s everywhere. The show doesn’t at least give a decent explanation as to why this is focused so much. The female cast shows their boobs or butts most of the time for genuine budget reasons. Let’s not forget that it also injects harem elements everywhere. Those two things are everywhere that the show itself might be classified as pornography instead. The fanservice is rather distasteful and prevents the show from being even enjoyable on a basic level.Heck, even if you take out the horrible fanservice, everything else about it also sucks. I can’t be annoyed enough at just how poorly-created the scriptwriting is. The show takes itself so seriously at times. It throws in a bunch of monologues to appear smart or reasonable but in reality, they’re all surface-level garbage. You would think that this show would even compensate for the jarring fanservice with its dialogue but let’s be honest, we wouldn’t really give a shit about it. The dialogue consists of either pseudo-intellectual lines that failed to be smart or serious or straight-up budget Spongebob quotes. The direction is the reason why all of this is horrid. Heck, you can also see some of the dumbest sequences known to mankind. You have characters appearing that they’re on the right but either bring themselves to even greater danger or are just stupid. Either way, for absolutely no reason. There’s no tension. There’s no buildup. There’s no backdrop. We just go from point A to point B without a consistent plan or such.Oh, wait! How about the zombies? Surely those are supposed to be important additions to the show, right? From what I see in my 4 to 5 hours of observation, I wouldn’t agree with that. The zombies are useless. The only reason why they’re seen to be remotely close to being threatening is when any of the characters act useless for some reason. If you want a story that makes zombies a threat and a major driving force, look at Plants vs. Zombies or Resident Evil for example. They’re not anime but those two actually establish their zombies extremely well. PvZ makes zombies not only strong but also have unique personalities that make them memorable. Those zombies are equally goofy and lovable but they can also pose a serious threat thanks to their leader, Dr. Zomboss. If that doesn’t suit your style, Resident Evil has you covered on that front. Even though its zombies can also be mindless, they’re absolutely high on crack and will easily break your bones if you’re not prepared. HSOTD wouldn’t learn from any of those. It has the exact same zombies you would see from most other popcorn entertainment titles.Now for “characters” (if you can call them that), with Takashi the emo protagonist, and his gang of… um… let’s say a group of boobs and asses that possess limbs… and maybe even Kouta, I guess. These characters are one-dimensional, even your typical battle Shounen protagonist will have more development than whatever they have. They’re all walking archetypes/Gary Stus with no personalities other than typical zombie slayers. At times, they’re practically rendered useless when the plot says so. Other times, they make some very stupid decisions when they want to appear “smart”. I would have gone into more detail for these “characters” but let’s face it, they’re so bland that there’s no way you would think they’re worth at least 2-4 sentences individually.If there’s one aspect we can all agree on, it’s that the animation is outright amazing, albeit shamefully. The action in this series is so well done because of the production. Not only do you actually see characters move in a very badass way but each frame is smooth and fits well with the intense fights well. The character designs, not so much, especially the female ones which are solely used for fanservice. A similar case can be said with the music.  I guess they fit well with each sequence but outside of that, they’re not much to talk about. The voice acting is decent. Each voice performance conveys each character quite nicely. I will say this, though, the English voice acting is a superior experience compared to the Japanese version since it brings more entertainment value.High School of the Dead may be a childhood show in my eyes, even if it’s for the wrong reasons since it’s fanservicy and gorey as hell. But as of today, this is not the hill to die on. It’s one of the few anime that is popular for having zombie aspects, but that doesn’t really excuse the shallow and dumb writing while also being misleading. If the zombies are the most useless parts of the show then what’s the point of making them important? You were far more focused on the Ecchi and Harem aspects anyway and those aren’t even very good either. All we have left is some nobodies effortlessly flexing around while being sexualized so hard to the extent of making the show almost unwatchable. Eh, at least we still have the glorious and infamous Matrix boobs scene so I guess there’s that."
Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!,"MAL really needs to do Series and Seasons as separate reviewable thing.I really don't care for voting a single season, so this is for all of it.So thanks to Mothers Basement for pointing this one out as worthy of time, as he's right.KonoSuba is trash. There's no doubt about it... but instead of dumpster trash this is takeaway trash - you know it's bad, but by god it's so enjoyable. It's also actually decidedly quite well observed of humans.Story is per normal a load of thin nonsense to carry the characters and it knows it, allowing the great characters to do the...heavy lifting.  Again they may be heavy leaning on archetypes but they've got personalities, and do all the heavy lifting.I don't think I've ever felt my teenage life felt more than by Kazutrash.It does that rare thing of making you actually care for them.Art is great, voice acting and dubbing both worth your time.Fan Service is heavy, but without it you'd lose a lot of the story of awkward humans being awkward.And if you're one of those self important derpy idiots that cannot accept that humans are always flawed well that's a you problem and must be a joy to be around."
Devilman: Crybaby,"I grew up watching some of the original Anime spin off from the manga in the 90s.You can still tell that this was written in the good ol' days of manga/anime where it was totally all boobs and gore.Now what's not to like with that? Well... I'm old and I've seen a lot of other things and this isn't enough to captivate like it did a young boy.I've got to start with the art direction, which I've seen criticised. It's spot on, capturing the 70s manga style which was much more comic. You can see how the lineage of this traces back to...original Astroboy/Tetsuwan Atomu.Story wise, it's really quite faithful to the manga, which is 10/10 spot on as it should be. I despise adaptions (unless done by the original author) where they take huge liberties, and we've seen in more recent times (well apart from the US where they produce the worse crap possible with Rings of Power) where directors are able to keep their ego in check. It's famous for a reason and doesn't need some 3rd rate idiot inserting their own rubbish that needs the z rate hacks at Screen Rate to be bought to justify it.The whole theory behind it isn't bad - and was an original take back then - it's less so now, so newbies will either hit that they've already seen this, or will really enjoy.It is definitely worth watching for a piece of re-enacted and righted history (the original series and OVAs deviate wildly from the manga and miss many of the biggest points), so it leans into the mangas message that Humans are weak trash, as we're currently seeing around the world. Ah well..."
No Guns Life,"Life's too short for mediocre anime.So in my new ""If ain't good dump"" this is the first to get dumped, and I sat through Devilman Crybaby before this...This was stuck on my list at some point due to it's above 7 rating, which has in more recent times dropped below 7. This is correct, it's not a Good piece of media, but from my view it's not even a 6 ""Fine"".There's nothing wrong with the animation, voice acting, dub etc... it's just... well the story is boring, treads old ground having been done many times before, and lacks nuance. Now sometimes there's enough...uniqueness elsewhere that these things can be forgiven but as a package this just misses the mark. And for all this, it must be doing something right as it's not a Bad anime.It may be great for people new to Anime, but it's not for someone in their 4th decade, and looking through the reviews of those that think it's great or bad seems to justify this. All the great reviews are from people who've not reviewed and recent acounts. Will be one of those they look back on and go ""oh why did I think so highly""."
Bartender: Kami no Glass,"The Cocktail Is NeutralIt's not a bad experience there was never a moment I was bored, that I thought  the characters were unbearable, and it also wasn't a super good experience because I didn't really care about the character.  the pacing was very slow and relaxing which I think is the point, but I just begin to be in the zone of relaxing.Soothing people's nerves talking about drinks and their history just so relaxing, but I needed some more texture some more uncomfortable they almost no drama. There is drama but they are so good at solving it that it's gone so fast...that it doesn't feel like it got any depth to it.The biggest thing I like about the show is that we are actually watching adults having conversations about adults topics, we are not in a goddamn high school, That is the thing that helped the most even when I fought that it was not the most interesting, at least it was not in high school.I like the character designs, They're almost no animation, but when it's show about people talking, You don't really need it, It's just I've wanted more of the other bar owner that were on the battle lines instead of the man in the relaxing bar."
Kidou Senshi Gundam: Dai 08 MS Shoutai,"This is simply a very short review.While the story is not the greatest in all of the franchise the artwork is top notch and the mecha designs are great.  Between the visual style of 08th MS and 0083 Stardust Memory the 90s Gundam OVAs are well worth your time.  The music is very well done but sadly the characters are a stuck in tropes of the era which is a shame to see given how at times it is a down to earth Gundam series in the UC.  Outside of the artwork it is more of your average Gundam series, not bad...but doesn't stand out against many others.  Given the director passed away before the series was completed the story does feel a bit disjointed towards the end.  Given the short length of the series it does get recommended as it isn't much of a time commitment especially compared to much of the franchise entries that came before it.  The series is also largely a stand alone so it is an alright jumping in point for Gundam as you don't need any prior knowledge to get into it."
Overlord Movie 3: Sei Oukoku-hen,"The Overlord Sacred Kingdom movie is the best movie from this franchise so far, as an Overlord fan I am very happy with Studio Madhouse's decision to make these two book volumes into one 2-hour movieHow could this movie not display better visuals and sharper coloring than the TV series version, the use of CG is also made smootherThe studio and especially Director Naoyuki Itou really managed to summarize the important things that happened in the two book volumes, and of course with some stunning fight scenes in the eyes of the audienceThe movie scene that amazed me was when Neia fought on the walls...of the sacred kingdom and the soldiers who showed emotions full of hope and despair, really made me goosebumps when watching it directly in the cinemaThe point is this movie is very worthy to watch, especially for fans of the Overlord franchise will not be disappointed.The value of my personal experience watching this movie directly in the cinema is 10/10."
Yeosin Gangnim,"I’ll start by saying that I’ve watched and read every single adaptation of true beauty. I had read the WEBTOON, then watched the kdrama and now I just finished the anime. In my opinion I would classify (based on my most enjoyed version to the least) : WEBTOON > anime > kdrama.The main problem with this version is that it is TOO rushed which means that some details lack. Because of that you can’t understand completely the story and the background stories of the characters. It’s an anime so they could have made 24 episodes and explained everything more deeply.Despite that, this version...follows more the WEBTOON story which is great ‘cause that’s what really annoyed me while watching the kdrama.I also don’t understand why people say that jugyeong’s voice is annoying. Personally, it suits her.Overall I would say that it is a good anime which focus on some social problems and shows you how important dealing with insecurities is.I am definitely waiting for season 2 because according to the WEBTOON there’s supposed to be one."
Kimetsu no Yaiba,"Honestly, this show is quite bad. None of the characters are likeable, and they all have little to no development. The only emotion this show tries to convey is sadness and grief, which it does quite poorly. The writing is lazy, and the only pro to this anime is the production quality. One of my biggest issues are the side characters. Zenitsu is an annoying brat who suddenly becomes powerful when he falls asleep. Wow, so quirky. He had room for development, but instead of facing his fears, he just relies on going unconscious. Inosuke is slightly better than Zenitsu. However, he is still a...bland, static character."
The First Slam Dunk,"A review coming from someone who has never seen the original series and doesn't even like basketball. This is a masterclass in filmmaking. Starting with the animation. Of course, I'm sure you've already heard how stylistic, smooth and phenomenal the animation is; it is one of the best looking clashes of 2d and 3d animation styles I've seen, so much so it was hard to tell at times what was cgi and what was traditional animation. But what really stood out to me about the animation, was how it uses the merits of animation to pull off camera movements that are simply not feasible in...Live-action. The way the camera weaves, ducks, dives, pans, tilts and zooms all in smooth drawn out sequences to really put us in the middle of the action with the characters was simply breathtaking. Those sequences, as complex and as close to the characters as they are, is only possible with animation, a camera cannot capture those movements that well. Maybe one shot like that, but it takes tons of planning, rigging, blocking and money and is simply not feasible to make a movie where most shots are this complex. But with animation, the limitations of the camera are shattered. It's a breath of fresh air to see an animated movie, especially an animated movie that has no fantastical elements, use the merits of being animated to this extent.The sound design was also incredible, showing a surprising level of restraint in what needed sound and what didn't. By blocking out certain sounds in certain moments to emphasis the importance of certain actions, it creates a very focused narrative and adds to the hype. And I'm not just talking about moments where they mute the sound or choose not to have music, but choosing when you hear the crowd or how loud they are, or how heavy the breathing is; instead of having all of these elements play all at once, they masterfully choose the right moments and volume to create a narrative with the audio.The writing and editing go hand in hand for this movie. Now, I know the anime, and by extent the manga, did most of the heavy lifting for this movie, but the way the editing process stitched the story together is simply stunning. While I'm sure the manga gives ample time with each character, having never read or seen that, this story was still able to give me the nuance of every character with just their facial animations, very restrained flashbacks, almost all of which connect to the main character and progress his story, and it was enough for me to get invested in every one of them and see their growth. Unlike most anime, where every backstory and motivation has to be explained to us like we're fucking toddlers, this movie gives us just enough to piece together these characters and allows us to experience their nuance and make out own assumptions, without interrupting the pacing with pointless exposition.All of this is the power of editing. I have never seen the show, but I know they changed the main character, so I don't have much so say on that, but I think his story and his framing device for the other characters was genius. But of course the most difficult part of this movie was always going to be balancing the emotional core of Ryouta's backstory with the action of the game. Unlike most sport movies, all of this movie takes place over a single game, intertwined with flashbacks to the characters stories. Balancing these two aspects, making it seem like neither one interrupts the other abruptly, or making it so we are just waiting for the scene to be over to get back to the action, or the drama, is an incredibly difficult feat. But this script is so tight and the editing is so well paced, that I hardly even noticed the transitions between scenes. It all just flows so damn well culminating in of of the most hype inducing, surprisingly subtle, emotional and pure spectacle of a film that I am just left in awe.Shit made me want to watch basketball and I hate basketball. Maybe I should watch more sport animes."
Marmalade Boy,"Marmalade Boy: A Frustrating Mess with a Trash ProtagonistMarmalade Boy is the kind of show that makes you wonder: How did anyone think writing this garbage was a good idea? What starts as an interesting concept—a family where parents swap partners—quickly devolves into a never-ending cycle of forced drama, shallow love triangles, and one of the most unbearable protagonists in anime history.Miki, the main character, is nothing short of a disaster. She’s selfish, whiny, and constantly plays the victim card, but let’s be real—she’s just a bitch. Her behavior is infuriating at every turn. She cries about how hard her life is, but most of...the drama is her fault. She entertains attention from other guys, leads them on, and then acts like she’s innocent when everything blows up. Her hypocrisy and manipulative nature make her impossible to root for.Meanwhile, Yuu is the only saving grace of this mess. He’s honest, thoughtful, and mature—a character who could shine in any other story. But here, he’s wasted on someone like Miki. Watching him deal with her childish antics is frustrating. He deserves so much better than being tied to a selfish lead who can’t even appreciate him.The plot doesn’t help either. It’s just one misunderstanding after another, stretched out over far too many episodes. Instead of meaningful development, we get recycled conflicts and unnecessary drama. The writing feels lazy, like the creators were more interested in dragging out the runtime than telling a good story.In the end, Marmalade Boy is a toxic, frustrating mess. Miki is the worst kind of protagonist—selfish, immature, and utterly unlikable. The story is repetitive and shallow, and the only decent character, Yuu, is stuck dealing with her nonsense. This show is a waste of time and effort. How anyone thought this garbage was worth producing is beyond me. Avoid it at all costs."
The Fable,"Fable has a very slow start to the beginning but halfway through it picks up. I enjoyed the humor, action, and how the plot progresses after the midway point. I think it was interesting how they blended in something so dark with so much humorous content.The animation is a bit and older than I would like, as if it was done on purpose.There was quite a few scenes where it was too dark and even though I could see the characters and setting, I had to focus to do so. The characters themselves reminded me a lot of Hiroshi Iwaaki's (Parasyte) drawing style....It was very entertaining when the plot or is progressed and I was always looking forward to the next episode. Definitely worth a watch."
Hitoribocchi no Isekai Kouryaku,"I've seen many isekai and this one doesn't stand out very much. So its kind of a generic isekai and thats not a bad thing, it has good qualities and bad qualities.The main character is a good person, he avoids situations when he can but if its the 'right thing to do' he'll do it. (dont see how thats inconsistent like another review said?) There's very little fanservice!! Rare to have an isekai without a horny Mc or a ton of fanservice. Like while there's a lot of girls, the Mc is respectful of them (not sure why every other guy is bad though? I...suppose just to get them out of the picture for the mc?? Doesnt really matter I guess)Now, the most annoying thing in this anime is the female characters, THEY'RE the ones who are inconsistent and annoying. Always trying to be the good person and 'protect' the Mc and yet go to him if they need help so end up putting him in more dangerous positions that he wouldn't be in if he were just allowed to leave like he wants to. Sure the whole 'loner isnt alone' is supposed to be the point of the anime, but im sure they could've found a better way to keep him around people without having the girls treat him like he's someone who needs protecting when hes the one that saves them over and over.Final decision: If you want a pretty basic isekai with very little fanservice, then this is fine- just note that the women are pretty annoying"
Goukon ni Ittara Onna ga Inakatta Hanashi,"Hear ye, hear ye, fellow wanderers in the wondrous world of animation! Gather 'round the glow of your screens as I proclaim the advent of an anime so divine, it could make the angels blush! As it is whimsically written in the Book of Revelations of Anime 13:37, ""And behold, three maidens of unparalleled beauty did adorn themselves in the garments of gallant gentlemen, and their charm did cause the hearts of the unaware to flutter like leaves in a tempest.""Let us delve into this holy narrative where the lines between tradition and innovation blur like watercolor on canvas. In the sacred Scrolls of Seductive...Shenanigans 4:20, it is declared, ""Blessed are the cross-dressers, for they shall confound the wise and delight the open-hearted."" Our heroines, dazzling and bold, take on the guise of dashing men, turning heads and twisting fates with every flirtatious grin.Witness the delightful disarray of the three young men, as prophesied in the Epistles of Enticing Encounters 2:22, ""And the young men shall be perplexed, their cheeks aflame, as the maidens in disguise weave webs of irresistible allure."" The girls, masters of playful mischief, engage in a dance of courtship that is as enchanting as it is unconventional.Their relationships unfold with the grace of a thousand blooming roses, each petal a moment of tantalizing tension. According to the Parables of Passionate Pursuits 5:55, ""Love shall wear many masks, but the heart sees true; let not the cloak deceive you, but let it draw you nearer."" Every episode is a testament to this truth, as the bonds between our characters deepen amidst a flurry of winks and whispered words.The artistry of this anime is a celestial tapestry, woven with threads of vibrant hues and daring designs. As the Genesis of Graphic Delights 7:11 proclaims, ""In the beginning, there was style, and the style was good; it danced upon the eyes and stirred the soul to song."" The cross-dressed elegance of the heroines is rendered with such finesse that it transcends mere aesthetics, becoming a bold statement that resonates with the very core of our being.Let us not forget the teachings from the Canticles of Charismatic Cross-Dressing 3:16, ""Verily I say unto thee, there is no greater joy than a maiden who walks with the swagger of a swashbuckler and the smile of a sly fox."" The girls' audacious advances and the boys' endearing bewilderment create a harmony that is both humorous and heartwarming.In the grand tradition of animated epics, this series stands as a beacon of originality and exuberance. As it is enthusiastically etched in the Chronicles of Cult Classics 9:99, ""Go forth and spread the gospel of this glorious creation; let no screen be left unilluminated by its splendor.""So, my fellow adventurers in anime, I urge you to join me on this spirited crusade! Embrace the hotness, the flirtatious banter, the cross-dressed charm that this extraordinary show offers in abundance. May the Doctrine of Delightful Disguises guide your viewing, and may your enthusiasm be as boundless as the creativity that birthed this masterpiece.Amen, hallelujah, and may your streaming queues be ever blessed!"
Mononoke Movie: Karakasa,"Mononoke the TV series, along with the joining episodes of Ayakashi: Samurai Horror Tales, has been, since the late 2000s, my favorite show of all time. It's held a special place in my heart like none other. When I saw a movie was coming, I can't even begin to explain the joy and excitement that overtook me; the painstaking moments of waiting and checking to see if it'd been released yet. I thought, no I *KNEW*, I would love this... Unfortunately, I'd been quite wrong. My adoration for Kusuriuri-san and this series has kept my rating high, but the movie itself, although beautiful, falls short....It is hard to put my finger on, but the art, despite colorful and full of promise, is simply missing some key element of depth or ""SOUL"" the tv series had. In all its vibrancy, it is somehow still bland. The pacing of the animation is almost painful to watch at times - frequently flickering around from scene to scene at such a rate that you never really appreciate any one thing. The colors, which were once a great selling point, due to the aforementioned repetitive and fast movement, began to do nothing more than hurt my eyes. Kusuriuri-san himself seems to lack a certain elegance and refinement in the movie, and he feels as if a completely different character, from speech to mannerisms - not even considering the change in attire/appearance, which alone I'd consider an aesthetic downgrade. Was it silly for me to want for a movie that was a continuation of the show's original vibe, beauty, excellency, after so long? Maybe so. But as a die hard fan of what it has been all of these years, I simply cannot love what this movie is. I am sure there are many who will disagree, but this feels too much like it was heavy-handedly pushed in a weird and modern direction that completely disregards what made Mononoke so beautiful in the first place. It feels rushed. It doesn't feel like it was made with care. Sorry.Edit: Though I still feel the movie felt 'weak' compared to the tv series, it appears the Kusuriuri-san in the movies is not the same character as in the tv series - which explains quite a bit (I was not aware of this while writing my review)."
Dandadan,"They started strong, episodes 1 to 4 are very good, funny yet scary at times. Epic animation, good story telling. But after that, its like they have no idea what to do with the story.-----------------------This review needs more information!Here are a few ideas of what you may want to include:Is the story unique? If it was predictable, did you enjoy it anyway because you like this genre/set-up?Do you think the art style is fitting for the story?Were the characters well-rounded? Did they have flaws and strengths, or were they unusually strong/smart/stupid?...Did the characters react to situations and events in a realistic way?Do you think others will enjoy/dislike this series, even if you didn't? Why?"
Kimitachi wa Dou Ikiru ka,"The Boy and the Heron is Hayao Miyazaki’s return to filmmaking after a decade when he retired from film directing following his prior work, When Marnie Was There. Set in World War II Japan, the film focuses on a boy named Mahito Maki who loses his mother due to a hospital fire. When his father remarries and they move to a rural estate, Mahito finds himself struggling with the changes in his life and not getting over his mother’s loss. Being drawn to a strange grey heron, Mahito gets dragged into a magical world within an abandoned tower when the heron promises he can help...Mahito reunite with his mother.Limiting spoilers where I can, Boy and the Heron is perhaps Miyazaki’s most ambitious film to date with the scale in which he creates its world. For his adventure, Mahito finds himself whisked to another world where he encounters a fair number of supernatural and unnatural beings and creatures that include giant fish and man-eating parrots. He encounters some allies to aid in his adventure, leading him to know some shocking truths about the true nature of the magical world and some of its inhabitants. I’ll just say that dealing with these elements is related to the core theme of Boy and the Heron’s premise.If it’s obvious from the premise for this film, Boy and the Heron’s theme involves dealing with and moving on from personal loss. Hayao Miyazaki was apparently invested in wanting to dabble into this with Boy and the Heron for his grandson to have him come to accept that there will be a point Miyazaki would no longer be in this world. This gets explored through Mahito’s developments throughout the film as while he is nice and obedient toward his family and servants, he is depicted to be internally frustrated with the changes in his life and resorts to negative actions like self-harm and finding outlets to take out his frustrations on. His adventure through the magical world leads him to learn to appreciate what he has currently as he learns more about its true nature. If there’s a weak point to the premise, the story developments for it can be predictable to see come along considering the number of coming-of-age drama films involving young protagonists that have been made in recent years.Visually, Boy and the Heron retains the high production standards you would typically find from a Studio Ghibli film. A good amount of detail is put into showing off the different settings of both Japan’s historical period in World War II and the different areas of the magical world that Mahito visits throughout his adventure. Such effort is also put into the various supernatural beings that are encountered as well. This creates a vivid little spectacle out of the adventure that gets more elaborate with its settings and animated sequences as the film progresses through more of the magical world.In short, Boy and the Heron does enough to make a strong impression for Hayao Miyazaki’s return to directing a Studio Ghibli film with its relatable theme, story development, and the large scale of the premise compared to the studio’s prior work. It can be a bit on the predictable side for its storytelling due to the number of coming of age dramas made in recent years, thus I do think it’s a slight step down compared to Miyazaki’s earlier well-regarded films like Kiki’s Delivery Service and Princess Mononoke. But that minor gripe aside, I’d still recommend checking it out if you’ve been a long-time fan of animated films made by Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki."
Hokkyoku Hyakkaten no Concierge-san,"One of the reasons I love anime so much is that Japan is totally okay with allowing any ideas to become reality? Want a story about children bonding with cute monsters and saving the world? We have a bunch of them right here? Want to play a video game about a little boy spending summer in the countryside doing nothing but catching bugs, exploring, swimming, and making fun memories? Sure, go nuts! Want an anime about girls who sing to heal people's injuries and illnesses? Who cares if it sounds stupid, let's greenlight it! So yeah, not all anime, manga, or games just consist of...shounen series that go on for hundreds of episodes and have nothing but flashy fights. Anime is well known by many for its abundance of ideas, crazy and mundane. But whether you're able to execute an idea well is another story. One such story, The Concierge, completely runs with a fun idea and commits to it, which is all well and good...but one part it doesn't do all that well unfortunately really hinders it from being anything other than just okay.At the Hokkyoku Department Store, animals of all shapes and sizes can shop for whatever their hearts desire—everything from gifts for family members to gourmet dinners. Extinct animals in particular are considered VIPs deserving of the absolute best of the best in terms of service. Yet, what makes this store so great is not just its wide selection of items but its astounding customer service. Beyond the clerks working at each shop, the department store itself features several highly-trained concierges who strive to make each and every customer's experience a pleasurable one. But does Akino, the newest concierge at the store, have what it takes to help all her animal clients with their myriad of problems, or will she be searching for a new job?Based on the two-volume manga by Tsuchika Nishimura, The Concierge is an equally short one hour movie showing Akino's experiences in her new job at a luxury department store and all that it entails. Not gonna lie, the setting is definitely the most interesting thing about the movie. A department store that caters to animal clients, with extinct ones receiving the VIP treatment is a really interesting idea, one that both tickles your imagination and raises a lot of questions. How were these animals even brought back to life if they're clients at the store? Is this some sort of universe where some kind of science managed to bring them back? How are they able to talk? What's the department store's history with extinct animals? All we really know about the store is that it's run by a Great Auk and that said Great Auk's family founded it around the time of the species' extinction. I really want to know more about this weird setting! The extinct animal angle also adds to just how delicate being a concierge at the store is, as Akino has to be careful not to step on any of her smaller patrons, who happen to be smaller animals like birds or raccoons, and considering how clumsy she is...yeah, she's got her work cut out for her.Not to mention the animation for this movie is just fantastic. While the character designs are simple and only lightly detailed, for the most part, the fluid and expressive animation makes them come alive. Meanwhile, the department store is highly detailed in nearly every aspect, really making it appear as the magical, high-class store it's supposed to be in the eyes of its visitors. One thing I do appreciate about The Concierge as a movie is that it doesn't follow your typical first/middle/third act structure. It's more like a series of vignettes, each of which revolve around Akino helping a customer either find an item they need or just help with their issues. These are cute and enjoyable—relating to things like connecting with family, finding love, and dealing with the lingering pain of loved ones long gone. Moreover, there is a strong animal conservation message woven throughout as many of the animals shown are extinct—and by human hands at that. The soundtrack is also pretty nice, even if it's not all that memorable. I do help this tofubeats person/group (There isn't much info about them) gets to do more work outside of this and ClassicaLoid, as I'd love to hear more of their stuff.So yeah, this movie has a unique setting, great animation, a lovely soundtrack, and strong themes about both animal conversation and what it truly means to provide good customer service. I'd have enjoyed this movie a whole lot more...if every character wasn't a one-note stereotype. Seriously, all of the characters in this movie are either just so bland, forgettable, and uninteresting, or rely on their gimmick way too much. Akino herself is your typical overly kind yet perpetually clumsy girl who can never seem to go a day without messing something up, and is so spineless that she literally lets people walk all over her. Hell, when a monk seal Karen (Yes, really) gets mad at her over the store not having a dress in a certain size and openly expressing that she sees store staff as little more than servants, Akino literally gets on her knees and apologizes to her when the fault isn't even hers, allowing herself to be humiliated just before a coworker steps in. Like...girl, put your foot down! Grow a back bone! You shouldn't have to prostrate yourself to a customer just because they're butthurt over an item being out of stock! Not only that, I really didn't like that Todo guy, as he spends all his time being a ridiculously overbearing micromanaging manager who does nothing but berate Akino for every mistake she makes no matter how small, and the few times he does praise her don't amount to much. Is it any wonder she's always so nervous? Hell, one character pops up in the last third of the movie just to tell Akino she sucks at her job and then disappears. I feel like this guy was just shoehorned into the movie for forced third act drama.Another thing I didn't like about the movie is that all of its problems are solved in ways that feel way too clean and neat. Need a perfume that was discontinued years ago? Well, the former head of the department store oh so conveniently managed to find said perfume after making some calls and reaching out to certain people! Need to actually identify this perfume? Let's have this random bear do it! A kid broke a super expensive ice sculpture that can never be replaced? It's fine, the kid made a cake for the sculptor and all is forgiven! Also, this series seems to believe that a concierge should always strive for perfection and be some sort of magical therapist who manages to solve everyone's issues. I admit, I know little about the hospitality industry and how hard it can be, but there really needs to be some kind of line drawn here. There's showing what it's like to work in the hospitality industry, and then there's idealizing it, and I don't think The Concierge does enough of the former, preferring to do too much of the latter, the aforementioned monk seal Karen notwithstanding. There's also the fact that the movie is only an hour long, and I feel like it would have benefited from being just a bit longer so it could flesh out its characters a bit more. Maybe the manga has more details that the anime left out, I don't know.Man, it's a shame I couldn't enjoy this movie more, as there is quite a bit to like about it. It fully commits to its crazy idea and has fun with it, and the animators did a fantastic job of bringing the manga to life in ways only they could. It's a nice, cozy movie to watch if you want to kill an hour, but pretty animation can't hide the fact that its cast of characters are as bland and dull as white rice, nor fix it. It's a light-hearted look at the service industry that doesn't break any new ground...but that's all it is."
Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann,"Gurren Lagann does not deserve the praise it getsGurren Lagann is widely regarded as one of the greatest anime series of all time, and people will frequently cite it as their favorite.When I dislike an anime, I can almost always understand how someone else could like it. For example, I did not enjoy Konosuba, Samurai Champloo, or Paranoia Agent, but I can absolutely understand how others could love them.This isn’t the case for Gurren Lagann.Characters: The characters are almost all extremely one-note with a clear archetype that they rarely stray from. Kamina is the macho gung-ho alpha male. Rossiu is the level-headed straight...man. Nia is the ditzy, cheerful princess. Simon is the stock shounen protagonist who goes head first into every fight and never gives up. The villains are almost all just outright evil, giving viewers little reason to understand where they’re coming from at all. The exception is Viral, who was probably the most interesting character as he at least showed some level of personal depth. The characters were uninteresting at best, and grating and bothersome at worst. They were very unrelatable and difficult to root for. If you like intelligent characters who feel real and show their deepest emotions and weaknesses, then you won’t like these characters. If you prefer characters like Eren Yeager who use “will” and brute force to go through life, then these characters are right up your alley.2/10Plot: The plot was interesting at the beginning. A world where tons of isolated societies are situated underground, oblivious to that which exists above them. I thought the concept was cool, and when the main group made it above ground and began learning about other societies similar to theirs, I thought there was a lot for the show to work with. The “villain of the week” nature of the first cour got stale pretty quickly though, and the show fumbled a great base plot by turning it into a story we’ve seen dozens of times. The time skip really helped to rejuvinate the setting, and for an episode or two it seemed we’d see a major shift to make the plot more compelling, but Gurren Lagann fell back into the same over-the-top action sequences littered throughout the first 16 episodes. The plot was interesting in theory, but the show ultimately did little with it and focused too much on meaningless fights and too little on character relations and existential questions that would surely be dominating the characters’ thoughts.4/10Design/Animation: The animation was good; above average for its time for sure. Art style is subjective, but it wasn’t my cup of tea. A very retro 90’s atmosphere calling back to battle shounens of old. I prefer cleaner, more modern styles with heavy shading. Stuff like Terror in Resonance, Steins;Gate, Chainsaw Man, and so on. But this is my own personal taste, I can’t fault the show for that.6/10Sound: I was not a fan of the soundtrack, but it was objectively not bad by any means. Nothing stellar, but it was acceptable. Voice acting was done well, and the characters’ voices fit the vibe of the show. Really no qualms here.7/10Conclusion: Gurren Lagann wasn’t the worst thing I’ve ever watched. But it absolutely doesn’t deserve the amount of praise it gets from the anime community. It was an average mecha, with exaggerated characters and a mediocre story. Gurren Lagann is One Punch Man before One Punch Man.5/10"
Elfen Lied,"This anime is not suitable for sensitive people, as it contains nudity and extreme gore. Taking this very important factor aside, the story is unexpected, mysterious, entertaining, emotional and overwhelmingly beautiful to the point one might consider this one of the best animes ever made. Initially focusing on Lucy (Niu) and Kouta, it slowly develops more and more onto other points of view; making it a complete masterpiece. The characters are well-rounded, the art style is classic and the animation terribly smooth (especially during the visceral scenes). It's about murder, feelings, family, friendships, relationships, mental health and philosophy. Prepare to gasp and cry a lot:...it starts with blood and ends with tears."
Tsue to Tsurugi no Wistoria,"This anime is a gem that stands out for its stunning visuals and compelling characters.Animation: 10/10Being an “ANIME”, animation is a make or break for a show. Wistoria does not fail to live up to that standard it’s simply incredible! From episode 1 to the end of season 1 the show sets a new benchmark for what anime can look like. The frames are works of art, specifically the detailed backgrounds and architecture. Throughout multiple environments the landscape holds detail. Backgrounds aside the fluidity of the characters movements through battle or lollygagging combined with tendency not to linger on an angles displays the animation team’s...skill. Sure, there were a few awkward moments here and there, like the apple eating in episode 12 or Sion’s familiar’s movement in episode 11, but they were so minor they don't interrupt the experience. The consistency and attention to detail made even the mundane scenes feel like something out of a movie.Story: 7/10The story is a fun ride especially if like me, you’re into underdog narratives. The story plot has heavy influences from Black Clover. Fans of that series will feel right at home here, but Wistoria improves on a few key points. For one, it skips the constant nonsense screaming from Asta that dissuades most from watching and delivers a consistently better animated experience. While the heavy influence stifles the plots ability to break new ground, it’s engaging and well-paced, with Episode 1 standing out as a brilliant introduction to the world. Directed by Yoshihara Tatsuya who notably worked on Black Clover. The first episode is visually brilliant and it expertly sets the stage for the characters, setting, and what’s to come.Characters: 9/10Fundamentally all stories are about relationships and Wistoria does well in that regard. The characters feel authentic. They’re well-developed and experience meaningful growth over the season. The dynamic between the two main professors, whose contrasting bright and dark aesthetics and personalities created a captivating yin-yang balance. The main crew Will, Colette, Sion, and the rest won me over as the episodes went on. By the end, I was fully invested in their journeys and eager to learn more about the antagonists. Additionally, the show’s themes of teamwork and perseverance are definitely there but not too in your face to ruin the show.The show must be commend. Wistoria steers clear of the overused and often unnecessary lustful elements that plague many modern anime. It’s refreshing to see a show focus on story and character without relying on cheap fanservice. Especially when it is not needed.Music 6/10 and Audio Design 8/10Coming fresh off Dandadan, Wistoria’s OST didn’t exactly blow me away. It’s not bad, far from it, but it didn’t leave a lasting impression either. The background music (BGM), on the other hand, was exceptional. It did a phenomenal job of immersing me in the world and enhancing the emotional beats of the story. The audio design overall was top-notch, keeping me locked into the narrative and making every scene feel alive.Favorite EpisodesEpisodes 1, 5, and 11 were definite highlights. Episode 1, in particular, does an outstanding job of pulling you into the world with its stunning visuals and well paced storytelling. I can’t get enough of the classic trope of the bullied underdog saving everyone who bullied them.TLDR/Final ThoughtsWhat makes Wistoria so special is how immersive it feels. Even during quieter moments, it’s like watching a movie. The staff did an incredible job, and I’m excited for the already green lit Season 2. The characters are interesting, the animation is incredible, and the storytelling is enjoyable, Tsue to Tsurugi no Wistoria is a diamond in the rough and a fun show to watch.Overall, it’s a solid 9/10."
Black★Rock Shooter (TV),"This must seen initially like an action type anime that has cool looking weapons, fights, etcetera and, it really is BUT that is absolutely not it's main concept. Black★Rock Shooter is about middle schoolers who are amidst the chaos of getting to know and understand their own selves better while simultaneously trying to build friendships, endure school and care for private lifes/mental health. It also has subtle yuri/homo undertones to it, which is not really worked upon considering the characters' age range. Still, it's there. All the main characters have alternate selves that are there mainly to represent their most intimate selves in a raw...way that can be better understood by the viewers who are following the story. The art-style has a considerably unique style to it, especially the eyes, which are very expressive and convey well the sadness/confusion the characters are feeling and dealing with in many scenes. The fight scenes are also very well animated and nice to watch. I highly recommend it although I understand it's not everyone's cup of tea! Give it a shot with an open heart, if you want to take my humble review in consideration. It's definetely a favorite of mine."
Yubisaki to Renren,"The art is quite pretty. The animation is very fluid, especially while signing.But the anime is so slow, and the MC speaks so slow... Even on double speed, I was bored.(Anime for toddlers where they draw out every single syllable are faster.)I enjoyed the childhood friend from what little I saw. All of the cast is bland and there is not much to their character though.Male lead, although a travelled person that seems to enjoy discovering new things and cultures is reduced to a handsome soft boy. (He touches the MC a lot, and it was annoying to see how the MC reacted to it,...even when he was just a stranger.)Main character is the typical infuriatingly bland shojo protagonist. Pink hair and eyes, because how else would anyone know how uwu soft she is. She is potrayed in kind of infantilising way - as something small, demure, innocent; like you would think of a porcelain toy rather than a person, which sucks. (Koe no Katachi, also about a deaf pinkish hair girl, main character had much more depth, and that was a movie, so a shorter format.)The other characters are not really worth mentioning, typical triangle/pentacle? drama. From what I have read, the anime and manga both just DRAG on. I like slow anime, but this is... snails are faster."
Black★Rock Shooter (OVA),"Black ★ Rock Shooter is (unlike many would initially think) actually about mental health and, has a certain depth to it that is unexpected. The character B★RS herself is actually the representation of the protagonist's (Kuroi Mato) raw inner self, to make the character's feelings better understandable and perhaps even relatable. It represents friendships quite well, as they aren't often only bubbly and nice like oh so many animes portray; there can be awkward moments, words that aren't properly spoken, feelings that get confusing, etc. The art-style is very nice and well put, conveying well the overall atmosphere/vibe of what's going on. I recommend it...but, understand it's really not everyone's cup of tea, which is just fine."
Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kaguya-hime no Koibito,"This movie is very beautiful and interesting: amazing smooth animation, cool villain (pun intended), pretty art-style, well written characters and a great script that goes beyond just magical girl anime. It's about the beauty of love, friendship and life. We also get to know Luna (Usagi's kitten) better and with more depth, following her through her very first love and how she deals with it emotionally. I recommend this movie because it is suitable for people of all ages, otakus or not! Bonus points for Luna's love interest being an absolute sweetheart: curious and kind. If you take your time to watch it, enjoy!"
Kidou Senshi Gundam: Fukushuu no Requiem,"6.25/10 - IGLOO Part 3This is essentially Netflix's attempt at Gundam IGLOO, however CGI animation has finally come far enough where this kinda stuff is actually palatable. I enjoyed this enough, and as a UC Fan Girl I will always take more content especially about the OYW.You could also look at this show as a 'Band of Brothers' but make it Gundam. This show also embodies the whole Real Robots not Super robot thing from back in the 70's, as each mobile suite really feels like a machine. You also really understand the scale of the suits that happens seldomly in all the series...regardless of sub franchise, outside of rare moments like in War in the Pocket (0080).This show has not the best characters, nor development for them. the pacing is good enough, and the story feels complete. Feels weird to say that this is better then most Gundam content out there, by only a little. If this show does well enough I imagine there will be more.Honestly this show felt like anyone could appreciate it, which is some huge selling points. I wouldn't be surprised if this is many first Gundam, its short, sweet, not to political and easily digestible. I think this does get better if you watch it after at least the original series (0079), but by no means is that a requirement to watch this."
Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon R: The Movie,"Sailor Moon in general is and always has been about the power of love and friendship, which is adorable. In this movie, there is a certain undertone of homo attraction from Fiore towards Mamoru: Usagi's boyfriend. As the story goes, it's understood why everything is happening just the way that it is, although you might get a little confused at the very beginning. The animation is smooth, the art-style is beautiful, the characters are mostly very distinct from each other and the Sailor team completes each other's strengths an weaknesses well. I recommend this and think you'd definetely enjoy it if you're into shoujo."
Amnesia,"Amnesia is a rather popular one or, at least it was back in the day (which surprises me a lot). It's one of those titles almost everyone has heard about but, that really doesn't make it good. Based off of an otome game, the art-style is very pretty but the protagonist has weak personality traits to seem more relatable to it's viewers who seek self-insertion. That makes it absolutely terrible to watch because the heroine ignores red-flags throughout the ENTIRE thing! She doesn't even have a name of her own, for God's sake... overall, only put your time on it if you're bored."
Monogatari Series: Off & Monster Season,"Animation: Not much to say. Shaft is not a flashy studio like Ufotable or Mappa. But where they lack in eye candy they more than make up for in art direction. Every frame serves a purpose. Every frame has personality. And in this entry, those qualities are as present as ever.Nadeko DrawStory: Definitely one of the stronger stories so far. A very moving culmination of a decade’s worth of character development for a very complex, well-written character. As with past stories, Nisio Isin’s usage of his aberrations to give shape to the inner complexities of his characters is fascinating, and with this story, very well...executed. This story seems like a great improvement on the author’s unique storytelling method, and Shaft presented it very well.Music: Some pretty clever usage of Renai Circulation’s main melody. Definitely an old fashioned approach to scoring, but executed perfectly. A tasteful use is heard in the main opening, but also the utilization in character themes was done very well. Also very appropriate to the theme of the story. A story where the main character is confronting their storied past is perfect for this form of musical expression.As for the ending. YOASOBI loves their 4-on-the-floor dance grooves, but I would be lying if I said this song wasn’t catchy as hell. And the visuals were also quite simple, but stunning in their own right. Quite a testament to their confidence and commitment to making quality music.Overall, one of the best if not the best stories of the entire franchise so far. Quite simple in some ways, such as the music, but I don’t view that negatively at all. In my opinion, the later installments to the monogatari series, such as Hana, Tsuki, and all of Owari, were straying from the simplicity that really made me enjoy the earlier installments like Bake. So seeing Nadekomonogatari really makes me feel refreshed. The vision is still alive. 9.6/10Shinobu MustardStory: To start with, let me just say the short story that prefaced this arc was very good. I think it set up Suicide-Master's character well and gave good insight into Shinobu's origin. However, the main arc leaves much to be desired. The pacing of this arc was pretty bad. It took me a lot of willpower to remain interested. Its cool that Araragi came back, and there was definitely some great humor thrown in here and there, but overall, the story was boring, didn't have much at stake, and mostly served to reunited Shinobu and Suicide Master. It seemed unnatural and awkward to me and I think that it was executed poorly.Music: A good third of the arc actually lacked any sort of opening theme or overarching motif throughout the story, and when it did finally show up, it was just a recycled version of past Shinobu arc OPs that was executed uncreatively and didn't have much going for it in terms of visuals. Uninspired and uncreative. Very dissapointing.Overall, boring. Not much to say. I really feel like they flubbed the momentum they built with the first arc. Suicide-Master ended up being quite boring and didn't add much to the story. The twist at the end was unexpected for sure, but it was weird and random."
Dandadan,"I had no understanding nor expectations of Dandadan coming into it; almost passed over it. I'm glad I didn't.In a year of almost constantly terrible animation (with some exceptions of course) Dandadan has been amazing. The quality and love this show has been shown by the studio is on par with Akira. In fact it kind of shares more with FLCL. The themes are mostly about teen angst, sexuality (thank goodness it's not hamfisted though), and the wonderment of youth at the possibilities of life (as seen through the lens of the paranormal) are all parts of growing up.Sound has been on point as well,...and I don't just mean the bangin OP and ED either. The sound mixing has been very well done, as opposed to some other anime or even western media in general where everything is a whisper but random sound effects shatter your eardrums and windows and your cat hides forever in a closet.The cast of characters is a motley crew of a somewhat regular girl that ostensibly finds okarun awkward and distasteful, but they quickly become friends after arguing whether or not ghosts or aliens exist. Fear not, kiddos: we get ghosts, aliens, curses, the dang ol loch Ness monster, pistol shrimp (?), and a seemingly 30 year old grandmother with a bat.The sexual themes can be a little obvious at times, but are handled both tastefully and comically. Everyone's after the banana...To digress, this has been a wild ride and I'm only 3/4 of the way done. A lot of this year has been a let down, particularly in the realm of animation but this show has it in spades. Comedy shows and writing in general can be extremely hard to do, and most settle with basic ""misunderstanding"" or other tropes, but Dandadan has chosen a unique way of approaching not only that but also the angst of the teenage experience.10/10, in every category. Right now for me this is AOTY."
Little Busters!,"Just like with Clannad and Clannad: After Story, Little Busters is just the formality you have to go through in order to get to Little Busters Refrain. Refrain is the really the interesting part. However, Little Busters on its own is not too bad anyways. Especially near the end it gets much better than the start and middle. In general, it's passable.The symmetry between ""Clannad + After Story"" and ""Little Busters + Refrain"" is not just in the fact that the sequel is more interesting. It's also that Little Busters is a pretty normal highschool melodrama while Refrain takes a more serious tone. Little Busters...follows a group of 5 friends as they try to make a baseball team before the eldest one, Kyousuke, graduates. The formula is basically that Riki tries to recruit people, which eventually results in him helping to resolve their problems or tragedies. Consequently, there's a story arc for each girl Riki helps out until they have enough for a team.The background story/premise is pretty interesting. I will not rehash it because it is in the synopsis, but I can relate to how Riki is feeling. He feels indebted to his friends who got him out of his shell and wishes he could remain with them for longer. However, he knows that it might all end when Kyousuke graduates, followed 1 year later by everyone else graduating. Forming the baseball team is a way he can enjoy his situation to the max before it all goes away.The story arcs have this general structure where Riki meets character --> eventually discovers problem --> tries best to solve problem --> life lesson monologue at the character. In all honesty, it wasn't too bad the first few times. However, I found myself slowly running out of stamina due to this formula. It doesn't help that some arcs like Kudryavka were too out there to be believable. I won't get into spoilers, but that arc left the scope of a high school melodrama and in a bad way. Kudryavka in general was the least interesting addition to the cast, but I'll let that slide for now.Out of the entire cast of characters, only a few characters have personalities that go beyond surface level. This is not to say that they are all bad. Most of their personalities do lead to a good show. However, it's just that their character traits are simple and they just operate based on their obvious traits. Here's a brief assessment of each one:- Kyousuke: By far the most complex, interesting and enjoyable. Acts as sort of a guiding figure for Riki and the friend group in general.- Riki: Simple character. Just a goody two shoes who wants to help everyone. His interactions with Kyousuke are the most interesting.- Rin: Shy girl archetype.- Masato: Simple comedic relief. Good natured guy who is physically really strong but also acts really stupid. He is interesting in Refrain.- Kengo: Interesting in Refrain, but in Little Busters he is just the upright character archetype.- Komari : Bubbly girl archetype.- Mio (usually referred to as Nishizono): Rei from Evangelion archetype.- Yuiko (Kurugaya): The archetype of the girl that is refined but teases a lot.- Haruka (Saigusa): Energetic girl archetype, but at least her backstory was enjoyable- Kudryavka: Cutesy girl archetype.As for the rest, the music is good. The environment is normal. The animation is passable but not great."
Hananoi-kun to Koi no Yamai,"This is a super sweet slice of lice shoujo. I don't understand why the general score is so low, it does not deserve it at all.The story (and the male mc) may appear as somehow toxic in the beginning but it is not. Both main characters have some issues in the way they are because of their background and life experiences. Together, each episode, they learn new things, grow as individuals and teach each other new things in life that may seem normal for everyone but not for them.I found it cute and sweet and will read the manga to keep up with their story....I totally recommend to watch it if you love slice of life shoujo."
One Piece: Gyojin Tou-hen,"Toei Animation is known for ruining the One Piece anime with its mediocre, at best, pacing. The Fishman Island arc, in particular, heavily suffered from this pacing issue, adapting ~50 chapters into ~50 episodes.However, this second adaptation of the renowned Fishman Island arc seeks to give new viewers a better chance to enjoy it.First, the pacing issue that plagued the original anime adaptation of the Fishman Island arc is seemingly gone from this adaptation. Each episode adapts ~2-3 chapters, which heavily contrasts the original anime, which adapted either one chapter or ~75% of a chapter per episode during the Fishman Island arc. This...change in pacing makes this adaptation much easier to consume than the previous one.The animation style is akin to the Wano arc in the One Piece anime (eps 892-1088), which gives this anime a colourful animation style, which some may or may not enjoy. I dig it, but it's understandable why some may not.However, there are a few negative things about this adaptation and the arc itself. Sanji's nosebleeds upon viewing Nami and Nico Robin are quite annoying, albeit a bit less than the original anime adaptation. However, it might be worse in the coming episodes.Although the animation is much better than the original adaptation, it sometimes feels stiff and lacking. There are moments within this adaptation when the animation is a bit barebones. It reminds me of ""KonoSuba Season 3"".In the end, I'd recommend watching this after watching episode 516 of the original One Piece anime adaptation and resuming at episode 574 of the OG anime upon finishing this adaptation, making the viewing experience objectively better.I'd rate this adaptation an 8/10 after considering its ups and downs."
Animation Kikou: Marco Polo no Bouken,"A journey through Madhouse episode #6: the first stumble of the road.I can't say much about Marco Polo no Bouken simply because most of its episodes are Lost Media today. The episodes are so damaged that not even NHK has been able to do restoration work on them. An Italian television station also had the rights to broadcast them but today not much more than a dozen episodes are preserved. There should be VHS tapes of this anime that were sold at the time, but today no one has been found who preserves these tapes, making the preservation work difficult.I think the concept of the...anime was a bit ambitious for the time, since it made a combination of animation with footage of the real locations through which Marco Polo passed on his travels. The quality of the episodes that have been saved is minimal, sometimes you can't even see what is happening on screen.I just wanted to leave this review as proof of this trip, that the effort was made to see everything available about this work and to attest that I have not missed any stop on this trip."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"Here's the thing: I entered Jujutsu Kaisen Season 1 hoping for something exciting—something that would really stand out in the sea of shonen anime. Instead, what I got was a show that is simply.fine. Not bad, but certainly not great. If anything, it's the textbook definition of average.The story starts with Yuji Itadori, your average sweetheart of a protagonist, whose life takes a sharp turn right after his grandfather's passing. His grandpa was speaking about helping others to the very end, giving Yuji an overly simple moral compass. He managed to swallow a cursed object long story and became the host for Sukuna, the ridiculously...powerful demon. Cue the standard shonen setup: Yuji is spared from execution because someone has a ""genius plan"" to have him consume all of Sukuna’s cursed fingers, only to kill him later and eradicate Sukuna completely. It’s a decent premise, sure, but it feels like something we’ve seen a dozen times before in other series.The middle portion of the show is essentially a loop: Yuji and his team come across curses, fight them, and continue. The fights? They're fine. Some choreography is straight-up insane, and MAPPA did a pretty good job on the animation. But let's be honest—most of the time, the animation and the visuals are merely above average. It's not jaw-dropping nor groundbreaking, despite what the hype might make you believe.Now, the characters… oh boy. Yuji, Nobara, and Megumi are fine, but that's the problem—they're just fine. Nobara has her moments, sure, but none of them have the kind of depth or originality that makes you think about them long after the episode ends. Even Gojo, who's supposed to be the scene-stealer, feels like a trope: the overpowered, carefree mentor we've seen a million times before.Let's talk about the villains in Jujutsu Kaisen Season 1 because, honestly, they're just… there. They're supposed to be these creepy, mysterious curses with a ""high boss"" pulling the strings behind the scenes, but it all comes across as so childish. Like, sure, they try to give them this air of superiority, acting like they're above humans and all, but at the end of the day, they're just monsters pretending to be deep.And then, of course, there's the huge attack during the school tournament. Seriously? Of all times, that's when the bad guys decide to come? It's just so cliché, and it has little impact in the first place. They come, they get their butt kicked, and that's it. No depth, no dimension, no feeling of risk that lingers. They are mid-tier villains at best, trying to be more than they are and failing miserably.Ultimately, Jujutsu Kaisen is watchable. It's fun enough and fight scenes that will keep you invested; there is nothing, however, that screams ""special."" It is a good distraction, but if you're seeking a shonen that will break the mold, it isn't it. For me, it is 5/10 –average, mid, forgettable. If you saw one shonen, you basically see this one too."
Blue Lock vs. U-20 Japan,"Let me talk about BlueLock, because wow, I have some feelings. Season 1? It was interesting. I'll give it that. It took a sports anime cliché, chewed it up, and spit out something fresh. Forget unity and teamwork—this was about egoism. Everyone wanted to be the star, and honestly, it was a unique, refreshing take. The first episode hit hard: crisp visuals, fiery characters, and enough intensity to make you think, ""Yeah, this might be one of the best sports anime ever.""And then… episode 2 happened. The animation stumbled, not faceplanting, but enough to make you notice. It wasn't bad—it was ""above average,"" let's say....As episodes went by, the dialogue went cringe sometimes, but somehow it felt part of the charm. It was a shonen battle anime masquerading as football, and I gave it respect for that. It had its peaks, troughs, and by the end of the 24 episodes, I thought to myself, ""You know what? Worth it.""Then Season 2. Oh my god, it was an absolute trainwreck. Episode 1 left us with a false sense of security. The characters stood around, waiting for their next mission, and because not much action was required, no one was paying attention to the storm brewing in the horizon. The art style looked good, the drawings were solid, and you were thinking, ""Okay, maybe this season will deliver."" But in retrospect, it was the calm before the disaster. No one realized how much worse it was going to get.And then came Episode 2. Friends, I've seen motion in 1940s Godzilla films that's smoother than this. BlueLock Season 2 has mastered the ancient art of sliding PNGs across the screen. Forget running, kicking, or even blinking—there's no movement here. They throw in motion lines to fool you into thinking something is happening, but it's not. One time, they just flat-out used a PowerPoint transition for a scene change. I wish I were kidding. I have seen kindergarten kids do better animations with macaroni art.By Episode 4, I was done. I couldn't take it anymore. I had read the manga for this arc—the U-20 match! It is one of the best arcs for BlueLock. The hype, the stakes, the story—are all there. However, this adaptation? The manga is insulted to even be compared with something such as this. The mouth isn't moving because ""they are always running."" Guess what? They don't even have animated running. They only move characters around like doomed cutouts from a bootleg sticker book.BlueLock Season 2 is not taking shortcuts. It's cutting through the whole damn fabric of animation. There's nothing good about it. NOTHING. Watching this season felt like they weren't animating football—they were animating my suffering. I'm angry, I'm disappointed, and frankly, I'm sad for the manga. If you love BlueLock, save yourself the agony. Stick to the manga. Don't let Season 2 ruin your life."
Chainsaw Man,"Chainsaw Man isn't just some run-of-the-mill anime series; instead, it depicts something raw, unflinching with regard to human nature, particularly at a stage where one thinks little more than evil and good could prevail. End. Instead, it delves into how circumstances shape us, how even the kindest person can break under pressure, and how even the most flawed individual can show moments of grace. It’s about the line between good and bad being blurred, about how fragile and malleable humans really are.Denji, the protagonist, is the most realistic and human character I’ve ever seen in anime. At 16, he is not chasing some grand, lofty...dream or a world-changing ideal. Having grown up in extreme poverty, all he wants is a normal life — a roof over his head, good food, maybe a girlfriend. His desires are simple and raw, which makes him deeply relatable. Denji doesn't even know what it means to have ""big dreams"" because his idea of happiness is built on the simple things he's never had. That is what separates him from your typical shonen hero: he's imperfect, down-to-earth, and very human.The supporting cast mirrors this same realism. They aren't perfect, noble heroes; they're deeply flawed, selfish, and vulnerable in ways that make them feel real. Even the ambitious people aren't made glamorous; the movie has managed to weave up their complexities and show through this that even the greatest ambitions made someone alienated and isolated. Such character depth comes from their contradictions—the initial appearance may seem shallow; you begin to watch a long time to realize their full, profound layer.While there is nothing too special with its characters, art and creativity really stand out in Chainsaw Man. It has brutal but meaningful fights, really distinct character designs, and just so much detail to the point that it's fresh, and not just a borrower from other series-it actually creates something that influences, rather than imitates.What makes Chainsaw Man truly special is the way it combines gritty realism with philosophical depth. It does not only entertain; it makes you think about human nature, survival, and morality. This is a masterpiece that sets the new standard for anime, and I wholeheartedly recommend it."
Tasogare Out Focus,"I adore the manga this anime is based on and the only reason I'm not rating this higher is because I'd rather recommend the manga. It's basically a shot by shot direct adaptation of the manga apart from one storyline. This style of adapting can by its nature never enhance the source material because it doesn't play to the strength of its medium. It's also hesitant to fully the sex scenes and rather sticks to a couple shots with dialogue, which is fair for any non-hentai anime, but it does kind of suck. The animation in general isn't the best, the movement is kind of...stilted and especially the kiss scenes look kind of off. The dub voice acting, however, is incredible, which does help elevate the show."
Oooku,"No spoilers review-If you’re looking for something even remotely cute, heartwarming, or happy romance, this is not for you. This is a fair warning as to what kind of story it is so you don’t have different expectations going in. It’s definitely not wholesome or uplifting. This is on the morose and depressing side. Personally, I wouldn’t even categorize it as a romance even though it technically is. I wouldn’t say it’s a court drama about consorts either (examples of what it is not like in terms of court drama: Apothecary Diaries, No Doubt in Us, Psychic Princess).It has several dark themes. Content warnings for...sexual violence (throughout the show), violence (many overt murders), and suicide. Sexual violence is done by both genders and often in same gender situations.It left me feeling empty. I wasn’t expecting a sugary show, but definitely not this either. Immediately after I had to watch a cute romance with a happy ending to cleanse my palate (Tonikawa)."
Haibane Renmei,"i typed top 10 philosophical anime, this name came up so i thought let's give it a shoti'm not sure this is the case but it seems like this anime is inspired by Martin Heideggerthere were themes of ""thrownness or falling in the world"", ""anxiety from existing"", ""care"", ""guilt"",...it can't be a coincidence, the Haibane is a symbol of Daseinthe anime captures the theme okay but unfortunately the story isn't that great because the dialogues are trash, it the same old unnatural conversations you hear when empty characters talk, ""i believe in reki"", ""reki is reki, isn't it reki?!!""again, you can get tricked by thinking...this anime is great because it has philosophical topics but it is a fucking ANIMEthe priority is story-telling, it's character development, which we don't really have in this animethe guilt rakka feels isn't really felt by us about existing and being useless, rakka is a horrible character, an actual NPC, nothing interesting about her, the only character worth mentioning is Reki, but even she didn't do a great job, it was just okaythis anime reminded me of ""Shinsekai yori"", in that anime characters got ""developed"" based on survival, you knew them by how they ""reacted"", but ultimately they were empty and all of them were the same personality, they are what writers call ""character type"", you don't see a human, you see a ""type"", like ""angry dude"" or ""yandere"",...this anime suffers the same thing, the characters are just types, they don't have actual human conversation or reactionit's funny because before this anime i read Tolstoy's opinion on good art and he mentions that using the world or history of a country that your characters are in, is a form of cheatingfor example, if i write a book where the MC lives in Ottoman Empire and instead of focusing on my story, i start by describing how Ottoman culture was back then, i'm cheating, i'm using history to keep you entertained, and this will keep you entertained but not because of my story but because of Ottoman history, it's cheatingthe same thing happens more or less in this storythere is this weird wall and how you shouldn't touch it, how you shouldn't talk to those plague mask guys (which the anime never explained why)these are fascinating world buildings but how do they help with character development, or even the plot?well, they don'tdid the walls have to exist for the story to function? these are random facts that are thrown at usoverall i was watching this bored all the way till the end but it wasn't bad enough for me to drop iti wanted to give it a 5 but because of trying to be philosophical, i give a 6"
Isekai Suicide Squad,Suicide Squad is pretty alright for the most of the anime but it a little PG and that doesn't make sense considering who they areand it's not like anime never did diabolical stuff but that's a minor problem for me .All of the characters are mostly okay with the exception of original characters that the anime introduced .I do not like any of those characters and it's hard to care when they don't do anything until the very final moments of the show .I'm familiar with all the characters from DC that are in this anime as most DC fans would be .Harley Quinn...is cute and fun but you don't feel that she's a psycho at allDeadshot is just there and doesn't really do a whole lot other than bicker with characters and shoot enemiesKing Shark was nice and pretty much the mascotPeacemaker is perhaps the one that's closest to normal Peacemaker which is sick and badassClayface tho is the most different and easily the best and most entertaining aspect of this animeClayface is a brilliant character wasted in this mediocre show .Suicide Squad Isekai embraces all the generic isekai tropes and it's really funsome other characters like Enchantress and Rick Flag are pretty funIt's interesting to see well established and famous DC characters just exist in an animeand specifically an anime that embraces all of the common tropes but outside of that ....not much else to offer .This isn't for DC fans because all of the characters are very little like their definitive versions .This ain't for anime fans because it's just not good enough of an anime to warrant a watch .Suicide Squad is for the people who like both such as me .
Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu,"PLEASE READ THIS TO THE END!!!For starters, what the hell was this????I mean, I know it's a parody show but... having tons of unjustified fan service, cringy OVERRATED internal MC dialogues, and the most boring and random cast you could ever think of... is absolute missed potential here ladies and gentlemen.But hold up! I said it has tons of crap but is still ""missed potential""??? The hell am I talking about????(Note : I will be talking about both seasons here and not just the first. I'll explain why at the end)Well, the thing is, this show starts as an actually geniune mystery/supernatural show. The first...6 episodes titled, you guessed it, ""The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya"", sets the stage for something grand, something unique. I would have been OKAY and FORGIVING even it slapped its meta humour on top of the supernatural stuff, but instead, what this show ended up doing is ""supernatural stuff slapped on top of cringy slice of life meta humour'After finishing the first 6 episodes you might think that the sky is the limit, right? right???Wrooooooooong.After those episodes, we get nothing but a lame baseball match, an undercooked small island ark, an infamously controversial set of 8 identical episodes, followed by the worst arc of them all, AND FINALLY one boring slow episode that does LITERALLY NOTHING.Everything you shouldn't be doing in a supernatural parody show was done here.HOWEVER, I think it deserves a watch for two BIG REASONS. The first being that it is an infamous show that you need to know of. While the second is that... the final episode was not the end. After the release of seaon two, we got something huge. A movie titled ""The Disappearance Of Haruhi Suzumiya"" which is, hands down, one of the best cinematic experiences ever. A movie that you cannot miss.To actually FEEL the movie, you NEED to watch the show.Now how come a bad mid show be so essential? Well, just as I told you, the movie slaps hard that it makes you like the characters and the world that you hated initially.Now... there is one crutial detail about the airing of this show.This show was released in NO ORDER. Can you believe that?Even if you go to wikipedia, you will only find multiple different watch orders which I think are... let's just say the creators themselves had no idea what they were doing.However, I took it upon myself to come up with the most tolerable watch order that would allow the consumers to make sense of this show.There you go :-I- Season 101 - The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya Part One02 - The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya Part Two03 - The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya Part Three04 - The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya Part Four05 - The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya Part Five06 - The Boredom Of Haruhi Suzumiya07 - Remote Island Syndrome Part One08 - Remote Island Syndrome Part Two09 - Mystérique Sign10 - The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya Part Six-II- Season 201 - Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody02 - The Sight Of Haruhi Suzumiya Part One03 - The Sight Of Haruhi Suzumiya Part Two04 - The Sight Of Haruhi Suzumiya Part Three05 - The Sight Of Haruhi Suzumiya Part Four06 - The Sight Of Haruhi Suzumiya Part Five07 - Live Alive08 - Someday in The Rain09 - The Day Of Sagittarius10 - Endless Eight I11 - Endless Eight II12 - Endless Eight VIII-III- The Disappearance Of Haruhi SuzumiyaI split them in the form of seasons because it's more fitting. What I mean is that once you reach the tenth episode in this order, you can consider that a either a turning point that you should be prepared for, OR a stopping point if you decide to drop the show. Maybe you'll get it once you watch it.As for the ""Endless Eight"" episodes there were EIGHT OF THEM but I believe you only need those three that I listed here. You can find more info about endless eight in youtube because, wo ho ho I DO NOT INTEND ON BRINGING THIS TOPIC IN HERE.And finally, if you wish, you can just skip ""The Sight Of Haruhu"" episodes. I only listed them here because they are one of the infamous things about this show.Anyways, I hope this helps."
Hoshifuru Oukoku no Nina,"Love triangle stories! Some hate them and should stay away from this one.Even if you like or just don't mind them, you're not ready for a love triangle this messy.From rags to riches overnight, Nina's heart wishes for just one person she can be special to. Then, not one, but two princes fall in love with her. Princes from enemy countries. At constant risk of war. Surely, nothing could go wrong.The princes start off as brutes, one of them is sharply more cruel than the other, but maybe the female lead's kindness can fix them both? She is adorable, feisty, with a positive...attitude, though also naive and immature.Oh, there are cute animals to bring more fun to the show.Animation is okay. Music is good. The pacing is very quick. With only 12 episodes to cram so much of the source material it has to be. Adapted from a medieval fantasy josei manga with supernatural elements, political intrigue and very entangled romance, this should be entertaining if you like soap operas!"
Yumemiru Danshi wa Genjitsushugisha,"I'd rather watch this than some other overrated complicated anime I know.In fact, I did watch this from start to finish and it's pretty good, honestly.The only thing hindering this from earning my trademark rating of ""9 for that was FIRE"" is the unfortunate way this anime is paced.It keeps starting plotlines and dropping them randomly for the sake of new ones which it also drops once it gets bored of them.That's fricking sad because most of the plotlines are really fun and they had potential.Oh well, it's good I guess.It's a fun watch for any rom com weeb out there. At least if you...accepted its pacing and didn't hold it against it.The characters are the highlight that makes this fun despite its pacing. Let alone the stupid and hillarious events throughout its runtime which gives it a life of its own. This is why it clicked with me and entered the part of my brain where I can never forget it."
2.5-jigen no Ririsa,"This shows is what happens when you take the source material, and just completely disregard It. 2.5-jigen no Ririsa had so much potential to be like my dress-up darling in the ways that they used nudity and expression to show in the manga how fun and how free cosplaying can be. But instead, they censor the hell out of the anime, and add extra scenes that just didn't need to be there +  just take out the literal fun and expression in what made the manga so good in the first place!!! Very disappointed to see one of my favorite manga get such an...unfaithful adaptation."
Umibe no Étranger,"Stranger by the Shore's anime adaptation is too short and incoherent. It simply doesn't work as a film, requiring previous knowledge of the material to be actually enjoyed and, to a certain extent, understood. To a viewer unfamiliar with the manga, it becomes a guessing game and ultimately fails to bear any emotional impact, as the plot moves along too quickly to let the dust settle and to allow feelings of empathy with any of the characters to bloom.The animation is beautiful, though, and there are some truly touching moments. It's just unfortunate that everything's so condensed and fast-moving. This could easily have been turned...into a terrific miniseries. As it stands, it leaves much to be desired.Why 7, then? Well, even if the characters and their relationships are underdeveloped and/or left unexplained, there are just enough glimpses of near excellence to merit a good rating (and to give a taste of what the manga may be like). Moreover, there are cute cats and same-gender relationships, which, in this reviewer's mind, is always a plus.In short, although this film will be best appreciated by those who have read the manga, those who haven't can still enjoy watching it. It is, all things considered, a solid BL and a fine slice of life, however concise it may be."
Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica Movie 3: Hangyaku no Monogatari,"This movie is THE way to make an anime movie. Fight me.Stunning visuals I can never forget.Awesome, yet admitilly a little lacking, storyline full of mystery and drama.Peak characterisation of the charaters we know and love (you won't notice it because the writers kinda took the route of ""a focus character"" and prefered to throw most of the attention on her, but I'd argue she always has been the best character anyways so that's a big W for us).Everything is polished, makes sense, full of some crazy action scenes, and leads to a satisfying resolution that sets the stage for the next upcoming movie WHICH...IS TOTALLY COMING OUT DON'T WORRY.Rebellion is THE Madoka Magica Experience you wouldn't want to miss."
Seirei Gensouki 2,"What happened to this season?The story is far from unique—it’s slow, predictable, and lacks the spark of creativity. While some might enjoy the slice-of-life approach, this season doesn’t do it justice. The dialogues are unnecessarily long, the humor leans too political to be universally funny, and any sense of adventure is completely absent.The art style is a highlight—it’s visually appealing and well-crafted—but it feels wasted on such a sluggish and uninspired storyline. As for the characters, they’re one-dimensional at best. There’s little depth or growth; they don’t feel like real people, and their reactions to situations often come across as forced or unrealistic.Ultimately, I can't...recommend this season to fans of adventure or comedy. Those who enjoy slow-paced slice-of-life stories might find something here, but for me, it was a letdown. I was able to condense each episode into 10-12 minutes without feeling like I missed anything important—a testament to how much filler and unnecessary content this season includes."
Evangelion Movie 1: Jo,"There is not much to say about this movie, if you enjoy the original series first 6 episodes and want to rewatch then now in a higher definition feel free to enjoy this well put together movie, if you havent watched the original series you may lose some tricks of storytelling that the movie in a limited screentime is not able to show in its full glory, this movie is a starting point of a new history reminding ourselves of what we already knew and enjoyed in the original, so as its own entity it does the job well enough where you feel that its...existence is justifiable but not anything groundbreaking or that will blow your mind, just fine."
FLCL: Shoegaze,"I am just... bewilderedWhat the hell did I even watchThis is a narrative sequel to FLCL Alternative (doesn't mention anything from Grunge so lmao... I don't really know what happened to Progressive either, other than Prog's ED, there seems to be no correlation between Progressive and any of the other FLCL sequels), you DO need to watch Alternative to understand what's happening, which is unfortunateHaruko also isn't here for this run which... I'm actually fine with? In a vacuum, I don't think FLCL NEEDS Haruko to be FLCL and I thought Harumi was a fine enough replacement.Speaking of which, let's talk about the two protagonists!...I actually liked Masaki and Harumi, I'd argue other than maybe Hidomi from Progressive (which, tbh, is partly because she's got a cute design), they're my favorite protagonists from the sequels. Masaki's just kind of your average lone wolf but he has a fun dynamic with Harumi, I thought they were cute.One of the advantages of not having Haruko around is you can just... have a normal relationship going on. This is the closest to a true romantic relationship we get in all of FLCL and I would've liked to see more. Idk, in some parallel universe, it would have been cool to see these two go on, like, a Heathers-esque run or something.Quite literally the only other character worth mentioning is [ALTERNATIVE SPOILERS]. While obviously they just HAD to pull from FLCL OG to poke the nostalgia spot, we haven't seen anyone from any of the FLCL sequels appear in the other sequels so they kinda feel like they live in their own universe. I kinda assumed Grunge was a follow-up to Alternative because it had the same ""oh, Earth sucks, let's go to Mars"" deal but this one actually brings someone back from Alternative to have a large role.It was a nice touch and I think using her to contrast with the teenage terrorist duo as well as someone actually growing to adulthood in FLCLand would have been interesting....I haven't mentioned something very important though....this series is only three episodes long.This doesn't give us much time to explore the teenage MCs OR [SPOILERS] and on top of that, they're trying to do WAY too much for the three episodes they are allotted.There's parallel dimensions and ""imaginary time"" and Atomsk is a whale now and what the fuck is this?This feels completely different from FLCL. We're at the point where teenage terrorists are trying to blow up a giant tower for ~reasons~ and there are weird ghosts only one of the two can see and there are alternative dimensions and he somehow reached into ""imaginary time"" to reveal more of the tower and like what does this have to do with FLCL?For what it's worth, and I'll give it mad props for this, it doesn't really take much from FLCL OG. No LAST DINOSAUR (I can't say for sure if it played any OG FLCL tunes or not but I didn't notice any if it did), no characters from the original FLCL, no ""Never Knows Best"", while there's still, like, Medical Mechanica, this is more or less its own story (or, rather, a sequel to Alternative that tries to stand out from FLCL OG's shadow)But, on the other foot, the LAST (as of writing) FLCL season was not the time to do this.This is what Alternative should've been (timing-wise). Let Progressive be the victory lap and Alternative be what pushes FLCL forward. But when Alternative and Grunge (more or less) are also following similar beats to FLCL OG, Shoegaze just sticks out like a sore thumb.It also completely eschews any pretensions of having mecha battles or any battles at all for that matter which makes me wonder, combined with Grunge's shitty 3D and both Grunge and Shoegaze only being three episodes each, if they just didn't have the budget?Why did they bother making these then?No, seriously, who was asking for a second helping of FLCL sequels?The ending is just kind of a wet fart, I don't even know what to say.Like, what am I supposed to do with this?It's just kind of a thud, not just for FLCL as a series, not just for the Alterna-verse, but even just for Shoegaze as an isolated entry.It feels like I wasted my (admittedly small amount of, given the short run) time.It's just... sure, whatever. I'd talk about it more but I don't want to shift this into spoiler territory.And that's how FLCL as a franchise ends.I hadn't heard much about Shoegaze going into this and... um... yep. That'd sure explain it.I actually enjoyed a decent portion of this but then it just kinda goes off the rails and swerves straight into a ditch/telephone pole combo and I don't know what you want me to do with this, Adult Swim.In a way, I'd prefer this ended with Grunge because at least Grunge was kind of coherent? Sure, it sucked ASS (also, I feel this is as good a time as any to mention there are 0 rockmen in Shoegaze so... um... yeah...) but it had an ending that would make sense. Sure, it's also kind of a ""lol""-tier ending but tbh, that's kind of been par for the course with these sequels.If Alternative and Grunge were like a cat giving me a dead mouse and expecting me to be happy, this is like a cat bringing me a Nebulous Object of Unknown Origin.I do not know what you want from me, Adult SwimIt's not really something whose ending you can ignore either because if there was a way to cut it off at a good time, I would.It's not without its charm, I did enjoy the main duo and it actually starts out pretty strong/intriguing but by the end, it's just... like... what are we doing here.If you do want to dive into the FLCL sequels, IMO, you're better off only watching Progressive and pretending Alternative/Grunge/Shoegaze don't exist.I'd say Alternative is slightly better than Shoegaze so it'd be OG > Progressive > Alternative > Shoegaze > Grunge but trust me, past Progressive, it's just... like... come on, man"
Ojisan to Marshmallow,"This is a wholesome anime that is a great binge watch if you're in the mood.It's about an overweight man named Hige and his coworker Wakabayashi who both have a deep love for marshmallows. Yes, it is literally the one thing they have in common. The show follows them as they explore their love for the treat in different ways. The viewer also quickly discovers that there may be some feelings felt by Wakabayashi for Hige as well. I particularly liked this because it is incredibly rare to find an anime with an overweight character who is viewed as desirable and not as ugly...or a buffoon. There are definitely some sweet moments in the show that will make the viewer smile or go 'awww'. It also has quite a few funny moments as it is a comedy anime, after all. I liked Wakabayashi's brother and found him very amusing at times. Their relationship as bro and sis was also pretty wholesome and sweet. There is a typical romantic rivalry subplot as well with a character you'll love to hate. Overall, despite the episodes being only 3.5 minutes long, it doesn't really feel like they're that short. The episode length is used well to tell a micro story. Sadly, the one thing I really disliked was how the series ended. It left things unresolved and was very frustrating.Anyway, I hope I convinced some people to check out this series. Don't let the rating on MAL fool you because it is worth watching despite the low rating."
Golden Kamuy 3rd Season,"Just stupid good, I love the story, the depth of the characters' motivations, and how they are all tangled up with each other. its funny, tense and all around charming!Also coming from someone who lives in Canada and has been exposed to a lot of modern Indigenous media so much of it is honestly guilt-based and feels like a broken record. while the issues they experience are valid, it seems like this perspective is the only one we get force-fed to watch and I've been so burned out of it for at least 8 years now.fortunately, Golden Kamuy does the exact opposite in by...indulging us in a rich culture without any of the guilt-based baggage to come along with it. its always so interesting to learn the different traditions of these tribes and the styles of hunting, food, and rituals they do. its a breath of fresh air and its what I really wish we would get in Canada instead of what we've been forced to watch for years at school and even outside it.overall the show is everything I could've asked for and I'm soo excited to see more9/10"
Senyoku no Sigrdrifa,"Well from the start I have to say that this show really needs the tag of CGDCT, 80% of the show is really that I know that the chapters need a form to build a history but no like this came on. They could have done it like in Strike/Brave Witches.I personally have a problem with the pick of the planes for the main squadron the Ki 44 and the He 100 is okey but the Gladiator for the main character plane? A biplane going like jet speed? idk It is strange, they not come up with something cooler idea? I know the Gladiator was...a good plane, but I do not like it I would have preferred the Swordfish instead at least it would have been funny. The other plane that bothers me is the MC 72 same, is it the only cool plane that you came up? the Italians had a lot of cool planes in the war. I know that the idea here is to bring not such common planes to the screen, but you can do it much better.The history is the same as the other shows like this, planes piloted by cute girls to destroy monsters, nothing much refreshing here.the good point of the show is:The music I like it and is well placed.The animation is super nice the effects are really the best of the show.In general, the entire of the show appeared a ton of planes I like that a lot, but at the same time it bothers me because they could have taken planes from there to the main cast.I think if they could develop a better fitting history it could be a really good anime. the first chapter (45m) I was really good and the ending 11 and 12 it is an ok but in between is only CGDCT stuff.If you are here to watch girls doing CGDCT this is for you, but if you are here to watch a history military anime (like me) just what the first and the 11 12 chapters."
Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru.,"Oregairu isn't necessarily bad; it's a decent season. I mean, it could be worse, but not because of the protagonist or the plot, but rather due to the pointless and non- essential characters in the protagonist's development.Hachiman, who has an interesting perception of others, is forced to change after his teacher, Hiratsuka, forces him to join the service club. This happens after a disastrous practice session, which she believes won't help him in the future.To generalize, I don't want to explain every detail because, firstly, the secondary characters, aside from Yuig ahama and Yukinoshita, are empty, not bad, but empty. Zaimokuza is the only decent...one because, although he provides comedic relief, it's coherent, which doesn 't appear in the second season. I find it sad because he was the only decent character among the rest.The initial relationship between Hachiman and Yukinoshita fascinates me. It's incredible how they communicate and share certain things in common, like how they combat their own ideals regarding their loneliness and how they face it every day in the service club. I love their relationship.Ironically, Yukin oshita from the first season took center stage in general. But that's okay; she's a good character this season. Yuigahama, a clingy character, has a sincere heart, which is demonstrated throughout the series. She's not a bad character; she's decent and genuinely expresses sincerity towards Hachiman and Yukinoshita, making her a coherent character. I like her.As for the rest, they appear out of nowhere without any order. It feels a bit rushed, especially since there were already over seven characters after five episodes. I can understand this due to adapting six volumes in the first season. At least, I wish they had adapted more, because, honestly, these empty characters don't allow the protagonist to have his own time to think.Hachiman, in this season , is a character with an excellent introduction regarding his thoughts on youth and society in general. He's a unique character, not average, with humanity, sincerity, pessimism, but also logic in his thoughts. I don't think he's bad, but it's bad that he judges himself too much. Each person has their way of seeing things, but if he harms himself, then it wouldn't make sense for him to continue like that.That's why Hachiman is a great character; he has humanity, complexity, and depth. He's relatable, simply a good character, better than most average anime characters that exist so far, and I hope there are more like him, not necessarily like him, but better with better secondary characters and all that.That's why, for me, Hachiman is a 9/10. But, as I repeat, he's the only decent one. If the entire season had focused on him, I believe Oregairu would be a thousand times better.In some way, Hachiman and Yukinoshita saved this first season, which, thinking about it, is better than the third season. It's not that I hate Oregairu; it has one of the best protagonists I've seen, but unfortunately, the secondary characters ruin everything, making it feel empty.."
2.5-jigen no Ririsa,"These days I can barely watch more than 2 or 3 episodes of a new anime without finding it boring (I think almost all new anime look the same, and this one at first seemed like a cheap copy of My Dress-Up Darling (fortunately that's not the case)). But this one was surprisingly the opposite, I couldn't stop at the first one, I watched the first 5 episodes in a row. This anime is very funny, and I didn't feel like it had boring parts or unnecessary dialogue, not to mention the more moving parts that were very good.Well, I'm very happy to have seen...this anime and know that good anime still appear from time to time."
Mushikaburi-hime,"The fact that I watched this to the end is proof of my desire for more anime’s of this genres because I kinda hated this show. I hated it so much that this is my first review. Cliches galore but beyond that the mc is just hopeless. Like girl go bury yourself in a ditch with your favourite books already let someone more interesting have a go. This should be rewritten as one of those otome isekais where a more interesting (or really anyone else) takes over her life and story. As a bookworm, I had high hopes for this but sis is irritating. She...does nothing. She is supposed to be smart but seemingly has no sense of awareness or perception of social cues. A lion could lead this girl into a den, eat her and all she’ll say is hai.I tried to forgive her in the beginning but after episode 5/6 and her endless desire to just walk into traps, never fend for or defend herself or again really do anything of note but wait for the prince to come save her. I give up. I thought I can be passive but girl makes me feel like Joan of arc. A child literally bullies her at one point. It’s ridiculous. No one is this timid . Her character infuriated me so much I can’t even tell you who else was on this show. Everyone else is meh. Classic mean girl, princes (all the tropes), etc. this girl has everything on a platter but chooses to find problems where there are none, never communicates or ask questions and just blindly agrees to everything that is asked of her.The only reason I continued to watch it is because I’m a sucker for a classic old timey romance and I needed to fill my cup with something. I am a fish in a desert so I did see it through to the end but I hated most moments of it. I especially hate the writers who could have been lazy while producing something watchable but decided to just give us nothing. Not a single f. This is the laziest story I’ve ever seen and I’ve seen things.Watch it if you like the genre but prepare to probably hate it and especially hate the mc"
Look Back,"Tatsuki Fujmoto's one-shot Look Back serves as a love letter to the creative artistry behind manga. The short story follows two middle schoolers, Kyomoto and Fujino, two names that form a portmanteau in Fujimoto’s own surname when split. Fujino is a popular kid and happens to draw 4-koma manga strips for the school newspaper, and this success bolsters her ego through the roof. Until she sees Kyomoto's work published in the same paper and is in awe of her rival's artistic talent, an obsession to be better grows. As the saying goes, comparison is the thief of joy, but in this case, competition is directly...correlated to improving her skills. The film shows her hard work as taxing, harming her studies, and such, but ultimately, it is clear to the viewer that she had fun. It's exciting to have a goal, something to chase. This contrasts Kyomoto, an agrophobe yet incredibly skilled at background design. Look Back essentially chronicles their unlikely partnership, then subsequently a friendship.The film is narratively thin, although that's not inherently a downside, just a mere fact. There isn't much to work with given the nature of the concept and the emotion-centric storytelling. Whatever material director Kiyotaka Oshiyama has, he presents with fidelity. A large segment of the film is montages, probably one too many. It mostly works though, typically characterizing the two girls as well as the shift in their dynamic. Each of these sequences depicts various facets of the craft as well, showing them putting months upon months of work into a manga. While the combinations of successive shots condense time, the backgrounds show the sun rising and falling as the seasons change. The layout of Fujino's room becomes increasingly cramped, but as long as they have a desk to work on, the drawings continue. A number of the montages parallel each other in the same timeframe but characterize different aspects of the two girls' relationship. Evidently, the connection they develop is the central focus, particularly how attachments should be avoided by professionals. The only thing constant is change, and it is inevitable that a creator will want to hone their abilities, thus creating distance from those around them.Look Back is studio Duran's first feature-length project since being founded in 2017, and while Oshiyama (co-founder) has a plethora of experience under his belt, he hasn't been at the helm in years. It's important that we address the quality of the film because it becomes an indispensable part of the experience. The color grading in the film bears a tremendous weight in shaping the mood of a scene. Take something as simple as Fujino grabbing Kyomoto's hand and running down a street, for instance. A moment as simple as this has the backgrounds muted out in slow motion as Fujino and Kyomoto happily jog. This is standard for most films with scenes of that nature, but the innate inclusion of peripheral movement allows the mise en scène of the rising action to stand out. We see this during montage sequences often, such as light refraction, or a potent example would be the first shot of Fujino brainstorming at her desk. The body language shows an acute attention to detail like ticks that mangaka may have, and something as trivial as pen spinning adds a bit more personality. Oshiyama opts for rotoscoped character animation, leveraging the technique in prolonged shots where facial expressions sell the emotion.Much of what Look Back offers points to a capable adaptation, and I would identify it in that light for the better part of the film. To put it bluntly, it could have been shorter. That includes accounting for all the material and not cutting corners. A shorter runtime doesn't solve a great deal, but there would be less thematic elongation and would subsequently create slightly more interpretation. Then again, if we zoom into the root of the narrative's bewilderment, it is clearly the third act. That style of incorporating a brutal turn of events has become the norm lately, so it has now become exactly what it opposed: a derivative plot device. Personally, I'm neutral on the storytelling pathing in that direction, but I fail to see any level of effectiveness in it. The story can operate without that act or even mimic the same sentiments with a vastly divergent conclusion. This trend of tearing down reality has felt increasingly cheap to me, a method of forcing the viewer to cherish the past. It doesn't help that the film's foreshadowing is extremely heavy-handed, which again is generally fine if it were content with introspecting the lives of young girls vying to be mangaka.Criticism aside, Look Back does have genuine watch value. There's one specific part of the writing that stands out, a thread that I would assume Fujimoto intentionally overlooked. Kyomoto is established as an artist, a visionary desperate to grow her skills. Fujino is never given that title, and it's consistently ambiguous as to why she draws manga at all. Originally, it was for recognition, maybe money, then jealousy, and lastly, perhaps for Kyomoto. Naturally, these are all perfectly valid reasons, and it's just as fine if none were true. Drawing because she doesn't know what else to do or isn't talented at anything else. Fujimoto's angle here hints at the universality of a job being just that, a job. And that is okay. In that same vein, the film has many feel-good messages to offer, painted in bright, warm hues. Composer Haruka Nakamura, who I've been familiar with for a long time now, is proficient at building up a string and piannisimo crescendo. He performs well here, and Oshiyama appropriately uses the score or douses a shot in silence. Look Back, even with its ups and downs, especially for a debut project, puts studio Durian on the map. If anything, it's a testament to Oshiyama needing longer original work. The opening shaky rotating shot is almost out of a Gaspar Noe film; similarly, the technical virtues positively overshadow narrative gaps. Art is cruel, and humans are like water in the face of it, moving whichever way the flow takes us."
Bungou Stray Dogs,"popular but not too overrated.this would be the phrase that i’d use to describe this anime in its entirety. while i do think this is popular for a good reason, i felt that some parts could’ve been better. the pacing was boringly slow at points & didn’t make a lot of sense some times. i understand the hype though.spoilers:i don’t like the fact that most of the story is based on atsushi having a bounty on his head, it feels like every other anime i’ve seen recently. it’s very predictable & not super original. dazai is funny but the fact that he uses the suicide...joke line is kind of off to me, idk.i think a lot of people will like this series because it is good, i just found it repetitive because it’s so similar to everything else that’s out right now."
Hand Shakers,"Oh my god. Just wow. I don`t understand all these negative reviews i don`t understand what people are expecting, or perhaps they`re just too used to the drawing style and can`t wrap their heads around this. But let me tell you, the amount fo detail in this Anime is CRAZY, and i mean crazy. Every single background character is animated as well as having every single detail on them. I did also enjoy the story quite a bit, the main characters Koyori and Tazuna really meshed together! Loved their little interactions and besides hey, Koyori`s just a waifu can`t deny it. But jokes aside, The...animation was super super fluid, the characters were super detailed, those camera angles were so unique and i really loved them, it just added to the emersion, made me feel like i was there with them running and fighting. The audio as well, was crispy clear, voice acting was spot on and it has funny moments as well as some sad moments that made you feel for the characters. This was truly a hidden gem, and i`m glad i watched it. I`ll never let anyone`s opinion persuade me intro not wathcing an anime, can you only imagine if i did, and i would`ve missed on this amazing little anime?! Huhu.Overall i give this anime a 9/10. That`s a minus one point from 10 just because i didn`t get to hear a conffession, BUT that doesn`t mean there isn`t one, i guess you`ll have to watch and find out for yourself!PS: Aparently W`z is a sequel to this anime 10 years into the future or something, but i`m not sure!"
Hitoribocchi no Isekai Kouryaku,"I'm really angry with the reviews people have been posting.Is it a generic Isekai anime? ABSOLUTELY, and that's not a problem. We've been getting multiple seasonal Isekai series for many years, and pointing it out as negative is stupid. It's like getting angry for seeing furniture at IKEA.""He is a loner, and he's always surrounded by people."" THAT'S THE POINT OF THE SHOW. He wants to be alone, but plot reasons make that impossible.You don't like this generic show? That is totally fine! Just don't poop on it.Getting angry because it's an Isekai like Mushoku Tensei, re:zero or overlord makes you look like a tourist...and really dumb. Imagine being angry because my seasonal romcom isn't Fruits Basket or Ao haru ride every single time, ""complex"" or ""deeper"" shows do not equal being better.Now the animation, it's average! Not the best but BY FAR not the worst this season. In my opinion the opening is cool.It truly saddens me that people watch things with comparisons in mind instead of just trying to enjoy things.It's just your average show man."
Kimi ni Todoke,"I really don't understand the hype for this show. It's currently rated at an 8.05 on here and I'm so confused.I get it was 2009, but the art style is very classic shoujo and dated. The cutesy moments are okay enough, but they get grading after a time because sawako is the most bland carbon copy female protagonist of all time. In general, I think I'm just tired of this type of show. So if you're still pretty new to romance anime and are going through the old ones first, you might enjoy it more.The main guy is pretty chill, although I forget his name...which is kind of a problem considering how much sawako says it. He's just kind of there though. He has enough charm because as male protagonists go he's fairly normal. In a genere filled with either a shoujo MC who's a cliche nervous wreck, or a MC who's ridiculously perfect in a cringey way, this guy was pretty chill. There just isn't that much to him at all. He's just there.Ryu was interesting. Him and Chii and the other girl were the only reason I got this far through the show. Ryu and Chiis dynamic, although pretty played out, was much more interesting then anything to do with the main girl. But their plot lines didn't really go anywhere either.There's a lot of typical 2000s romance anime drama in here, the shit you've seen a million times before, the timid MC crying over every misunderstanding under the sun. I think it's the fact that anime has got a little more realistic in terms of relationships and character dynamics nowadays, and the ones that aren't that come out now are the ones I don't enjoy as much.Dandadan and blue box are great examples of great modern romance, where there's internal drama but it's done in a grounded, realistic way. Even the losing heroine show that came out last season had that.Again, if this was like 5 years ago, I mightve enjoyed this show. It's similar to the miad sama era,a show I had fond memories on but rewatched a few years ago and struggled to get through it.Times have changed I guess.The art is pleasant enough, the soundtrack is mid af but fits the show well enough, the OP is pretty decent, I skipped the ending, and the voice acting is okay. I think the VAs were well cast and well performed (I watched the sub), its more that sawako as a character is so annoying so her voice needs to accommodate for that soft ""cute"" style of voice. But yeah, that's just another thing I'm sick of.If you're bored of timid main characters and shows that move at a snails pace and never feel like they resolve, don't watch this."
Totsukuni no Shoujo,"This is one of a kind blank canvas on a museum wall.If you are the kind of person that can see art in anything, you'll be amazed by this anime. It's going to tingle your imagination, because blantly, there's no story. As for me, I'm just a normal human being, not some kind of artistic genious, so in my mind this anime wasted my time.Art was unusual for anime genres, and many people will find it beatiful. Happily for them, the art stays consistent. So if you're an artistic genious that will enjoy the story (that is barely there), this kind of art will be...a great addition to that.It was a short movie, and while it didn't manage to portray much story, it did manage to bring up a ton of questions. About what the hell is going on. And as a typical, art, it want you to imagine the answers to these questions by using your imagination. I'm sure you artistic types will eat this shit up like ice cream on a sunny day, on the beach.For anyone non-artistically inclined, save your time.Thanks for reading~"
"Ore wa Subete wo ""Parry"" suru: Gyaku Kanchigai no Sekai Saikyou wa Boukensha ni Naritai","If you like this kind of gimmick anime with a strong but stupid mc, this one isn't actually bad. If you like Eminence in shadows but can't find anything to watch then I would recommend giving this a try. In terms of general anime, this isn't great but in terms of similar anime and anime in the isekai genre, this is better than most.On par with Shinmai Ossan Boukensha, Saikyou Party ni Shinu hodo Kitaerarete Muteki ni Naru.(The Ossan Newbie Adventurer, Trained to Death by the Most Powerful Party, Became Invincible)While Shinmai Ossan has a better ending, this anime does set up better for...a potential second season."
Serial Experiments Lain,"EnglishSerial experiment Lain is a brilliant and timeless anime. Being an anime that tells us so much about our current society even though it was released in 1998, this work is almost prophetic, it manages to bring to light part of the impacts that the internet has on our current society.Lain is an anime with a slow pace (which may make you sleepy at times) and which some people may find tedious, but I would say that even in this the anime says something. We are currently so used to consuming hyper-stimulating works that keep us hooked, that we stop seeing other more...significant works because we find them boring.The internet, being a field that encompasses so many people and information, becomes almost an ""other world"", a world full of frustrated, anxious and isolated people. We are so used to always being on social media that sometimes we question whether that ""me"" on social media is our true ""self"". And Lain brings this, and more, shows us how, because we feel frustrated and dissatisfied with our reality, we use the internet as an escapism, an escape so as not to feel useless. People even leave their own bodies aside, because they feel that this life is no longer something that is so meaningful, because the internet makes them feel more important and relevant. We end up leaving aside what matters most, our real life.PortuguêsSerial experiment Lain é um anime genial e atemporal. Sendo um anime que nos fala tanto sobre nossa sociedade atual mesmo tendo sido lançada em 1998, essa obra é quase que profética, ela consegue nos trazer a tona parte dos impactos que a internet faz na nossa sociedade atual.Lain é um anime com um ritmo lento, (que talvez te dê sono em alguns momentos) e que algumas pessoas podem achar tedioso, mas diria que até nisso o anime fala algo. Nós atualmente estamos tão acostumados a consumir obras hiper estimulantes que nos mantém vidrados, que deixamos de ver outras obras mais significativas por acharmos tediosas.A internet, sendo ela um campo que abrange tantas pessoas e informações se torna quase que um ""outro mundo"", um mundo cheio de pessoas frustradas, ansiosas e isoladas. Estamos tão habituados a sempre estarmos nas redes sociais que as vezes nos questionamos se aquele ""eu"" das redes sociais é o nosso verdadeiro ""eu"". E Lain traz isso, e mais, nos mostra como nós por nos sentirmos frustrados e insatisfeitos com a nossa realidade, usamos a internet como um escapismo uma fuga para não nos sentirmos inúteis. Pessoas chegam a deixar de lado seus próprios corpos, por sentirem que essa vida não é mais algo tão significativo, porque a internet os faz se sentirem mais importantes e relevantes. Acaba que nós deixamos de lado oque mais importa, a nossa vida real."
Ooi! Tonbo 2nd Season,"What a wild ride we've all been on who decided to stick with Oi Tonbo for a second season, and as such I've been moved to once again write a view for this show—as it deserves people talking about it.As I stated in my review for season 1 of Tonbo, THAT show was not really about golf, but rather a semi-philosophical confrontation between its two main characters about what was important in life—all played out through the ""medium"" of golf.When season 2 for Tonbo was announced, I was very worried that it would be unable to live up to and continue what has quickly become...one of my favourite shows of all time. Oi Tonbo season 1 is a VERY complete story, and it didn't really feel like it needed to continue. So where did that leave the creators of season 2?The answer is that the creators of Oi Tonbo season 2 clearly knew that they couldn't recapture what made season 1 so special and complete, and instead they simply ""decided"" to do the next best thing; telling a truly excellent sports anime story in the more classic style. Said differently, where season 1 wasn't really about golf, THIS show very much IS about golf, and more specifically the feelings that the people playing it has for the sport, thus reminding me of other sports animes such as Captain Tsubasa or similar.No, Oi Tonbo season 2 might not be something ""unique"" like its predecessor was, but where it shines is in telling a story about the ""joy of sport"" in the best way; focusing on a diverse group of heroines, all with their own unique styles and struggles when it comes to the game they play. And it is all very engaging to watch as these characters try to outdo each other in their own special ways—and all while standing in awe at the oddball antics of our protagonist. Indeed, though Tonbo is our main character, as one watches the show, it is hard not to root for all of her rivals. The viewer comes to like all of them and wanting to see them succeed.Said simply, with Oi Tonbo season 2 we once again have a very good show on our hands. And watching it feels like spending time with old friends after not seeing them for a while.I hope this review has been helpful and thank you for reading."
Hand Shakers,"Let me start off by saying, give this anime a chance. Please. I implore you to actually try this anime out, go for it with an open mind - that's the best way to enjoy anything. Same as all anime, three-episode rule here works very well, once you've watched three episodes you'll understand the gist of the plot and how the anime will play out so if you don't enjoy it at this point - drop it.Story: 8/10. The story here is actually quite cool, the premise being the desire to meet God is fairly similar to that of Undead Unluck without the promised wish...and the fact that God isn't evil. In this anime, there are people called ""hand shakers"" and they can enter a place called ""Ziggurat"" when they hold their designated ""hand"" partner, in the ""Ziggurat"" they have special powers that fit the person's personality.Characters: 7/10: The main characters are a boy and a girl who are ""Hand Shakers"", the boy is forced into trying to secure a wish from God as if the girl were to spend to long without holding his hand, she'll die. The characters are fine, they do their job and to be honest there's not much to complain about or write about here.Sound: 8/10: banger OP. Otherwise not much note-worthy things, pretty cool piano at times.Animation: 6/10: here's where there are some clear issues... it's not that it's necessarily bad, it does it's job and it's definitely not unwatchable, however it's a very unique style that some people may not like having said this one should still give this a go and see if the animation grows on them.Overall Enjoyment: 7/10: Banger opening, lovely piano, some light-hearted comedy and romance sprinkled in makes this a wonderful watch for when you just want to wind down. With action scenes as well there really isn't much wrong with this anime and it get's heavily hated on for not a lot of good reasons. Having said all this I will admit that it is flawed - what anime isn't? Seriously. Look at your favourite show and tell me you can't find a *single* thing wrong with it, whether that be an episode, a character, a scene, a design choice. So again to end off, try this anime out, it's not like you're losing anything by doing so and again, go in with an open mind, be open to the animation choice and accept that there are some flaws in the animation at times (specifically in the one particular fight)."
Cyberpunk: Edgerunners,"*No spoilers*SummaryCyberpunk: Edgerunners is a series based off the Cyberpunk videogame series. As the title suggests, the series follows a cyberpunk theme, set in a dystopian world. The main character engages in a series of cybernetic implants and procedures to become a stronger Edgerunner. Along the way, the story explores themes of classism, social pressures, poverty, loss, grief, and power. It starts of wonderfully and sticks to these themes, though is feels rushed halfway through and falls into a cycle of action rather than focusing on the characters. If you are interested in the action genre, then this may be of interest to you.Story: 7/10The...worldbuilding in this anime is wonderful. It opens the door to so many possibilities while highlighting the cruelty of poverty in this dystopian city. The viewer is introduced to the protagonist, David Martinez, as he learns about a life changing loss. The plot thickens as more characters are introduced, and the worldbuilding continues, accordingly. However, the pacing begins to accelerate at this point, and the anime focuses more on action. There are also some unanticipated scenes that seem unnecessary. For instance, there’s just a random bunch of robot boobies flying around in the middle of one scene, and it doesn’t add anything but cringiness to the storyline.Around the midway point, the action exceeds the character development, and this is when the story feels  less impactful. The characters that were originally introduced go through abrupt changes (see the characters section) which detract from the cohesion of the story, and the anime focuses more on action and plot twists. Although the ending is anticipated (no spoilers), based on the genre and foreshadowing, there isn’t enough time to appropriately build up the characters within the plot. Instead, it seems as though the second half is an action-lovers fan fiction. The story focuses less on morals, personality, and characters’ decisions, and more on battles. The changes in the main character’s behavior are exceptionally abrupt because of the action and emphasis on combat. Near the end, there are also plot twists and identity twists that provide nothing helpful for the story and diminish the quality of the ending. Cinematically, there is a beautiful scene with a popular song playing, but the viewer is less likely to be as emotionally invested after the jerking plot and identity reveals. Overall, the story started interestingly with important and meaningful themes and excellent worldbuilding. From there, it focused less on characters’ intentions and more on the violence within the dystopian society. This would have been fine if the pacing weren’t accelerated beyond comprehension and didn’t overlook the pivotal moment of characters’ changes. Overall, it is still a great story, and I do recommend it; however, it had more potential that was squandered in the second half.Characters: 6/10David Martinez starts as an excellent protagonist who provides context and perspective to his dystopian world. He makes decisions at the start of the story which propel the plot and help him to grow. Characters like Lucy and Rebecca are interesting, although they don’t have enough time to shine. The character designs are the highlight and are quite unique. Unfortunately, romance and friendships seem forced, especially with the rapid pacing of the story. There isn’t enough reasonable tension and growth between the characters to portray realistic relationships, and that’s partly because the anime is only ten episodes. Beyond this, some characters seem to have been written simply to make the story seem more profound in an unexplained way. This results in extra edginess by using strange dialogue and profanity that doesn’t fit the situation. Furthermore, the characters tend to fall short in development because their backstories are nonexistent. If the series were more fleshed out and focused on the characters instead of the action, then this story would have been excellent, and the characters would have been well above average.Art: 6/10The art is slightly above average. The art style is fitting for the world, although it makes some of the fighting and action scenes challenging follow, particularly with the use of certain angles.Sound: 6/10The soundtrack is average. I’m sure that people love the song near the end, as it was a song that was popularized and used for a particular emotional scene. Aside from this, the soundtrack is relatively forgettable.Enjoyment: 6/10Cyberpunk: Edgerunners had been hyped up and, while it did not meet my expectations, it was still enjoyable. There are some emotional scenes, although I felt that the pacing was unnecessarily fast. The end had completely needless twists in a character’s identity, the main character suddenly changed between episodes, and the second half felt tremendously rushed. I always watch a series twice before reviewing, and the excessive action in the second half was even more disappointing the second time. The old saying that “less is more” could have been applied to this show and would have gone a long way. I would still recommend this to people interested in the genre, but I feel that this anime had so much potential that was wasted by the end because it crammed excessive action into a ten-episode series and neglected the characters.Total score: 6.2 good)"
Little Busters!,"The bad first. Little Busters is a story about making friends, loving eachother, being happy, etc. Its a Key anime adaptation, so I didn't really expect anything else. I'm not particularly against that type of theme but where Little Buster's really goes wrong is with its delivery. The melodrama, strange dialogue, awkward pacing, and boring characters really made me want to drop it early on, but my masochistic tendencies pushed me to continue watching (for research obviously). Its important to note that I haven't played the VN, which from what I understand is very good, so I don't have any source material to really compare...this adaptation to, but I held out nonetheless. While the majority of the show was as described (boring, bad, stupid, etc.) it actually started to pick up in the last few episodes (the last 6 I believe) and actually started to interest me. Now I don't want to give any passes to lazy producers and bad writing, but I do grant that adapting a VN doesn't really work to well. It's nearly impossible to fully adapt the functions and intricacies of the VN. The multiple routes and character arcs have to all be stuffed into one linear timeline, and that doesn't lend itself to being exactly like the VN. So, in conclusion, overall, I didn't enjoy this anime very much, but the last few episodes made me want to watch the Refrain route, which I've heard is very good."
Tsuki ga Kirei,"Hmmmm, how should I put this, this anime feels like it was done by a passionate and talented, but ultimately amateur And unpolished team and writer. As a preface, I dont know anything about the studio and the original manga/ln if it has one, so if you want a real smart review including those factors, I have to let you down. I can only speak about the anime itself.The story is quite simple, with some minor twists that rather make the plotline artifically longer than add real value, but some of them actually are pretty nice plot points about coming of age/romance/coming of age romance....I personally liked the story, but I can understand if someone would find it too slow or too forced at points. I both liked the ending and hated it. Without spoiling, lets just say, you should watch the end credits of the last episode. Sometimes we cant get what we want in life, or have to compromise. This was a good plot point of the anime, including that even when those happen, we can make the most out of it (Dont worry, minor spoiler, but they stay together at the end, your heart wont be broken).But as I said before, the story can feel pretty forced with minor drama, which only makes it longer, not more meaningful. Which is in turn an interesting choice, because a good 2-3 more episodes after the last ones could have been easily fit in and would have made it way better, instead of the drama.I think this is one of those rare shows that actually starts out weak and gets stronger until the end.The characters are a pretty mixed bunch, more like they vary wildly in portrayal troughout the show, which is a feat in itself, as the anime is only 12 episodes long.We are dropped in the middle of everything (not the romance itself), and there are many characters, who are portrayed inconsistenly (as mentioned above) so establishing the relationships between the charactera are pretty hard. It does not help, that all characters' faces look the same with different hair and body (more on this later in the art section).The MC and FMC are at least have a life of their own (which a lot of romance anime seems to forget) and they are pretty okay characters for a romance anime. Especially at the end, they are great characters. At the beginning however they can be pretty annoying. I think the writers wanted to portray the confusion of first love and feeling lust for the first time, but insted got confused of what could the confusion be like, and that confusionception made the characters just flat out annoying. Like my girl (FMC) somehow puts negative effort into the relationship in the first few episodes, while being portrayed as someone in love. Instead of an awkward first love it feels like an asshole and a half (maybe Charlie Sheen wrote the first half of the script, but he forgot the comedy part). She also starts the minor drama, or more like it starts because of something she either did or did not do, and has the audacity to act righteous and offended most of the time at the beginning. Like dude, shut yo b*itch ass up you did that. Luckily after the first few episodes the MCs get better as their relationship progresses (and then the side characters get reeeeeal annoying, but you will see it for yourself, I dont want to spoil it).The sound is, well..... an interesting one. Remember that I wrote the whole things looks (and also sounds) like a real amateur work? It can be heard on the soundtrack as well. The OP and ED are the standard emotional and beautiful, albeit not groundbreaking songs, I liked them, they are pretty much a vibe, a romantic vibe. The BGM is also oretty good songs on the same principle as the OP and ED, but for some reason, instead of the soundtrack making olace for the scene and supporting it, the soundtrack gets blasted at full volume during some emotional scenes, which completely overshadows the scens and makes them worse, instead of elevating them, like literally I had to constantly adjust the volume. There are also some weird sound choices for everyday sounds, like cars honking sounding weird, shoes sounding weird in some scenes, but you really have to listen to notice those.The art. Dayumm.Now this is where the anime really bled out in a puddle. I dont want to drag this out, if you watch the anime you will see the glarinfly obvious things, lets just name a few:-Shading being a white stripe on the characters' head most of the time-Weird moving animation (when one of your main characters is a oretty good track athlete, having weird moving animations is a real scene killer)- Physically hurting CGI and 3D animation, usually when there are a lot of characters in the background. It is like the wii characters, but even more distorted. The best is when we have a member of fhe main cast in the foreground animated normally, and we have these weird CGI wii characters going on about their wretched days in the background. After a while I found it funny and amusing, but really did not help the anime.- Characters just existing for 10 seconds without moving/talking/doing anything. And not in normal still shots, but in the middle of the conversation. It really kills the momentum of conversations and sometimes emotional scenes, which makes the characters sometime look even more bland and annoying than they initially looked like.So all in all, this is a passionately, but low budget made, pretty okay story about a coming of age romance. It wont make your head spin, but it is fun and wholesome, with some annoying forced drama moments.To be fair, I rather see a good story, with shit animation, than a shit story with godly animation. The story here was not THAT good, but it was pretty fun, and I do not regret watching this. It wont be my favourite, but it will be a hidden, niche comfort anime of mine. Worth a watch, but probably wont go around buying merch for it.Have a nice day"
Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka V: Houjou no Megami-hen,"pretty simply its danmachi season 5 and it does well to flip things on its head and continue and resolve previous plot lines. Danmachi has a simple idea behind it, it wears its inspiration on its sleave, mythology. Following those footsteps its trying to be a classic story where a person with special abilities tries to become a hero. Some would argue he's a gary stu theyre right but so are the mythological hero's that inspired this story.It does fall into the trappings of anime though so something to keep note of for sure with the harem thing if you can get over that...theres a solid story behind it."
Delico's Nursery,"+ Both the artstyle and backgrounds are pretty unique. When combined with the colours used, the final result is a great fit for the atmosphere and setting of this series.+ The frequent fights are thoroughly animated and a joy to observe.+ The premise is incredibly creative, while the setting itself is pretty rare for anime.+ The cast is notably large and handled really well. All of the relevant characters get a satisfying characterisation and many of them undergo development that feels justified and organic. Given the length of the series and the size of the cast, it is executed very exemplarily.+ Dali Delico - the...protagonist - is a really witty, nonchalant and fun character to follow.+ The children are written in a realistic manner and feel different from each other (apart from the twins being similar).+ The soundtrack is a banger."
Acro Trip,"AcroTrip is an anime that stands out for its innocent humor and characters who, while a bit silly (or a LOT), are truly endearing.The pacing is somewhat weird, but not in a bad way; it adds a unique touch that keeps the viewer intrigued.One of the strong points of AcroTrip is its excellent voice acting, which brings the characters sillyness to life.The anime doesn't take itself too seriously, which is a good thing, as it allows viewers to relax and enjoy without any pressure, perfect for those moments when you just want to unwind and have a good time. Also, it keeps you...wondering what on earth is going on with Chrome/Kuroma, adding a mysterious element that hooks you in.AcroTrip is a hidden jewel"
"Benriya Saitou-san, Isekai ni Iku","Handyman Saitou in Another World is an isekai that tried to be different from the usual ""generic"" stuff you'd expect from the genre but did it in a rather unique and out of the box way. My short reccomendation is, if you like slice of life mixed with comedy or character focused anime with a bit of comedy, or have watched and liked animes like Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, Slime Diaries, or Encouragement of Climb this anime is probably for you.First let's hits things off with those FLAWS, I've gotta be negative sometimes right? Jk. Let's start with...the story and plot, because on the whole it's pretty simple and barebones. It's basically Saitou who worked as a handyman ends up in another world, and joins a party of eccentric adventuring individuals to be their ""handyman"", basically he just picks locks on chests and helps fix some of their gear. So if you wanted to watch this for the ""handyman"" part of it, they have it but it's pretty barebones and not too much of the selling point or focus. There really isn't too much of a plot or story here instead it focuses more on it's characters and comedy than anything else. I suppose the best way to put it is, here or there they'll make a short story/plot centered around a specific character that lasts for 1 or maybe 2 episodes and that's that. If you've seen Violet Evergarden (which you totally should if you haven't already), think of this like having the short character stories from some of it's episodes but without a larger plot or other things going on alongside it and in general the character stories not being not quite as good. On the whole the lack of more story and plot in this show is the biggest thing holding it back, however it still manages to be entertaining and a good watch despite that.Next let's get to those characters which is this show's biggest positive alongside, THE COMEDY!! The first 3-4 episodes is pretty much all comedy and nothing else. There's a bit of those character stories I mentioned coming in after that but there's still a lot of comedy mixed in with those too. The main 4 are pretty good characters and overall quite funny, especially Morlock. I kid you not this senile old man carries HALF the comedy in this show. Even when this show tries to be serious he's usually mixing comedy in with it. On the whole it makes the show pretty entertaining which is nothing but a good thing. Raelza on the whole is an alright character, it's obvious from episode 1 she has a crush on Saitou and while she does have more going for her character than that it's not the focus as much partly due to this shows use of comedy. Lafanpan is decently funny also but didn't have much else going for her. They tried to give her character some more depth around the 4th episode but they didn't go far enough IN-DEPTH (sorry) with her background and such to bring her up to par with the rest, maybe they can fix that if we get a second season. I mentioned Morlock earlier but he's not just carrying the comedy in this show. Bro also has the most interesting backstory and more depth than any other character in this show, while also being the flattest piece of comedy in the entire show. Saitou himself is honestly pretty basic and flat compared to the other characters, he's not outright bad by any means but he could've used some more work and fleshing out. I wont talk too much about side characters but on the whole they're fine and fulfill their comedy jobs pretty well.Ahh my favorite part of this show, the production. C2C is back at it again and they simply don't miss, the art style is somewhat unique and is drawn more than well enough for this show. But the animation here is top notch, C2C have pretty much always been slapping way larger studio's animation in the face by having far more detailed, expressive and fluid movement in EVERYTHING they've animated. Heck Moonlit Fantasy was an anime they'd worked on for it's first season and the animation went straight downhill when JC Staff took over for the 2nd season even if they did the art well enough. So on the whole having C2C producing this has been nothing but a godsend for it's animation production quality, this studio NEVER fails to impress me there. The voice acting is on par to the standard you'd expect from anime, music and audio production are both very good, they're not anything top tier but they easily do the job well enough.On the whole The Superb Senile Adventures of the Magnificent Magician Morlock, oops sorry I meant Handyman Saitou in another world. It's a show that's simple story wise, but overall entertaining and a worthwhile watch that'll probably give you a few laughs. It's nothing amazing and certainly doesn't go without is fair share of flaws and problems but it's very easy to recommend due to it's strengths and most would likely find this a good watch due to that 7/10."
Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi,"No matter how many times I watch Spirited Away, I am never not impressed. Everything is just done perfectly. This isn't just the best animated movie of all time, this is one of the best movies of all time. I'll just start off by saying: I have no complaints about anything! I wish I could have something to complain about so that it's not just an endless series of ""This is good, that is good, etc."" So instead, I won't mention what I like, but I will explain puts Spirited Away on a whole different level than ""a movie that does everything well"".The atmosphere goes...beyond perfect. It can be whimsical. However, it can even be a bit creepy at times, which is strange since this is a family movie. There are spirits with strange and uncanny appearances everywhere. Sometimes they look at the Chihiro (the MC) and you can just feel the tension in the air. The strange stares, the feeling of not belonging in the spirit world, the sense of danger. It's all portrayed perfectly through subtle means like the atmosphere and expressions. The creepiest character in the show doesn't even talk, but you can still accurately infer his emotions.Every frame of this movie is worthy of being a painting by itself. It is so beautiful and I love the constant variety of scenery. From the green meadows to the lantern lit bathhouse to even a dimly lit forest trail. It was so pleasant to stare at. If you want an example, type ""hopping lantern spirited away"" on Google and look how a simple scene can be so beautiful with just good coloring.There is something I appreciate a lot about Studio Ghibli movies and especially the ones directed by Hayao Miyazaki. They can make even the most boring concepts fun to watch. I have never been entertained by watching people climb stairs as I have been in Studio Ghibli movies. Even during the most basic tasks, they make sure to consider and portray what the character feels at every moment.There are also some very nice subtle themes hidden here and there. In Spirited Away there are hints to concepts such as prostitution and human trafficking or even the environment. If you're a person who likes reading between the lines, there's a fair bit of that here."
Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku,"Finally, something decent in the entire series!After the disastrous first season in terms of script and subplots, we arrive at the second season, which is the best of the three. I say this with pride because it's the best I've seen so far. This season has finally included the seriousness and complexity we've been craving since the first season. Thankfully, the stupid romantic comedy isn't present in this season, which makes me incredibly happy.Firstly, the animation has changed for the better. The characters look much better than before, with more realistic expressions and conversations. The scenarios are also much better, and if they had...animated the first season like this, I believe it would have been peak Oregairu. Unfortunately, that's not the case, thanks to the deplorable third season.Hachiman has had more screen time in the first five episodes, and I love that. It's something that was lacking in the first season. The seriousness and the relationships between Yui, Yukinoshita, and Hachiman finally have some drama and complexity. We can finally understand Hachiman's feelings, perception, monologues, and intentions better. He's becoming a more complete and coherent character, making him more relatable, but that doesn't mean he's better.Once again, pointless characters that serve no purpose appear, but as the series becomes more serious, they at least become decent characters. Unfortunately, hateful characters like Iroha and Orimoto still exist, and I genuinely don't understand the need to include them.Hachiman's development is what stands out the most in this season. His attempts to question everything he's been doing so far regarding the service club and his relationships with Yuigahama and Yukinoshita make the series worth watching. Because it doesn't fall into the usual clichés, it's good, excellent, and incredible. It tackles genuine issues in a pretentious yet pertinent way. That's what Hachiman is searching for, in some way, he finds it. If only the series focused on these three characters, it would be good.The teacher, Hiratsuka, is a hateful character in the first season, but in this one, she becomes someone decent and fundamental to Hachiman's development. Everything makes sense, everything is coherent, and that's what I love.So, I highly recommend this season, although I only focus on the good aspects because the unnecessary characters and subplots, like the school events, are so horrible that they bore me. I only focus on the development, which is the only thing worth watching in this second season, not the service club cases, which I find scarce and pointless. Thankfully, they 're not as important in this season."
Undead Unluck,"Undead Unluck is one of the most interesting, creative, and emotionally moving stories Ive had the pleasure to READ, not watch; though the anime is still solid overall.  The anime hits a lot of the same highs as its manga counterpart, but is watered down by incessant recaps, underwhelming 3d effects, and a few altered scenes.  And unfortunately like the manga, you will need to get past the first couple of episodes which have some mild notes of sexual assault, which is promptly dropped less than 5 episodes in, never to return again.  All that being said though, it is still absolutely...worth a watch, if for no other reason that it will be a gateway to get more people to read, and I mean this when I say it, one of the greatest manga of all time.  If you want a more in-depth look into my thoughts on the series, my main review of Undead Unluck is on the manga's page."
Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou,"Since Arifureta is complete dogshit in every way, I would have given it a 2 and moved on. However, it is not satisfied with just being terrible. It also has to make you feel greasy, uncomfortable and disgusted while watching it. A big part of that is that they have a girl who looks and acts like a child. She is promptly sexualized and then shipped with the MC. But even if that is gone, there's just something about the art, the characters and the environment that just makes me feel like I have to take a shower.I cannot for the life of me remember...anything interesting that happened. I remember there was a badly animated and uncreative fight against a hydra which they defeated with the power of friendship. I remember that it was another wish fulfillment self insert power fantasy. I remember that after sexualizing the child (who is conveniently a vampire), they immediately make it clear that the MC will have an entourage of girlfriends. As for anything good? Nothing really comes to mind."
Delico's Nursery,"Delico's Nursery - A case of children's child-rearing and adults's usual conflicts at the same time in a non-traditional environment, but does this amount to anything significant at the end of the day?The criss-cross teeter-tattering of genres in this day and age for just about any given combination of genres can be good if the topic(s) are being understood and executed with meaning and purpose. Yet, for all that's worth, to have something that first existed outside of the AniManga industry and then made into those mediums with their own personal stories — this is exactly the setting premise of the dark, gothic fantasy series...known as TRUMP. Coming into existence in the form of Shakespeare-ish stage plays going back all the way to 2009 under the direction of playwright Kenichi Suemitsu, who has directed many stage play series the likes of this show, K (yes, that GoHands series) and Touken Ranbu, it has garnered quite the audience it has back home in Japan, and seemingly enough, a reason for Aniplex to order an anime adaptation that while is standalone, still serves part of the entire TRUMP series in general.When you look at shows that feature the childcare theme, that's the first hook that immediately gets its audience thinking what the show is all about. And yet this is exactly why Delico's Nursery, a standalone anime that's part of a series that features vampires in a fantasy, mystery setting, does right from the get-go, a pseudo-Buddy Daddies, if you will, in its given context. The standalone story of Delico's Nursery, where the tally of its serial murders threatens to derail its vampire society, leaving only a trace of a hint/clue that leads its followers to the culprit responsible: TRUMP - the True of Vamp, the origin of all vampires. And the taskforce behind this investigation is the vampire version of the US's Secret Service: the Vlad Agency, led by renowned and reputable noble aristocrats.However, this is a careful balancing act for the people of the taskforce being assigned to the intricate case: its leader of Dali Delico and his fellow colleagues of Gerhard Fra, Henrique Lorca and Dino Classico, are fathers to their own children, so the child-rearing aspect pretty much is a necessity amidst the tension of the investigation that the trail only grows more hotter and colder, adding to the fact that a once well-known criminal organization is adding pressure to the 4 gorgeous, handsome, but stuck-up vampire parents who have to play double duty with loved ones and enemies that would pander to the Shoujo audience all the more, while the Shonen audience gets to bite the mystery elements. Like I've said, think of Delico's Nursery as the vampire version of Buddy Daddies, and you'll be fine...at least for its first Act. The adults are somewhat out of their element since their wives are the ones doing all the child-rearing work, so to have the husbands of Dali, Gerhard, Henrique, and Dino find ways to entertain their rowdy children is in more ways than one, endearing with a soul for the pension of control, which gives some personality to get to know them for first impressions.Alas, while this show does know what it wants to be...trying to subvert its main topic with something that just naturally lines up, only for that to be very flawed does serve its bit of criticism. I find that the first Act of the child-rearing aspect (that covers the 1st half of the anime) was actually decent and not too bad to establish the ""happy-go-lucky"" scenarios of the 4 men having to tackle their children's wellbeing in Dali's house where said nursery resides in with Dali's kids of Raphael and toddler Ul, Gerhard's daughter Angelico, Henrique's twin sisters of Lucia and Elena, as well as Dino's only child of Theodore, which indefinitely put a lot (and I mean A LOT) of strain on the adults having to take care of the illusive ongoing serial murder case all at the same time. However, the second Act of dealing with the criminal organization was, in many ways, more overbearing than the child-rearing portion itself. To be fair, we don't exactly know a ton about the group and their notions, but it soon becomes clear that they're just your stereotypical outcasts who've been maligned in the High Society of vampires in some shape or form that they cannot conform to. As an example, one such repetitive aspect always being brought up is the Cocoon Stage, in which an unfledged vampire in the form of dhampirs evolves to become true vampires in order to thrive in the stereotypical dog-eat-dog world. Yet, for as much as the ""theology"" of the rejects does have their shit together with characters like Kiki and Catarina knowing that they're being outcasts but also modest at the same time, man, does the book of character development literally be thrown out of the window to try and make us feel tangent on their actions and purposes. The murder mystery plot is natural; everything else surrounding it is just plain laziness in its writing.Delico's Nursery being J.C.Staff's 2nd out of 9 shows for Summer/Fall 2024, you've got to give it to the studio being the sweatshop studio of the current AniManga industry pumping out shows with productions at both low and high-end extremes of the spectrum, but yet surprisingly deliver each and every show in their own uniqueness. I'd say that the production of the show pretty much reminds me of Winter/Spring 2022's Baraou no Souretsu a.k.a Requiem of the Rose King, taking on the minimalist approach while letting everything else flesh all the same (production issues, is anyone surprised at this point)? Yet, for all its mediocre production and animation to boot, the show is tolerable and watchable if you give it the second chance it deserves, alongside the efforts of director Hiroshi Nishikiori's rather small staff team that includes the playwright scriptwriter Kenichi Suemitsu himself and a few others. It's pretty much almost a near-majority stake of both director and scriptwriter helming the show, and you can feel cohesiveness at the very least, even if the final product did or did not turn out what they want from the series (depending on how you look at it).The shining moment for the show has got to be its OST. Both Mika Nakashima and Anonymouz nailed the show with their OP and ED songs that give off the vampire mystery vibes, and for a first bout, Shunsuke Wada's first-ever anime music composition may not be a knockout, but it's still respectable.Ultimately, Delico's Nursery is a tale of two divides: either you appreciate the child-rearing and hate the serial murder case, or vice versa. I'm betting on the thought that you'd think that this show would be a take on Buddy Daddies by involving vampires, but that expectation is quite severely misplaced given what it chooses to place foremost, and then add the mystery motive that, for all intents and purposes, Buddy Daddies nails the overall premise more than this show could do either.Sure, there's the parenting theme that helps skew Delico's Nursery to a relatale degree, but this could've been so much better if there's a level of focus on elevating what to expect from a stage play adaptation into the anime, which is its biggest Achilles' Heel.This show should've just given up at its moment of hiatus, period."
IS: Infinite Stratos 2,"THIS IS A SPOILER-FREE REVIEWI recently watched the first season of 2011´s premier mecha anime “Infinite Stratos” a few months ago, and I got exactly what I wanted out of the show. Sure, the plot is non-existent, the characters are super one-dimensional and the whole setting is just a type of teenage-boy fantasy but sometimes, after watching a lot of heavy action or drama, i need something like this, and i was super excited to dive back into this light-hearted world.Story – 6/10My god, going back to this story after watching heavy-hitters like “The Tatami Galaxy” and “Macross” really gives your brain whiplash. Everything that...i wrote about the first season also applies to the second one. But the one big difference is that this time, the show actually sets up some storylines. Yes, you heard it right, there is actually a story this time around, and it mostly thematizes the Orimura family. We finally have villains in this show, instead of random encounters with remote controlled mechs that merely serve as little disruptions from the rom-com sections of the story. And although they didn´t show any type of motivation (at least so far, but we are already two seasons into the story!) it gave the show at least a tiny bit of a direction. Other than that, this is just your typical ecchi, rom-com. The show definitely shows it´s age here a little bit, but the sections are still a ton of fun if you are able to ignore your suspension of disbelief. Even though there is some action here, this is mostly a fun, light-hearted, highschool show with a little sci-fi twist.Art – 8/10This season follows up the already fantastic looking first one and continues to surprise me with it´s technical quality. Like i said, this show came out in 2011, a time where these kinds of shows definitely not receive the same amount of budget as today. Infinite Stratos does still look good. Great characters models, super expressive and fluidly animated. The fights in this season are also a joy to look at. Although the final fight did not have the same amount of emotional weight as the one in season one, it looked great from a technical standpoint. Super solid stuff overall.Sound – 6/10The first season has one of the coolest OP/ED combos I have heard in a long time, so the second season had some big shoes to fill in. The new combo is still pretty good, but not outstanding. The sound design is pretty crisps. The variety in weapons of our characters mechs in combination with the sound design makes it so that you can tell apart the different machines just from their sound, which i thought was pretty damn cool. But overall, the BGM is nothing special.Characters – 6/10Man, they really went a bit overboard this time around. The show just keeps introducing new characters all the time. We have 5 new characters that play an important part in the storyline who get introduced very fast. The villains are mostly comical. I could not really take them seriously (Like, where do they even have the resources for their insane technical equipment?). The only one that has at least a little bit of mystique around her persona is the third member of the Orimura family. But even that storyline, which should have been the main focus of this season, if you ask me, is severely underdeveloped. Ichika gets a little bit better this time around, but he still makes stupid decisions left and right.The only character who I thought was done really well this season was Sarashiki Tatenashi, who actually gets a little mini-arc all to herself. She has quickly become my favourite female character in the show (Which is hard, cause there is just one male character in the whole story).Enjoyment – 7/10This is the last anime season of Infinite Stratos. We will probably never get a season three after this many years. I am glad i watched this show, because i just love these kinds of stories where you just 100% know what you are getting, and Infinite Stratos has delivered exactly what i wanted. Every ecchi or rom-com fan should check this one out, even if you don´t like mecha as a genre. Everyone else...you know what you are getting into.- Marco_YoooFINAL SCORE - 6/10"
Charlotte,"Charlotte. A premise that seemed promising, but ultimately ended up being cliché and meaningless. Maybe it's one of those anime that had great potential, but was let down by poor animation and simplistic characters. You couldn't expect much from it, so it wasn't hard to expect it to be a bad anime. It's simply a generic, average anime with at least a decent soundtrack, but that doesn't save it from being generic. Only watch this anime if you're bored. And stop being swayed by what others say, just because it has some good scenes doesn't make it a good anime. Clearly, that's just my opinion,...I don't find anything good about it apart from the music, which even becomes annoying..."
"Maou-sama, Retry! R","I really wanted to like season 2 as much as I liked season 1...they got a different studio to do this one compared to the first season. I'll start with that, and all the trash that comes with a different set of brains and talent taking over.The first season was really good, for a bog standard isekai with an absolutely OP MC and a bunch of loli characters.The second season is very different, severely lacking in content and continuity, and most of it I spent my time trying to figure out what happened and where, why etc. The storytelling fell off hard with...the new studio, and if I was the creator of the original work, I'd demand some sort of restitution for how badly the new studio screwed this up.The characters don't even look the same. the 2 episode recap was not needed, and wasted valuable story time, not like the story mattered to the new studio, since they even changed some of the story from S1 in the recaps. There is some flipping between the isekai and the MC's past in those first episodes, and it's just confusing, since there isn't any warning in the switch.the cast is completely different except for the MC, so it has an entirely different feel to it. This is a second season that should have never happened IMO. Studio Gekkou absolutely ruined this one. If they couldn't get the original studio, then it shouldn't have happened.The OP and ED are lacking as well. all in all, being a bog standard isekai, the 2nd season misses the mark completely. If this is your chosen genre... i'd say skip this one, as it doesn't hold to the first season, nor does it flow well."
Dadao Chaotian,Dadao Chaotian is a sword cultivation isekai-ish donghua. This donghua is very unique. It present the story in future-tense narrative. While at the same time mix in element of past-tense narrative hence isekai-ish. Very unique way of presenting the story and overall a very unique cinematography story telling.The story is about Jing yang. A grandmaster of shenmo peak who failed at ascension. Now have to start all over again in his new body as Jing jiu.I myself have not read the original novel so I do not know the main story. But because of the way this donghua unique ways of telling the story It...makes it very unique as if you skip forwarded in time knowing what will happened but stuck in the present at the same. Truly a masterpiece of story telling.
Mahou Shoujo ni Akogarete,"Highest level of degeneracy for the sake of being a degenerate show for degenerates. Basically about a degenerate f4g0tt who goes around r*pping kids. Its basically what the gooners call the mind break genre, where the f4g07s rape the heroines until they submit or even begin to love it. Yes it is thus outright porn, not an anime where there isnt a coherent or consistent plot.I am not one to appreciate or enjoy degeneracy, there are some works of art which contains it but justifies it existence by relating it to the story. The problem with this anime is that it is outright porn censored...to a certain extent which is in an unwatchable level when the ""action"" starts happening.Maybe it is an accurate representation of LGBT community, where we observed them grooming and SA them in public schools stats(USA) which out competes the priests. The onl difference is that the church and priests doesnt defend the r*pists like the former community."
NHK ni Youkoso!,"Animation/Artwork/Overall Aesthetic: 1/2There's nothing to brag or complain about here.Music/Sounds/Overall Audio: 1/2I didn't care for the intro/outro music and found it easily skippable, but there were plenty of moments where the background music fit the scene well.Characters/Character Development: 2/2Each main character felt significant to the story and greatly impacted one another. They all had their part to play and showed a progressive change in one direction or the other throughout the entire series.Plot/Overall Story: 2/2At no point did the series drift away from or forget its main plot. It feels as if the writers knew exactly what they wanted to create in terms of the...overall story and the message it tells.Personal Impact/Significance/Overall Feeling: 2/2By the end of the series, the story (and characters) had a tight grip on me emotionally. I felt as if the writers had a clear vision and message that they were telling from beginning to end. I found the characters relatable and the message told by the story has me reflecting on my own life. This won't be an anime I forget anytime soon.Overall Rating: 8/10I loved it!"
Touhai: Ura Rate Mahjong Touhairoku,"So, this title is slowly getting past half of its season, and i Can only say that plot developement actually goes pretty hard.Although it's one of these titles that doesn't really explain much about Mahjong itself, making potential watcher pretty confused about outplays, it's whole ultra-pompous vibe does well projecting addiction to gambling and insanity of people being ready to die for another game just for the gist of excitement and adrenaline.Visuals of this anime are pretty mid, music also... But there are some characters that are very much likeable. Especially Ice Cold K, as a protagonist is pretty well written one, with pretty good...plot where his good deeds clash with his insane gambling addiction.The best thing that this title actually does, is being serious. Yakuza is real, mean and brutal. People loosing their whole life savings, going into enormous debts and being brutally punished is seen on episode basis.To sum up, i can only recommend this anime for mature audience that likes Gambling topic, or obviously Mahjong itself. Beside it's mediocre appearance. Title actually can pull off pretty well executed suspense, action and has this serious gangster vibe with exciting pacing."
"Eiyuuou, Bu wo Kiwameru Tame Tenseisu: Soshite, Sekai Saikyou no Minarai Kishi♀","Where do I even start? Honestly, this anime is just plain stupid. I can't believe a studio had the nerve to animate this trash, and I think I even saw it has a game adaptation. First off, the title is misleading where is the 'blade'? When all she does is kick and punch with mana, it should be called 'Master the Mana' instead of 'Master the Blade'.Plus, it's unclear who the actual enemy is throughout the series. And what about those Hyral Menas? What even are they? They’re described as weapons, but then they’re using weapons themselves? You only find out their true nature in...the last episode, which is just frustrating. And it's hilarious how Ripple suddenly mentions having a homeland out of nowhere, i thought they are produced? Fuck this shit, can we get some proper explanations? This was a confusing mess!While I'm at it, I have to mention that scene with the green-haired fake Highlander. Did they not realize what 'she will come instead' really implies? It’s pretty clear, she's a slut. Seriously, fuck who wrote this episode? You need to stop writing!!!And to top it all off, we never get any answers about Eris’s agitation, between Ripple and Silva, the relationship between the Holy Knights and the Hyral. What do they mean by 'paid a high price'? This is just a bunch of confusing nonsense bullshits that leaves so many questions unanswered!The only good quality of this is when they Eat and that's all. Don't make a season 2!!!!"
Overlord Movie 3: Sei Oukoku-hen,"The Overlord The Sacred Kingdom film takes the light novel story between volumes 12 and 13. If placed in the time setting of the TV anime series, the story takes place in season 4, episodes 7-8, in this film the story will take place in the Arc Roble Holy Kingdom, we will see more focus on the new character Neia Baraja, one of the holy kingdom soldiers who is looking for the meaning of true justice.This film may be the only best film from the Overlord Anime franchise for nowHow could it not be, this film provides a duration of more than 2...hours of viewing experience with better visuals and sharper image coloring than the TV series version, the use of CG is also made smootherHowever, this film also still has shortcomings such as making some story cuts that can be felt directly by Light novel readers if this film has a fairly fast storytelling tempo and eliminates some details from the Light novel, maybe to adjust to the duration of the filmIn addition, at least there are also details of the story that occurs in the Light Novel that are still included in the film even though not muchTherefore, this film is still very worthy of watching, especially for fans of the Overlord franchiseJust a suggestion for viewers who have just watched this anime and are curious about the story of the film, it is better to watch the TV series version first which consists of 4 seasons with a total of 52 episodes before watching this film so that it is more connected and understands the storyline that will  be presented in the film."
Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 3rd Season,"Season 3: Drawn out narrative loses its appeal.Originally, Re:Zero had a really interesting concept behind it. MC stuck in an endless loop of death and time rewind, witnessing horrible events and trying his best to overcome them. However, Re:Zero has failed to build upon this concept further, instead of exploring new ideas to enrich the show, it has become repetition machine that simply re-iterates over extremely similar events over and over again with sole focus on increasing show length instead of building interesting story.Characters:Character growth is extremely small if non-existent for the most part. Despite suffering through endless tragedies, Subaru is still a crybaby. Characters...are uninteresting, it is as if they are auto-generated NPCs on an RPG game, writer has used exact same formula on all characters, they have one romantic interest they are obsessed with and flat personality dictated by one trait that with no depth. Villans are even more uninteresting because almost all of them are complete psycho's that are evil for sake of being evil. All of this makes show extremely predictable at season 3 and removes the tension that was present on early seasons.Bad dialogue:Dialogue lacks depth and nuance, every character acts like they are 12 years old with overly simple and exaggerated emotions and repetition of sentences over and over. Anytime more than 4 characters are having a conversation feels like circus with characters randomly interrupting each other and screaming out of nowhere. Conversations feel unnatural and hollow."
Suzume no Tojimari,"Suzume is a story about understanding trauma and finding meaning in life. Or that's what I took from it. Beautifully animated and with an amazing story, the 2-hour-long feature hopes to leave an impact on its viewers, but despite everything, the plot falls flat, and that is one of the most important parts of a story.The general premise of the story is that there are these doors or portals that lock away a 'worm monster' that is attempting to destroy Japan through natural disasters. It is not explained why this happens. Suzume manages to release one of two 'keystones' keeping this monster locked away...and is now tasked with closing the remaining doors and locking the worm monster away with the help of Souta, who comes from generations of door 'closers.' One of the biggest loose ends occurs here when the old keystone, which ends up being a cat (diety) called Daijin, turns Souta into a chair Suzume's mother gave her as a child. There is no explanation as to why this happens, which bothers me more than it should.The animation is beautiful, and many of the scenes are incredibly beautiful and could be used as still pictures with their vibrant colors. The storyboarding and cinematography are also phenomenal, with shots of the everyday life of people past (passed) being shown multiple times throughout the movie. These scenes are very impactful and are tastefully depicted with the viewer embodying the people in the past with our viewpoint coming from their perception (basically a first person pov.) The last fifteen minutes within the final door are also beautifully animated, and I can tell the animators spent a lot of time and care into these few moments in the movie.The music is wonderful to listen to. It's no surprise that RADWIMPS created amazing music, but the title track from this movie has to be my favorite of their anime OST's.Another problem this film had was pacing. And it reminded me a lot of Miyazaki's Boy and the Heron in that aspect. The pacing felt slow and then fast at different points in the movie, and it felt like there was so much content being fit into a 2-hour feature, which I think is the leading cause of the pacing issue. There were two main climaxes to the movie, and both 'hero's journey' outlines take an hour, yet somehow the first hour felt so much longer than the second, and this was because the rising action of the first half did not measure up to the rising action of the second half. If you don't pay close attention to the plot at all, you will still enjoy the film, but because the plot falls flat, the message does, too.It's important to note that this story deals with trauma and memory of natural disasters, specifically the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, in which Suzume lost her mother when she was four. This movie serves as a journey of growth in which Suzume begins to remember her repressed memories of when this all occurred and ends with her understanding the meaning of living and persevering through life because life is fleeting and because it's fleeting, it's beautiful. (I think because it ties to the cultural memory of this earthquake and tsunami, the movie may have been more impactful to Japanese audiences who still feel the effects of the recent memory of the tsunami and earthquakes on them.)However, my biggest issue with the movie was the unnecessary romance. Suzume goes out of her way to save Souta, not because they became friends throughout their journey, but because she has fallen in love with him. This I didn't find the strangest because a high school girl could totally start crushing on the older, good-looking guy she is working alongside to save the world. However, during almost all of their time spent together, Souta is a chair. It's literally a walking and talking chair. So the romance just doesn't make sense to me and seems... strange and out of the blue when Suzume suddenly professes her love for Souta to his grandfather as she begins her journey to save him literally halfway through the movie.Another loose end that is never cleared up is how Suzume was able to enter the door when she was four years old after her mother died. It's never cleared up despite being mentioned at the end of the movie.Long story short: I recommend this movie for the musical and animation experience. The plot and message fall a little flat, with a couple of loose ends, but it's a good movie to play on a night you're bored."
Raise wa Tanin ga Ii,"This is a serially underestimated anime - it's maximized everything it could do with a low budget, and is far more entertaining than it has any right to be. The main leads are an insane mix of badass and psychotic, and propel the story with the force of their strong personalities. This is also the most world building I've seen a romcom attempt, and there is more than one yakuza subplot stirring underneath - part of the fun is to peel back the onion layers, and figure out what is motivating whom. The VAs carry the show on the back of a solid dialogue script;...one can't predict what they'll say next, but the line delivery will make you laugh out loud. Songs are bangers, and the music design is no slouch; it is perfectly timed and well-composed. People turn away from this anime because it doens't look good - they're not wrong, the character designs are not appealing and there's nothing in the animation to admire, but like I said, this anime maximized everything it had at its disposal and added dynamic camera angles and creative character positioning to spice up what could easily have been static scenes. My score reflects this mammoth effort to make good with little means. It's kept my eyes glued so it's definitely doing something right."
Hanma Baki: Son of Ogre,"(This Review is created by somebody who watched this season out of order from the rest)If you like hitting the gym or Boxing, this anime is for you.This anime is about the son of an orge, Baki,  who goes to the Arizona State Prison to have a 1v1 with America's strongest man in order to prove himself worthy of fighting and to get stronger.The animation quality is good and the art is unique as it puts more emphasis on definition of the face and body on the charactersThe story for this season is made quite well, and it combines humor and fighting together...to showcase Baki's journey to defeat America's strongest man.Be aware, there is a lot of urinating randomly on people in the anime, and I still do not understand why it's in there.My only negative is that they make some of the fight scenes turn into a big yapfest with the side characters explaining what they see in the fight. It made me a lil bored and affected the pacing a bit, not its not that big of a deal.Overall i loved the story but the story at times can be a little weird, giving it a light 8."
Overlord Movie 3: Sei Oukoku-hen,"The Dark Fantasy Overlord Anime Series is back with one of the Movies that will definitely entertain its fans, with a movie duration of more than 2 hours taking the story in the Holy Kingdom Arc here we follow the journey of the new character Neia Baraja in search of the true meaning of justice.In this movie we will also be presented with better visuals than the series version, especially the sharper coloring, Madhouse studio seems to be trying their best to make this movie entertaining for fans of this animeand of course this movie is not perfect because Madhouse studio still uses CG...which will be quite surprising to the eyes of new viewers of this movie, and also the story cuts from the light novel which are quite noticeable which indicates that this movie has a fairly fast story tempo if you are a reader of the Light novel, but it seems that this can be justified because to adjust the story to the duration of the MovieOh and for those of you who are readers of the Light novel, don't worry, some of the iconic stories in the book are still prioritized in the movieRegardless of the advantages and  disadvantages of this movie, I still enjoy the entertainment provided by the studioNeia and Shizu's behavior in this movie too  very funny, one of the added value for the movie."
Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song,"5.75/10 ~ Great show to turn the brain off to watch Hatsune Miku with gunzIt is not surprise that this show is ""what if Miku but in the world of Terminator"". The show has great visuals and strangely enough even though the story claims its trying to be music show with idols and what not, it has surprisingly good fight scenes and quite decent fight choreography. The show also asks the question of what does it mean to be alive, what does it mean to be human, to have humanity and is ones purpose better or worse then someone else's'?The show doesnt do...quite a great job at any of those questions except life's purpose, I would argue that it actually asks that question pretty well.Now the show has pretty bad:- pacing- plot holes- very poor world building- next to no character development- story is not deep- post credit end scene ruins the ending (Imo)But hey, cute girls with gunz is why we are here, I kinda wish they made her look more like Miku lolAll that being said I did enjoy the show enough to watch it all the way through, I am not someone shy or strong enough to not throw bad shows away. I would say this is 100% skippable as 'Cute Girls with gunz' is slowly but surely turning into a trope, and the introspection of AI and what is actually humanity question was done best by many other media such as Ghost in the Shell, Ergo Proxy and so many others. I would say this show is about in line with Solo leveling season 1 if that means anything to you."
Honoo no Tenkousei,"This show is pretty awesome.Balls to the walls high testosterone action, paired with absolutely stunning animation from the late, great, Studio Gainax. Everything here is so fluid, each expression pushed to extremes. The big choppy outlines on the characters are great aesthetic touches. The action itself is nicely choreographed--nothing out of this world, by any means, but it's cheesy and perfect for the OVA's overall tone. You should watch this for the animation alone.The story is pretty bare-boned, all things considered, but the characters are all delightfully cheesy and delightfully charming. I wish Yukari had a little more agency in this, but you...get what you get with 90s OVAs.Overall, deeply enjoyable 90s action fun. Short, quick, great watch."
Blue Lock vs. U-20 Japan,"i literally told my girl to just read the manga after watching specifically episode 8, i have nothing but hate for this fucking studio. they made Sae feel like a clown instead of an actual monster of a player. I feel like the only time this shit show should be watched is episode 6 and 7, I may be wrong about episode 9+, but having 2/8 episodes the only ones worth watching is disappointing. I'm aware it's not the animators' fault but I genuinely hope the studio burns down to the ground and the owner of it dies a miserable death. I'm usually a positive...guy but they just ruined my top 1 manga of all timeIf you're watching this for the first time and want to keep watching the anime, stop at the end of episode 3 and watch this fan animation instead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ysp9lMN1QThen somewhere at the final episode, watch this instead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUy_bU3aTXs"
Hyouken no Majutsushi ga Sekai wo Suberu,"Great potential, but there's no excuse for the wasted time in earlier episodes for that rushed of an ending. If you made a mess in your pants after Game of Throne edged you for years, then let them punch you straight in the balls on the final episode, and can't wait to have that feeling again, by all means start this show.If my sarcasm wasn't apparent, then I'll plainly say it as well. I was teased into thinking that this show might actually go somewhere.The first episode felt like the intro to a visual novel game where you're forced to meet all the characters and...they have the ""first impression"" moment where they establish the characters cheaply and you can tell there won't be much if any character development.The best parts of the show were the opening, the visuals, the magic system being awesome and understandable, and an overpowered character that was forcefully limited by his wellbeing and not the strength of their enemies."
Ore dake Level Up na Ken: ReAwakening,"Honestly right of the bat: Only watch this movie if you want to see the beginning of S2 earlier. It recaps S1 (and skips a lot of it, obviously, but it is a nice refresher if you don't want to rewatch the whole season) and then shows the first 2 episodes of the second season.It isn't a bad movie per se but if you have the time then watching the full first season is just a better experience and once S2 drops I don't really see a reason to watch this movie other than to get a quick refresher as to what happened in the...first season.This review was written before it ""aired"" however we got the movie today - November 26 - here in Germany so I was already able to watch it in the cinema."
Made in Abyss,"If there is one word that describes my experience with made in abyss, that must be ""disappointment"".I have been reading for a long time and I had been told that the anime was great and that despite the childish artistic section it was a very adult anime.But after watching it, this anime definitely does not fulfill the first and even less the second.We are presented with an interesting world but the plot wastes it horribly being extremely simple, in most chapters practically nothing interesting happens or something that motivates you to continue watching the series, hardly anything remarkable happens in the last 3 chapters and...frankly the only one that offered something interesting was precisely the last one, so you will get an idea of ​​the pace that this series handles.The characters are flat, uninteresting and not memorable, Riko has the attitude of a typical shonen protagonist, Reg is not very different either, the other secondary characters are more of the same stereotypical and generic personalities in an average adventure anime, again the only halfway interesting character does not appear until the last episodes (nanachi), apart from that all the characters have the same level of writing and complexity as Chaoz from Dragon Ball (and not because he at least had a memorable moment in the Saiyan saga, the cast of Made in Abyss or even that).There is nothing adult about it, the only thing there is is a bit of badly done gore and quite unnecessary scenes of child nudity that make us notice the kind of tastes that its author has, the series has quite a cringe humor to the point that I wondered if this was really the ""modern masterpiece"" that I had read and heard so much about.Although not everything is bad, despite the world not being well used and its creatures being quite interesting and original, providing variety, episode 13 really seemed good to me, although it falls apart in the second half unfortunately, I suppose I could mention the good sound aspect which stands out quite a bit, the drawing is extremely beautiful in the backgrounds although the animation is quite average.In conclusion, overall I found it quite disappointing and extremely overrated for what it offers, but the technical aspects and some good ideas made it at least not a bad experience at all."
Rekishi ni Nokoru Akujo ni Naru zo,"Be forewarned, this anime is the kind of anime that is extremely surface level. All the characters are 1 dimensional with surface-level ""reasons"" and ""logic"" for their action and behavior. Even the adults, who are as deep and complex as a puddle on the sidewalk after  a rain shower.FL has the most moronic reason for ""acting like a villainess"" because she wants to be ""The Best Villainess"" in history. I get liking a character for their fortitude, resilience and cutting honesty but to simply act like a villainess simply for the sake to be a good one is THE stupidest crap I've ever...heard. I've watched some dumb animes, knowing full well how dumb they are but this takes the cake. I read the wiki on why the FL's world is not what it appears. Even then, every decision, plot twist, or action made by these characters lacks so much depth that a flat sheet of paper would be considered a swan origami by comparison."
Ao no Miburo,"For all the reasons the anime gets a bad rep are what also makes it enjoyable to watch. There are quite a lot of monologues and self declarations by the MC that come off cheesy and cliché but that’s also what makes him so endearing.You have our MC who is setting out for the first time and is tired and confused by all the violence and fear around him. He gets recruited to be a member of the local Shinsengumi faction and from there hopes to create a not so distant future where children are able to grow up free from oppression. It’s your typical...historical drama with attractive male characters who charm and cut shit up.Overall the anime is cliche and you’ve seen this done a million times but for some reason it works for this show. The characters are charismatic the MC is a child so it doesn’t come off pretentious when he monologues as it would in other shows.If you want something easy to watch with that historical feel then you shouldn’t have a problem with this. It’s not terrible it’s not amazing, it’s simple easy to understand.The music was great and the animations were gorgeous. You have nothing to lose by watch this anime, but you may just find yourself enjoying it more than you'd thought"
Kengan Ashura Season 2 Part 2,"I don't usually watch martial arts anime, but I ended up watching this one because of a scene on YouTube where Karura tries to flirt with Ohma and he runs away 😂.The story of the characters is quite interesting, each one with their own reasons and they show human complexity. Ohma simply wanted to show everyone that he was strong, a Goku of life, and besides that he has the desire to overcome himself even if he gets into critical conditions. He has his charisma when fighting and Yamashida outside the ring with all his insecurity that he has to overcome. The negative point is...that the Kure family was little explored in this final stretch and for me there is a small hole in the script where the Kure could have given some tip on how to better control the life advancement technique, which could... I won't give spoilers 😂.Another negative point, but this is my personal opinion, is that they could have worked on Ohma's relationship with Karura, and the animation is fantastic, even for a 3D"
Tokidoki Bosotto Russia-go de Dereru Tonari no Alya-san,"I realized very early on that I’m probably not the target demographic for this anime—it seems clearly aimed at p*rn-addicted self-inserts. Since I don’t consider myself part of that group, take my review with a grain of salt.I have very mixed feelings about this anime, so I’ll break them down into clear points:Art and Design:Easily the best part of the series. The character designs are beautiful, and the animation is consistently well-executed. I honestly can’t ask for much more in this department—it’s top-notch.Characters:There’s plenty of variety among the characters, but many feel like they exist solely to attract as wide an audience as possible. The...main character is a pitiful attempt at a relatable self-insert—Oh, he’s actually a reliable guy just pretending to be lazy? That feels like a shallow ploy to make romantically frustrated men think, “Oh, he’s just like me!”Yuki, in particular, left me baffled. What was her end goal? Did she want to surpass her brother? Did she wish for her brother to be happy with Alya? Or—disturbingly—was she trying to seduce her own brother? Incest is not okay, and it’s easily the most disgusting aspect of this anime. I genuinely worry about the people who enjoy such a trope in a show. Do better.Plot:The plotline isn’t particularly groundbreaking. The student council setting ensures that at least something is always happening, but it doesn’t reach very deep. The way the student council is treated with such gravity feels a bit over-the-top, though this might be due to cultural differences and it's definitely not exclusive to only this anime, so I won't take points away for that.Given that this is supposed to be a romcom, I personally would’ve liked to see more emphasis on the romance. The comedy element works occasionally, but it often feels cheap and doesn’t leave much of an impact in the grand scheme of things.Fan Service:I understand that fan service makes money, but I don’t understand the appeal of mixing it into an anime. If I’m bored, I’ll watch an entertaining show full of drama. If I want to see women in underwear, I’ll watch an entirely different type of video. Combining the two feels unnecessary and detracts from the overall experience.Furthermore, this series takes fan service to uncomfortable extremes. What did the hypnosis scene add to the plot? Nothing! It just made all of the unga-bungas drool because “haha boobie.” This kind of content is exactly why I feel like I’m likely not the target demographic.Summary:Despite its many negatives, I can’t say I didn’t enjoy the show at least a little. It does have its charm, I suppose. I’ll stick around for the second season in the hope that some of these issues are addressed. The potential is clearly there.5/10 – Average"
Synduality: Noir,"This is your generic and cliché trope where the MC will always try to do something for the sake of justice/good but he doesn't have the required strength to do so. His actions related heavily to his feelings, he went straight thru a dangerous situation and always ended up saved by random pedestrians. He's so gullible that you can practically sell him to a slave master, he'd straight up believe that you're giving him a harsh training and he'll overcome it eventually, sigh.Kanata as the main character had little to none character development on this first season. He shouts at people when he doesn't understand...anything that is going on, he closes his eyes like a kid when he is in danger, he doesn't want to be treated as a kid yet he gives his robot the same treatment. Talk about irony eh?The only thing I've found entertaining is the 'Team Rocket' characters for this series, Range and Dolce. Both of them are made for each other to be honest. They act goofy, they clown everybody and their chemistry is perfect, it doesn't feel forced. On the other hand, the MC and his 'hardships' felt like the writer is involved on the story but gave no development to him. He was influenced by the decisions of the people around him, he seldomly makes decision to do something BY HIMSELF except performing machines' repair and maintenance. It's like watching a zombie, taking orders from everyone and when he's not, he's back to doing zombie stuff.What I meant by ""the writer is involved"" is, the people around the MC always initiate something to make the MC do stuff. He was 'spoon-fed' so hard, that some characters had to find a way for him to fight important figures or bosses even though he had no strength to do so. But, it's not a problem, plot armour prevails for this trope.But, I'll have to give credits where its due, props to 8bit studio for the excellent CGI and animations."
Chi's Sweet Home,"It was so bittersweet to see this series come to an end. Where will I go for my daily cuteness overdose now???It's a kids show, so the artwork is very cartoony. And the animation certainly leaves a lot to be desired. But the episodes, minus the opening, are only 2 minutes long. It's great if you only have a moment. Or you can binge 10-12 episodes in a row easily enough.The narrative writing is simplistic enough for even a preschooler to follow. Episodic, to some short arcs before things get resolved. But the thing that really impressed me was the wide array of characters,...and how well written they all were. Chi's extended family is totally lovable, one and all.I liked the VA work. It fit both pets and humans well. The director did a good job of portraying a number of different emotional responses to situations, while keeping the main premise of cute intact, A lot of times I don't mention soundtracks, but this opening really grew on me over time. I watched every opening sequence for all 104 episodes, and caught myself chair dancing, too many times. I am also glad they translated the lyrics, in the sub, for the final episode. Made the song even more enjoyable.If you have little bits running about, and want to share your passion for anime with them, this is the place to start. It's not perfect, but I found it highly enjoyable. If I were to grade Chi on her performance, I'd say a solid B at 86/100 would hit the mark nicely. No pussyfooting around it. This series is as adorable as it gets."
FLCL,"FLCL was a literally a masterpiece, it was so unique, so goofy, so brainrot, I loved it. Animation and soundtracks are the best thing this anime has to offer, the songs perfectly matched the vibe of the show. There are so many Japanese references which are like so hard to catch (for me) and you can notice that Gainax team really did a great job with those Manga panels sequences. Every episode was so fast paced and chaotic which made this 6 ep anime look better than some of the other 24 ep animes out there (Better than NGE). I don't think I will see...an anime like this ever again.Haruko carried this whole anime W character."
Genshiken Nidaime,"What a really cute series, continuing the strong romance subplots from the first 2 seasons and introducing some really great new characters. The switch from a space dominated by young men to one dominated by young women and fujoshi in particular was really smart and fun in my opinion and allows growth for all characters old and new, it's great to have the originals revisited as they move on from college and in particular from their day to day life at the club.If you were totally in love with the old characters maybe they won't really be revisited enough outside of Madarame and Ohno but...i really found that the attention they were given was fitting as many of them were finishing their University Life Arc and starting to move in ways Madarame and Ohno weren't (for various reasons).I'd have loved to see a more emphatic romantic end to Hato and Madarame's story, they have some extremely cute moments together through the series and how much they care about each other is obvious but i guess the world was not ready for it yet. Hato is a wonderful addition and great character, very easy to read as trans and a real sweetheart.Genshiken's first two seasons are very fun slice of life with some nice romantic subplots and this series really is a great step up from an already solid base!"
Vegeta Super Yasaijin ni Narou-hen,"The review I wanted to submit was too short for MAL so I had to expand it longer than the duration of this commercial. Copying and pasting the template questions to answer everything MAL considers required for a review.Is the story unique?

Did they have flaws and strengths, or were they unusually strong/smart/stupid?...If cup noodles were a character, they'd be 10/10Did the characters react to situations and events in a realistic way?Maybe, I didn't think too hard about itDo you think others will enjoy/dislike this series, even if you didn't?

Boku no Hero Academia 7th Season,"HOnestly, I think therei s too much back and forsth, and ""5 minutes  earlier""  and what not. It feel really dragged out.It's a given that there will be fights, but hte way that you jump between the fights are just... Dragged out.Of course they are interesting and what not, but I mean, You show us Midoriya's fight and then OH WAIT! It's importnat to see all theo thers fight too. HECK NO I AM NOT INTERESTED, YOU SPEND like... 5 EPISODES On dragging out hte MINUTES. And then You see around 1-2 episodes of Midoriya screen time then ON to the next...thing, you didnt even bother FINISHING the FREAKING FIGHT!? COMON MAN.I am not amused with this."
Yamada-kun to Lv999 no Koi wo Suru,"Pretty anticlimactic despite the slow burn nature of the show. Somehow a side character's rejection scene is a lot more emotional and impactful than the main confession scene at the end.Not all slow burns are equal, but this one is pretty okay. The first few episodes are a bit too slow but it can get away with it, after that it's a nice journey. What really drags this show down is the ending, the confession is just not it, a rejection scene that happens just a bit before compeltely outshines it. The buildup alone was enough to expect a better climax, the rejection scene being...as good and emotional as it was just added fuel to the fire, making it even worse in contrast.Yamada's cold, attractive, oblivious character is way overdone, other than that the 2 MCs are enjoyable. The purpose of the side character felt unclear, some were given an entire episode and a background story randomly, but barely any character development despite all the screentime spent on them. It's in a weird middle ground where the side characters were not given enough screentime to make much impact on the show, but given way more than necessary for their contribution to the story. Maybe it's just an adaptation issue.With the ending being as half assed as it is, a second season is needed, but who knows if we'll ever get it. Either way, if you prefer the journey over the destination, go for it, otherwise expect to get disappointed a bit."
Hatsukoi Limited.,"Hatsukoi Limited starts off with a showcase of gross fan service given the characters ages & a weird age gap sequence. The spotlight for the first episode is on (in my opinion) the worst girl in the main cast which could turn off some folks or keep them around. That being said it also has a strong introduction to the main characters and their dynamics,, also given the age of the characters and the shows focus on first love, a lot of the characters behave realistic but a few are questionable.I found that it starts to fall off or become noticeably repetitive around episode 3/4...with love triangle drama, brocon/siscon connections and lack of focus on a few characters who later get one shot episodes that come out of nowhere linking to the intertwined romances.Overall what kept me invested until the end was the growth and connection between Enomoto & Kusuda who surprising myself, were two characters I did not enjoy during the initial episodes but they became the only two characters I cared about & found enjoyable by the end simply because other characters felt like they stagnated, were forgotten or just awful people."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"Magic. Fantasy. Alternative reality.Those are the genres I avoid as the few I've watched let me down significantly so I was skeptical at first but am glad I gave it a chance.The protagonist is simple in his views but he isn't a simpleton who take orders yet likable as he is passionate about his belief and will try to fulfil it to the very end.Fuji, was opposite. He is the one who you can rely on in times but can seem cold-hearted due to the way he interacts with others even though that isn't the case.The female for me was too much. Her fighting...was phenomenon but her personality of thinking she is better then everyone else.It was great to watch and definitely kept me entertained but it definitely isn't a rewatch. No key moments that will keep relaying on my mind."
ReLIFE: Kanketsu-hen,"Wednesday November 26 2024 - Wednesday November 26 2024Studios: TMS EntertainmentSource: Web mangaGenres: Drama, RomanceTheme: SchoolBeing an adult, have you ever thought about it when you were a kid wanting to be an adult?, it feels like it's free, no one forbids the things we do, can make our own money, make daily needs or even the items we want but is it true that being an adult is as beautiful as your wishful thinking when you were a child.This ReLife anime gives an idea of the real adult life, it's not as fun as you think when you were a child, moreover I...learned many things starting from appreciating time, trying hard to achieve something, being grateful, enjoying the phase of life that we are currently living, the point is to live our current life as well as possible, in this world there is no such thing as repeating life to adolescence again, at least when I made a review of this anime, so live your life as best you can, enjoy every precious moment, because it won't happen again.If I want to pour out all my personal opinions, I don't know how many notes I spent, the concept is very very unique, but the delivery is not rushed like a normal conversation and adorable like people in general, making me feel comfortable and can learn many things from this anime.There is someone who once expressed his opinion to me ""ris watching anime is what's the purpose"", maybe it can be answered simply like that but, but I instead answered, if asked if there is a point or not I also can't answer, but certainly if it weren't for anime I wouldn't be in this moment with you or not, anime has changed my life, has a lot of meaning that can be taken, sounds hyperbole but that's what I feel, and I will love anime, whenever it is, of course with a reasonable dose, such as the moral message of this anime according to my conclusion."
Overtake!,"Really enjoyed the similarities between two characters and Niki Lauda and James Hunt. The writer recreated their rivalry and the respect they had for eachother really well. The main character being outside of the sport is a great way to introduce viewers to the sport without bombarding them with information.The characters don't feel shallow, though the main action revolves mainly around a few certain places it never feels boring or repeated. Every episode manages to deliver a nice experience for the viewer.The anime is not perfect. There are many small issues like plot holes, exaggerations or various plot devices that make no sense.Great watch...even if you are not into any sort of motorsports."
Amagami-san Chi no Enmusubi,"The show starts off all fanservice and no substance. You have seem this formula a billion times already. Last year it was the Cafe Terrace show, now it's Tying the Knot With an Amagami Sister (from now on called Knot). It follows the usual formula of ""guy who is kind of cold gets surrounded by girls and eventually has to choose a love interest. But don't worry deep inside he is kind but just puts up a front. Also he always accidentally gropes them or sees them naked."" Completely typical.Knot's issue is that it wants to have it both ways. It wants to give you...mind-numbing fan service with really shallow character tropes, but for some reason it also wants to tell a serious story. The serious story, however, is completely uninteresting. So it's just overt fanservice interrupted by long stretches of really boring storytelling. Even if you're watching this because you're a gooner, your fanservice will be ruined by shitty storytelling that seems to last forever."
"Isekai de Cheat Skill wo Te ni Shita Ore wa, Genjitsu Sekai wo mo Musou Suru: Level Up wa Jinsei wo Kaeta","I understand the whole entire cheat skill idea behind this anime, but everything the MC does feels empty. We're just supposed to believe the hardships he went through and how he feels. We're supposed to believe he deserves these new powers except it doesn't feel earned. Every single interaction between Yuuya and any character ends up with him being praised as the cool good looking guy that's good at everything. Every single episode he faces a corny task that makes him look good. He never struggles with anything besides the surface level.Speaking of surface level. The world building in this anime is atrocious. Where...the fuck is the MC spawning? All the isekai action takes place in a forest, a castle and a mansion. The real world itself is just as guilty as the action takes place in 5 spots max.Yuuya as a character is the definition of bland. He has literally no personality other than the fact he is nice. He has no redeeming qualities other than ""I like helping people"" and no defects other than the ""I was fat and ugly"". He has no character development at all. All of the side characters are literally useless compared to him, they are not even characters, they are either plot devices to make Yuuya look badass or blatant fanservice. Literally nobody has a personality other than one or two characters that are the archetype ""Gamer Nerd"" or ""Football Jock"".This anime is not for people who want a story. There is no story."
"Saikyou no Shienshoku ""Wajutsushi"" de Aru Ore wa Sekai Saikyou Clan wo Shitagaeru","I deleted my previous review because based on the first 2-3 episodes, the show was irredeemable and I gave it a score of 1. I am upping the score after watching more, but I still don't see what's special. The quality is pretty much on par with the average isekai.The first two episodes were downright atrocious. Noel was such an unlikeable, edgy, abrasive prick. He constantly picked fights with his party mates and slung insults at them unprovoked. Two of them seemed okay with it, which is strange. One of his party members doesn't take the insults and throws them back at Noel, which is...completely understandable. However, Noel apparently could not take his own behavior directed at him. Just like a manchild or a mentally deranged person, his response to getting what he deserves is to try and escalate this into a fight.My favorite example is when a person tells Noel he dropped a coin. Just like a normal person would, Noel tells him that he doesn't want to touch coins that came into contact with his filthy disgusting hands. When that person asks Noel for an apology, Noel kicks him in the face. It seems the Most Notorious Talker can't talk like a normal human being.Thankfully, he isn't like this for the entire show. After the first two episodes, it turns out Noel will only sometimes act like a manchild. He suddenly becomes capable of normal human conversation (for anime standards, at least). However, Noel remains really edgy. Ideally, this would be good grounds for the other characters to make fun of Noel, just like in real life. But sadly, the characters' personalities all exist in a vacuum.Many people cite Noel's harsh punishments as to why they enjoyed this. This sentiment doesn't make much sense. For starters, if I wanted to see cruel revenge plots, I would watch Redo of Healer. Also, The Most Notorious Talker isn't good at setting up these revenge subplots. A lot of them involve moustache twirling cartoonishly evil villains that you met a few episodes ago and don't have much connection to. This is different from a long plot exacted on an antagonist who has been established prior, such as Kurapika vs The Phantom Troupe in Hunter x Hunter.Another reason why it falls flat is because it's not really impressive to write these revenge plots the way The Most Notorious Talker does. It's like if I wrote ""A thief stole Noel's purse and Noel r**ed his family then pulled their guts out and ate them."" There, I made a way edgier punishment. But it's not really impressive because I can just make up whatever I want. At least Redo of Healer spent episodes setting up the MC's motives and backstory before diving into the sadistic revenge. In the Most Notorious Talker, it just kinda happens for no reason.The dialogue is pretty average if you have watched other isekai. Outside of anything plot related, the characters just have very obvious and predictable conversations. In fact, all the interactions outside of the plot follow very predictable tropes that were seen over and over.However, for all my criticisms, I do not think the show is horrible and it was okay to passively watch while I procrastinate. It's okay, just not anything great. I would say judge it based on the first 3 episodes. The first two are too atrocious to base your opinion on them."
Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru,"____NO SPOILERS, FEEL FREE TO READ, CAN BE OFFENSIVEMy dress-up darling its the definition of ""the peace that ruined by fanservice"", but between pantsushots and awkward moments you can find a sense that author tries to convey.This anime tries to show real passion via beautiful aspects and animaton, camera placement in last episode is fantastic.Author tries to say that real passion and love to what you do is the most important thing in the world. MC who is perfectionist tries to find inspiration to improve his art, starts making costumes to Marin (girl MC) and...she, in her turn, shows passion to cosplay. Passion - its the lever or switch or wire, as you wish, that connected them, and passion to each other created love between them. Thats it, thats the whole point of anime.Ok as conclusion i should say: if you wanna look at beautiful scenes (25%) and fap on fanservice (75%) so, go on)) and this is very annoying! no improvement in MCs relationships, no intrigue or even really interesting moments. Sadly, but i kinda watched 12 same episodes and saw that nothing changed. But there is a lot animes which doesn't have even this level of sense + you still can recommend it to pubertate teens)"
SSSS.Dynazenon,"For a 12 episode show, it does what it needs to do well enough. Unlike it’s predecessor, we have an actual cast this time around. The drama doesn’t feel overly forced and the characters aren’t extremely one-dimensional. They have inner conflicts and struggles that they have to work on throughout the 12 episodes, and learn from them and grow and become better people.The main focus of all of these is probably Yume, the deuteragonist, who has a decent backstory and her own personal issues she works on, while being helped with the friends she makes through the dynazenon and mecha/kaiju stuff. Unfortunately, most of the...other characters personal struggles and backstories overshadow the MC’s which felt kind of forgotten, as it seemed it was going to have more attention paid to it. Though he acts as more of a support character and has his fair share of moments throughout the season.Again, studio trigger did animate this, which leads to the cinematography/directing being great as usual, and the character designs this time are actually great, all of them look unique and cool in their own ways. The dialogue is also good, as usual. They sound like normal humans, not scripted animated characters.The fights are still filled with dumb mecha/kaiju tropes and corny lines, but with a bit more self-awareness of the fact. The show peaked around episode 10 - 11, with the finale feeling squeezed in and ruining potential plot lines with a pretty unsatisfactory boring ending, which anyone could expect from the start.ssss.dynazenon is an average mecha anime with a well rounded entertaining cast, and big dumb fights with kaijus. You could finish it in a night or 2, and be satisfied with it."
SSSS.Gridman,"SSSS.Gridman is an extremely boring, average series to a fault. It has nothing special about it, with the MC being an amnesiac character with pretty much an empty personality, nonsensical plot that realistically doesn’t even make sense in their own world, a boring villain that is just there to be driving the plot, and pretty much no lore or explanation of the world they are in.The only redeemable factors are the cinematography/directing, as it is from studio Trigger, and the dialogue. The characters might be one-dimensional with little to no inner conflict, and empty personalities, but the dialogue isn’t half bad, and the voice acting...is pretty good.The fights themselves are extremely corny and don’t make any sense, as expected from any kaiju/mecha anime, but they aren’t too boring most of the time. It’s only 12 episodes so it’s not really a drag to watch the whole thing quickly, but you’re better off without it. It hasn’t been 24 hours since I finished it but i already forgot the characters names.boring show, nothing special going for it. In my humble opinion, you’re better off skipping this one."
Kanokon Specials,"If you enjoyed the fanservice of Kanokon The Girl Who Cried Fox, and just wanted to see more of that then this is for you.No plot. Just 12 episodes of 2 minute shorts of girls posing nude and doing lewd things.The main series was never that deep plot-wise anyway. And this special really shows what the main theme was all about anyway: lewdness.There are some pretty good desktop-background or screensaver worthy shots in here too.It features all the main female characters from the show. They all get their spotlight.This special is this close 🤏 to going from ecchi to full on hentai."
Dekisokonai to Yobareta Motoeiyuu wa Jikka kara Tsuihou sareta node Sukikatte ni Ikiru Koto ni Shita,"If I were to sum this anime up in a word, it'd be *BLAND*. I personally gave it a 4. It's not god-awful, but it is pretty bad in terms of story. Even I failed to see any major development, which, one could argue, is the same with other isekai. However, the MCs of other isekai simply do it better by having traits that set them apart:- Slime Body- Skeleton Paladin- Skeleton Overlord- Loli Soldier- Fucking Vending Machine- Kazuma- A SwordThis guy is just a former hero who came out of retirement after promising to retire. He's an uncool Miyazaki. While his morals are in...the right place and his execution is flawless, it works like a charm, but it lacks flair. It's boring.To sum this review up, this was boring as hell, and I wouldn't recommend it if you're planning to watch something."
Chika Gentou Gekiga: Shoujo Tsubaki,"So, I got a recommendation for Shoujo Tsubaki from a friend after we talked about Perfect Blue. The only thing she told me was that it was super messed up. And it is. So much so that it took around 9 pirate sites for me to find the damn movie. I thank whoever made this that it's only 50 minutes because I don't think I could really feel good after watching it for more than an hour. I mean, with the main themes being betrayal, exploitation, abuse, and human depravity certainly makes it an uncomfortable watch.But here's the thing, it is a horror, but it's...not that horrifying. What I mean is that while the movie is grotesque, vivid, brutal and disturbing, that's it. So if you get horrified by pure imagery then you'll have a tough time. However, I'm not trying to say that the imagery isn't horrid. Due to it being hand drawn, it seems more gritty and raw. It also doesn't help that the film uses garish (overly bright) colours to heighten the sense of horror.To be honest, the movie would be a solid 7 or 8 out of 10 if the narrative was better. How? Well for starters, there was no character development whatsoever leading to me just feeling like crap throughout the entire movie. I think the story focuses too much on the grotesque side of things without actually giving two shits about the characters. The lines in the movie weren't character developing lines and most of the time it felt amateurish with the lines being spoken. And every time there should have been some sort of meaningful moment that could potentially develop a character, it gets overshadowed by another disgusting scene.Overall, the movie isn't that good and I don't really recommend it unless you're looking for senseless horror. I also don't really recommend since its kind of hard to find."
Hananoi-kun to Koi no Yamai,"The premise sounded cute on the surface, but A Condition Called Love is utterly forgettable in the face of dozens of other stories. Also, Hananoi needs therapy, not a girlfriend.I went into this knowing that he was a problematic lead male who pushes himself at the girl, and kind of hoped that the story would take the time to have him grow past this. It doesn't. The only change is Hinase growing to love him. That's not healthy. Relationships work when people grow and change together, not when one does all the adapting while the other just stagnates.Beyond the growing toxic relationship, everything else...was completely bland. The supporting cast has the potential to develop into their own interesting people but they don't. The traumatic backstory of Hinase and why she's afraid to fall in love is very surface level (and feels more like something that should impact her ability to make friends as opposed to falling in love. Girl is could be coded Aromantic and it would be better than giving her a trauma). Hananoi's trauma seems more plausible at least.....Honestly, I don't care much for this one, and am kind of disappointed in it, but it's not the worst one I've seen. If you like simple, bland, cute romance its for you."
Hyouken no Majutsushi ga Sekai wo Suberu,"I keep it short and simple, as I am sick.Don`t really understand the hate for the anime. It is mediocre and just a bit bland, but there is not much to make people hate it.The story and mc are decent (but nothing innovative), but the execution is lacking. Relationships develop fast, so it feels rushed, but somehow the makers still put a bit too many common cliches inside. For a non-harem anime it feels a bit too ""haremy"", but at least there is some logic behind it.It is a simple and somewhat entertaining anime that you can watch with your brain turned off."
Natsume Yuujinchou Shichi,"Wrapped up in lush, verdant fields and the nostalgic warmth of the countryside, Natsume Yuujinchou returns with its heartwarming sentimentality that we've all grown to love.Season 7 continues to be a wistful and heartfelt musing on compassion and connections. An episodic compendium of warmth that takes its audience on a snug, mystical, and down to earth trip. This season somehow manages to concentrate and refine all of the series' best parts. And for that reason, I am very confident to say that this is Natsuyuu's best season to date.The audiovisual remains as great as ever. As Natsume's daily life is adorned with simple, yet beautifully...picturesque backdrops, soothing, mystical, and tranquil music would ensue. Simple, yet remains very effective and beautful. The artwork and music go hand in hand to perfectly depict the unique and special mood this series has. An ethereal and nostalgic feel that perfectly complements the stories it wants to tell.Stories of supernatural are dime a dozen, so what makes Natsuyuu so special? I'd like to say that this show's truly unique and special atmosphere is a big reason. An atmosphere that permeates and haunts the very same stories that drives the show. Feelings of regret, nostalgia, poignancy, and tranquility all intertwine and feed off of each other to beautifully depict the stories, feelings, and messages the show wants to convey. Stories that seem simple on the surface take on a whole different vibe and meaning when coated with the show's unique feel. Stories that aim to tell widely different tales that tell widely different life messages. Natsuyuu's thoughtfulness combined with its unique atmosphere is what truly elevates it.I'd also like to praise its eagerness to be relatable to anyone who tries to engage with it. It has a little bit of everything for everyone, while staying consistent to its overarching premise. Different tales and messages all beautifully conveyed through the lens of a troubled and ever so relatable young man. Natsume is not only the perfect vehicle that moves this show forward, he also serves as a mirror to the audience. Initially, it's shown that Natsume is a very lonely person. To him, it's as if he's the only person in the world, burdened with having to see and entangle with the supernatural. We then see how he handles that loneliness and change as a person throughout the series. And while Natsume's journey doesn't stop here, this season truly feels like the culmination of all the things he's unknowingly achieved and done for himself throughout the seasons. Natsume's journey of self discovery compels us to contemplate and reflect on our own journey in life. From being a lonely, depressive person, to eventually having a group of people that love and cherish you for who you are. From being so deeply hurt and untrusting, to eventually having the heart to confide in others with your issues, and even your life. For those who share the same feelings of loneliness, this series wants you to know that it does get better. You might not think so, and Natsume didn't either,But it will get better. it should. you'll grieve, you'll feel empty, and it won't be easy, but the sun will rise for you too. and life will continue. and it will.Mellow, tranquil, and heartfelt, Natsume Yuujinchou remains as one of the best of its kind, A slice of life and iyashikei masterpiece with a lot of stories to tell, and a lot more heart to give."
Seirei Tsukai,"After coming to appreciate Silent Mobius, I rummaged through AIC's other OVA and movie credits, and this short, action-packed OVA is one that I've had my eye on for a while, though the art is much more muddy and dated but not without a degree of charm. Your average wimpy main turns out to be the ""chosen one."" He has sad sack syndrome and survivor's guilt from being a rejected siscon whom everyone hates due to a melodramatic string of deaths that he's loosely associated with and for being an adopted bastard. Everyone, that is, except his little cutie moeblob who is trying to pull...up his big boy pants for him, of course.A bunch of elemental clans—the individual members being called ELEMENTALORS! SUPER COOOOOOOOL!!!—crossover into the boring human world to wreck the place and engage in stylish and creative fight sequences because... that's just what they do. Gotta keep the balance or some other vague fantasy cliche something something or other, you know?Speaking of balance: there isn't time for any natural development of anything, at only 48 minutes, so it remains a sketch of a formulaic shonen, complete with abysmal storytelling and shallow characters. At least it's not too much of a slog and thankfully has a few sequences of enjoyable animation and fight scenes. There are directorial touches that make it watchable enough, but one would probably be better off viewing the best scenes on Sakugabooru. The pacing is too fast, but if you were to expand this series, the aesthetic would suffer, and it would probably be too slow and boring. The eternal catch-22 of shonen and vintage OVAs.Finally, the ending is garbage. MC just has the most absurd amount of power without even trying and corrects everything in what amounts to the blandest kind of I BELIEVE IN MYSELF ending, which comes right after the cucked line to his moeblob about how he can endure as long as she's alive. If you weren't the chosen one, she'd dump you in less than a week."
Higashi no Eden Movie I: The King of Eden,"Despite not innovating on what came before, Eden of The East the Movie I: The King of Eden managed to follow up the previous entry to an acceptable degree. In exchange for less risk, the plot followed a safe but uninspired narrative, opting to set up for the next iteration. Moreover, the decision to wrap the series up with films did reduce the amount of runtime available and led to an increased amount of exposition. However, there were some genuinely pleasant scenes, character chemistry, and progression in spite of those minor issues. This is a fine watch as long as your expectations are in check."
Senki Zesshou Symphogear XV,"This review covers my thoughts on all 5 seasons.Wow,This show saved me. It helped me realize the feelings within my heart. its not the most well written, or well animated, or anything in particular, but from start to finish, the passion of the story being told, and the true hopefulness of the message it has is like a blinding light. ""A light the gods don't know"" is such a fitting statement. I haven't felt this burning felling in my heart since watching Gurren laggan as a kid, but who know i would need that feeling to get over one of the most mentally challenging...moments of my life. I've lost 30 pounds in the first 3 months of finishing this show, i just put a spotify playlist of the anime's songs on repeat and reach for the sky. This show is everything i've wanted from a piece of media; Show, game, or otherwise. I made a promise to my self to never give up on my happiness, and with the song in my heart blaring, i plan to keep it.Thank you Symphogear. Thank you."
Chi. Chikyuu no Undou ni Tsuite,"Love this anime,Currently most isekais are so boring and repetitive,The story is unique,and intresting.Its a good blend of history and philosophy, though it has lesser part of science. The author has put much effort into building characters and plot.Art style is fine, The constellations they showed are accurate.Characters are well written, shows us that different researchers have different personalities and goals.Some want to help humanity, some want to get fame, some want to find beauty.struggles faced by people in older times, their sacrifices..If person is interested in history or astronomy, its a good watch."
Akuyaku Reijou Level 99: Watashi wa Ura-Boss desu ga Maou dewa Arimasen,"Started off good, all my favorite tropes, misunderstood villainess is a game where they’re trying to fix the plot and then they redeem themselves etc etc… but then got boring. Pretty shallow level writing, not much character developmentIt’s a very cliche trope (which I like) but I didn’t really get attached to any of the characters. Even the lead kinda bored me. Art was fine , but what was the point.If you want a casual kind of filler show, this would be good, but if ur looking for something exciting, try something elseHow much do I need to write jeez"
Chobits,"The story is plain and boring. In any case, I wouldn't enjoy it. The art style is fine. The characters were plain and had bad and cliche behavior. I only liked the opening. I hated the fetish in here. The story sometimes makes no sense or is ridiculous, and that pissed me off. Initially, I thought I was about to watch a mature anime, but it disappointed me. I hated Chii being so dumb throughout all the anime, hadn't she learned a thing? She is a machine! They would have saved themselves a lot of trouble if they had acted just a little bit. This...anime is mostly liked because it is old school, but that doesn’t make it any good."
Vinland Saga,"First, it's a shame that many important characters in the story die, especially innocent people, maybe that's what happened in the past history of our world, but I still can't accept it.That's why I give a score of 5/10 for this sadistic anime. Maybe I would give 8/10 if no important characters died in this anime, especially NPC/civilian characters... for the invaders, they deserved to die sadistically for what they did to the people they hurt and slaughtered.For the MC in this anime, I'm a little confused to judge it, he looks like Eren in the AOT anime, but with a little stupidity that makes...many people suffer. Especially in the second season, he actually became a farmer, and spent the story hoeing the land, not interesting at all until the end of the story.I hope the third season or the next one won't disappoint me, I hope the MC will be smarter and more badass... be True Warrior..."
Himegoto,"I love everything about this show, and I am not even into crossdressing to begin with.To understand why, take a look at the state of the entertainment industry around yourself and everything in general these days. What do you see? Oversanitized crap made to be as devoid of character and ""safe to consume"" as possible in order the reach the widest audience possible the greedy corporations behind said entertainment think will make them the biggest monetary gains for them. We live in an age an day where everything has to be as flat, bland and ""correct"" enough for the general public to consider it ""morally...acceptable"" and for the corporations to deem it ""financially viable"".Now, take all of that into account, and the fact that Himegoto is essentially a big fat middle finger to everything that I listed previously. Were those shows are ""righteous"", devoid of personality, and tailored to be a product to be consumed to the general audiences more than anything, Himegoto is antithesis of all of that. This show is vulgar, raunchy, bad taste and explicitly fetishistic on its premise, and that's what makes it great. It is a direct attack on everything ""upstanding"" on our society, and I couldn't love it more for it.It's a great comedy that pretty much breaks every taboo one could think of when it comes to the way men and women traditionally dress in society. Nothing it what it seems, you will get one or two big surprises the more you advance into this series, I guarantee you that. But be aware, the fact that I liked it so much for its direct attack on modern moralistic themes doesn't mean everyone else will do. As I mention previously, this show is explicitly fetishistic, and if you don't feel comfortable with crossdressing themes, sexual jokes repeated all through the series, or simply  believe the whole ""people's bulge getting flashed on screen at least two times every episode"" gig gets tiring real soon then this anime might just not be for you.Give it a try otherwise, enjoyed it. even tough I am as far from the world of crossdressing as one could be."
Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai? Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen OVA,"It was completely fine.  Pratically just a normal episode of Kaguya-sama except for the fact that the first section (and kinda the second section, though, it's not as egregious) has eechi.I don't mind fan-service, but that first segment was a little much 😭. I really, really, REALLY did not need to see Kaguya and Chika in that...position together. It wasn't really all that funny either. Like, I was laughing, but that was just due to how excessive the fan-service was. And it's kinda bad when your COMEDY anime isn't funny, but whatever, the rest of the OVA makes up for it, so it's...fine.The rest, as stated before, was just a normal Kaguya-sama episode. The section where Ishigama and Shirogane were reading hentai was really funny, along with the rice making one. If you liked Kaguya-sama and don't mind fan-service, then I recommend this. Otherwise, if you don't like fan-service, then it's really not required to watch it, this OVA literally doesn't add anything to the main romance or really any of the other relationships in the Student Council. It's just a fun little side-episode for the anime. If you don't watch it, your understanding of the anime won't change at all."
Urara Meirochou,"Urara Meirochou is what one would call an ""underrated"" show. Sure, it might not be anything revolutionary, ground breaking, or too out there for what the industry has to offer, but it does not need to be. The people who might bring these points up when watching this anime are losing the point on what Urara Meirochou tries to be to begin with: a cute light-hearted show about cute girls doing cute things on their daily life. And what for it is worth, it delivers on its promises.With a memorable cast of characters, an eye-watering color palette, relaxing traditional setting and pretty funny and wholesome...yuri and fan-service moments Urara Meirochou does right almost everything it proposes itself to do. The story, in my eyes, is also remarkable given the tipe of anime this actually is. It has some pretty interesting moments that leave you wondering about the world this anime takes places and what might happen beyond the short 12 episodes of this series.  It is one if not the only anime that has left me interested in the manga it is adapted from actually (don't be surprised if one day you see the Urara Meirochou manga added to my list, lol). That, to speak of the quality of its plot overall.To close it up; Urara Meirochou is an anime you watch if you wish to put your mind at easy, laugh a couple of times, and don't think too hard on what you are seeing. It would get a perfect score for me should it not for its intro, which I feel can be a bit chaotic at times and believe the producers could have done better."
Love Live! Superstar!! 3rd Season,"What, no one's reviewed this yet?  Well, let me be the first!  I guess...  it' a preliminary review but I do actually have a bit to say.This review will assume you've watched season 1 and 2, and there may be spoilers for those series.  But I consider that acceptable, because it's probably not a great idea to jump in on season 3, particularly with *this* anime.  Watch those first.I'll wait.Gosukomushi... Gosukomushi.. hey, wait.  Sumire!  Put down that rope!  And that palm frond!Okay, here we go!Wien Margarete might be the most interesting character in the whole ""Love! Live""...franchise, and might be one of my favorites in all of anime.In season 2, Wien (Margarete?  I guess there's some discussion/debate/otakufights, which consist of smacking each other with waifu catgirl tails) on that, but I maintain Wien is her LAST name) was a secondary character, who ended up being the ""Big Bad"" towards the end of the season.  She ended up losing, and the reason she ended up losing was made very clear.  She didn't know how to be an idol.  She was a spectacularly competent dancer/singer, but she had absolutely no idea how to connect with her audience.  In point of fact, she became an idol just to stick a fork in the eye of all the ""real"" idols.. and she failed.  Hard.  We left season 2 when she donned a Yuigaoka uniform and was going to go to school with Shibuya, for reasons we didn't understand at the time.In season 3, she has been upgraded to a main character, along with Tomari, the other new addition to Liella!.  Well...  maybe.I think it's fair to say that this season is, in part, an exploration of the redemption of Wien, who left the previous season absolutely *hated* by pretty much everyone.  I refuse to say how that turns out, clearly - firstly, because the season isn't over, and secondly, because I don't want to spoil.  But given the way Wien's character was introduced, I think you can probably take an educated guess or two as to how it might turn out, and you have a decent chance of at least coming close to the mark.  Let's just say I think she's the most interesting character for a *reason*.I'm only on ep. 8 at the moment (as is everyone else) but this isn't exactly the most unpredictable of seasons - if it doesn't turn out in a very predictable and specific way, I'll be *shocked*.  I mean, I've been surprised before, but at the moment, I'd put (a small amount of) money on the outcome.  But this is ""Love! Live"".  We're not here for a coherent story, or realism, or anything but a barely realistic musical where a bunch of girls have a dream of winning a competition, and nothing is going to stand in their way.  Not common sense, not realism, not typical high school girl competence.  These girls make professional music, professional costumes, professional stages, professional everything, even though in every other way they're just typical high school girls.  But, as with the previous two seasons, don't let that get in the way of enjoying this series.  It's a musical, and no one ever watches a musical with the idea that they're going to get a real or realistic *anything*.  It's just there for entertainment, and it delivers.  Nothing more than that, but if you wanted more than that, maybe watch ""Wake up girls!"", ""ID@LMASTER: Cinderalla Girls"" or maybe ""Girls band cry"".  But if you can accept this for what it is, you get to watch eleven girls singing, dancing, and sometimes even being nice to each other.Gosukomushi, gosukomushi..  *ahem*.  Oh, yeah, that costume makes an appearance.  Poor Sumire...Anyway, that's my preliminary review.  If you liked seasons 1 and 2, you'll like this, because it's more of the same, with an extra dose of Wien.  If you didn't like seasons 1 and 2, you'll probably not like this.  If you didn't like Wien, well, give it a chance.  She's not a bad girl.  Just really driven, and a little socially inept.Okay, that's a lot for a preliminary review.. Song for me!  Song for you!  Song for all!!!!Recommend from me."
Dandadan,"Preliminary thoughts, as I have not finished the show. Why does Japan love to put adolescents through weird sexual situations? Don't ask me. But if you are looking to see that, come watch this show. Now, that may seem very opinionated. But honestly, a lot of the scenes involving the above are unnecessary. Yeah, sure, aliens and ghosts thrive off of sexual energy and all that jazz, but then why are we watching legit kids deal with these creatures? Sure, this is a romance...Now I have watched ecchi shows before, but this is somewhat different because it's not trying to be ecchi, it almost...feels like the show is being artful in its depictions of a high schooler almost getting raped by aliens (bc that is legit the first episode.) And for sure, it has shock value, but I'm skeptical about its intention. And no, I don't apologize for being so aggressive with this review, but I didn't just give up anime for 5 years for no reason, there was a reason, namely shows like this.And before anyone comes for me saying, ""Oh, if you don't like it, don't watch it."" I need you to understand I watch anime because I love the medium of animation, and this show has spectacular animation. And that is the only reason I am continuing the show.Now, onto why I like the animation. Most of the scenes are beautifully drawn, and the action shots are amazing. But the one thing I was intrigued by the most was the beginning of the second episode and the depiction of the first scene through panels, very reminiscent of a page from a manga, namely with panels and black gutters separating action within scenes. Now, I have seen this a couple of times before, but this was truly lovely to watch, and I want to see more anime that have these sorts of cuts and edits.What initially drew me to this show was the animation and awesome cinematography, and while I am getting that, I am sort of missing the rest of it. I will continue to watch this show for the animation, and maybe my review will change, but... at the moment, I'm left disappointed."
Angel Beats!,"Reflections on Angel Beats!As I prepare for college, I find myself reflecting on Angel Beats! in a deeply personal way. Like many high school graduates, I feel the anxiety of stepping into a new chapter, leaving behind the comfort and safety I’ve known all my life. The fear of the unknown, the weight of regrets, and my insecurities often make me wish I could go back in time to fix my mistakes before moving forward.This anime mirrors those struggles with its poignant themes—letting go of past regrets, accepting the pain and joy of life, and embracing the journey rather than focusing solely on the destination....It’s a message I resonate with profoundly. Watching this story has encouraged me to view my life as my own unique journey, shaped by every experience, mistake, and achievement. It’s reminded me to find peace in who I’ve become and to keep moving forward with hope and courage.Angel Beats! has helped me at such an important moment in my life. It helped me confront my insecurities, accept my regrets, and gain a more positive outlook on the unknown future ahead. This anime exemplifies the power of storytelling and its ability to touch hearts, even years after its release.Final ThoughtsThis is truly my Anime of 2024—a masterpiece that holds a special place in my heart. Its bittersweet yet uplifting ending, combined with its powerful message of moving forward, has left an indelible impact on me. It’s a reminder to never forget the bonds I’ve formed, the experiences I’ve gained or lost, and to accept every part of my journey, whether good or bad.To Jun Maeda and Angel Beats!: Thank you for this unforgettable story.RatingAnime: 10/10 – A Masterpiece"
Peach Boy Riverside,"Oh boy they took a potentially great anime worth a 7 or 8 and turned it into a 2 simply because their editor or whatever idiot decided that ""a linear way of storytelling would be way too boring so we should add spotifys greatest feature instead!"" which gave us this ""MasTErpIecE"" of storytelling. I dont know what drugs they were on but i need to know so i can avoid that mindbreaking stuff so i wont fuck my dog or impregnate my sister. The Story had so much potential and yet they took it and shot it behind the dumpster like a stray dog with...rabies.2/10 because its watchable but thats all it is because youll end up pissed off by it, majorly so in fact."
Giji Harem,"Out of the many romance animes I've watched this is one of the most wholesome ones. An unique thing about it is that it's fast paced and it might feel like you are just watching a compilation of short moments at first. The progression between these two is also fast which makes it different from other romance animes. Rin is really cute and because of her acting you get to see so many different versions of her which is lovely. They did a good job of making teen romance feel like the most beautiful thing ever. I wish this anime was more popular because it...definitely deserves its rating, if not higher. If you love watching wholesome stuff this is the one :D"
Uchi no Kaisha no Chiisai Senpai no Hanashi,This show is very similar to your generic middle school romance anytime it has the same sort of plot and events  but it also feels different with it being an adult work Romance which is good as it was a nice change of pace from the school stuff it’s nice to see it happen in adult life and the working worlds to give the audience who watch the  school one when they’re in school old enough to watch the new oneI feel a genuine connection between these 2 characters which normally doesn’t happen but this time I do like what I see and...feel with the two protagonistThis is why I like it the only bad thing is how the show abruptly ended with no hint at a season 2 or anything.IMO I’ll probably watch season 2 if gets announced as I did resllly like it7/10
Kanojo mo Kanojo,"Naoya for the win!The first season of ""Girlfriend, Girlfriend"" was pretty enjoyable and fun to watch. We follow Naoya, who finally got Saki as his girlfriend after years of rejection, meeting Nagisa and realizing he loves these two girls. After begging Saki to open their relationship with Nagisa, she agrees and they enter a polygamous adventure where they encounter all sorts of trouble and obstacles to overcome. What really sold the show for me was the English dub produced by Studio Nano. Kevin D. Thelwell was extremely funny to listen to, with his over honesty and unintentionally funny remarks, he is easily the best character...out of this season. All positives aside, now the negatives. The animation is nothing impressive, in fact it's pretty weird and choppy. Some plot lines and choices don't really make any sense but I expected it. The opening and ending music isn't special and doesn't stand out. Yet despite these negatives, the positives out-weigh them by a slight margin. I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone who isn't into this genre of anime (as in degenerate ecchi harem shows)."
Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 3rd Season,"This is anime infuriates me. Re:zero started with a very strong first season where it looked like we are on a psychological, and dramatic path to untangle the origin of Subarus journey. What made it so good is the portrayal of suffering and not giving up.When I first watched the series i thought Subaru is a well written character but after the second season I realised the only reason i liked him is because i resonated with him when he suffered, beyond his suffering there is no further intention or motivation except being a fucking simp.Every other character is the equivalent to one...adjective like ""bad guy, cute girl, cute loli girl, edgy teen boy."" and Subaru is a big fucking coomer just like the person who wrote this shit. but because the plot is actually interesting in the beginning and the edgy bullshit is something that you can just dismiss. Season 2 is the start of the downfall, it lacks the seriousness the first season has, the dialogues start to stretch, the development of the story and action slows down, more unnecessary female cast gets introduced just for the sake sexualization or ""cuteness"".We are here in season 3 and its fucking horrible. the first episode 1 hour 30 minutes, and at the time from the scores i assumed ""lets go baby we're back"". I was wrong. The writer is so fucking focused on providing the plot what he wants to see for his sexual fantasies  that he completely lost whats this series is about or atleast everything that had a deeper meaning.But dont worry, if you are just like him or maybe 14 year old you will like this. No depth or a message just pure simping over girls like the biggest loser in school who doesnt get any pussy. At this point there are basically only lazy monotone dialogues, filled with unfunny anime jokes. Every second  person is a damn loli even the ""Lust witch"" is a loli, the  LUST  SIN .Like please I dont fucking care that you're a pedophile but atleast please hide it. I watched so many animeish anime slice of life, ecchi but this one takes the cake.For last I just wanna say i don't want to sound like Jesus and say this is morally bad or not, I dont fucking care, my point is that its so clear that the series lost its roots to dark fantasy, psychology just to some coomer writers dream that is painfully cringe."
Ao Ashi,"I started watching Ao Ashi after getting into Blue Lock and Clean Freak! Aoyama-kun. My kids are on a local football team, and I wanted to understand their perspective and feelings better. I never really did sports as a kid, but I played basketball in school and was pretty decent at it — though I only played during P.E. and didn’t have matches or training.As a parent, I sometimes worry about my kids losing interest in the things they love. They’re so passionate about football, and I want to support them however I can. Watching *Ao Ashi* gave me so much insight —...not just into football, but into how to understand their struggles and how to actually help them when they’re feeling stuck.This anime helped me connect with my kids in a way I hadn’t before. Now I watch them during their training sessions, and seeing their eyes sparkle as they talk about scoring goals and having fun with their friends just melts my heart. Kids grow up so fast, don’t they? It makes me so happy that I found this anime — it helped me understand my kids and their world a little better. Plus, it’s such a fun and interesting show!"
Another,"Another was the first anime I ever watched and it happened completely by accident! I was little — probably around 10 or 11 years old — and I was using my brother’s phone. I originally meant to look up Death Note because I’d missed the last few episodes on TV, but I ended up clicking on Another instead.Before that, I used to watch anime on TV, so this felt like a whole new world. I didn’t know any English at the time, so I didn’t fully understand what was happening in the story. I just remember being super confused about why everyone ignored...that one girl. But honestly, I didn’t care too much — I loved the art style, and the fact that it was horror made me like it even more! I was that kid who was obsessed with anything scary. I’d listen to scary stories all the time and get so excited about them.And then there was *that* famous umbrella scene. It freaked me out so much that I avoided umbrellas at school and at home for a while! Looking back, it’s kind of funny, but at the time, it really stuck with me.Even though I didn’t understand much of the plot, I had such a good time watching it. I’d even sing the opening song to myself while running home from school, staring at the fences like I was in my own anime scene. It’s such a nostalgic memory for me.Now that I’m older, I have mixed feelings about rewatching it. I’m scared it might ruin that special, nostalgic feeling I have toward the anime. So for now, I’ll leave it as it is — a childhood memory I treasure.If you’re curious about *Another*, I’d say go ahead and watch it, but don’t expect too much. It’s one of those shows that’s fun for what it is, but it might not be for everyone."
91 Days,"One of the things I loved most about 91 Days is the aesthetic and the soundtracks. I actually found the OST on YouTube back when I was still in high school, and I used to listen to it while studying for my history exams. The music really stuck with me, and it’s one of the reasons I decided to watch the anime in the first place.The anime has so much potential, but I feel like it didn’t fully deliver for me. It’s hard to explain — maybe it’s the ending that felt a bit unsatisfying? It’s not bad, though. I think the ending...works for what the story was going for, even if it wasn’t exactly what I hoped for.What stands out are the characters, the art style, and, of course, the amazing OST. The opening song, by the same artist who created the iconic *Tokyo Ghoul* opening, was such a treat. As a fan of his work, there was no way I could let *91 Days* pass me by.Overall, it’s a good anime, but don’t expect too much. It has its flaws, especially toward the last few episodes, which felt a little off to me. That said, I’d give it a solid 7/10 because of the beautiful aesthetic and soundtrack. The story is decent, but the ending just felt a bit weird."
FLCL: Grunge,"My opinions on the FLCL sequels have swung wildly and have surprised me both pleasantly and negatively....I'm sure it'll come as no surprise when I say that Grunge is utter dogshit and the most worthless anime I've seen.FLCL has never been One Piece in terms of length but Grunge takes the piss by taking the already breezy, movie-sized 6 episode runtime of OG, Progressive, and Alternative and cutting that in half.Additionally, it repeats a lot of the mistakes of Alternative and adds new ones on top.First, let's talk about a couple I didn't talk about that have stuck around from Alternative (between that and forgetting...to mention the Haruko rap scene... I should've been a bit more thorough in my Alternative review but whatever).First, the general idea of ""fuck this planet, we're heading to Mars"". I probably mentioned this in passing but the Earth (or at least the city that Grunge takes place in) is an absolute shithole now. It's so gross that they show a bunch of flies buzzing around and eating stuff like the termites from SpongeBob and honestly, I don't want to see that? It's kind of nasty? Why would you do this to me, Adult Swim?Anyway, I didn't like that plotline in Alternative and I don't like it in Grunge. Sure, a world where giant irons can just live in your world and maybe smush you isn't ideal but I never got the sense that it was a worthless planet and we gotta start over.The other one is just... why is Haruko here?Grunge at least makes a couple references to Atomsk so it's not like it ignores it completely but like Alternative, it just kind of pays lip service to the idea and Haruko is just fucking with these kids because she's bored, I guess?Why is she playing the role of the mayor's girl? Why is she working with the yakuza? Only one of the three protagonists even has an overflow, she's just kind of there.That last line has two big problems with Grunge hidden in it but let me take a little detour first.Why the fuck is The Thing hereI'm sorry, it's been a couple years since I've last seen the original FLCL but when were there big rockmen in my FLCLIn fact, why is the yakuza here?It feels like they're throwing shit in here to be throwing shit in here because this is the fourth season of FLCL, quick, come up with anything so we don't have to bring back Naota and Samejima!Speaking of The Thing, let's talk about the fact that there are THREE protagonists in a THREE-episode series.It's the same problem Alternative had but worse because Grunge decides to focus on each protagonist for an episode but, like, the other two are still kinda there, it's not like an anthology. And this results in protagonists so forgettable that it takes all my brainpower not to call the girl ""Oshi no Ko"" and I genuinely can't remember The Thing's name and I just watched it (I just checked, it's Shonari... I thought it was Shotaro/Shutaro).I probably only remember Not Naota's because it's literally Shin.And here's the thing (as opposed to The Thing, haha), rightIt's not just not an anthology, it's kind of sort of one of those stories where the episodes tie into each other. Girl makes The Thing a katana and The Thing uses katana in Not Naota's story, stuff like that.Which would theoretically be fine but that means in this THREE EPISODE story, they reuse a decent amount of footage.This THREE EPISODE story, mind you, that looks godawful because they decided to do it in shitty 3D. I couldn't tell if my computer was crashing out or if it was just the awful animation sometimes. For whatever bad things I have said about Alternative, it is at least decently produced. It looks fine, it's not as hyper as OG or Progressive but what is there is well-made.Grunge doesn't even have that going for it.Speaking of the OG, as per usual, you've got your fanservice. The usual suspects are here (including LAST DINOSAUR, which I audibly groaned when I heard it) but this time, we've got an unpleasant surprise. Commander Amarao is back! I mean, I guess he's fine for what he does in the story but this is ""Never Knows Best on a jenga block"" levels of fanservice that didn't need to be here.The music sure is. *nods*Moving on.I did mention that only one of the three protagonists has an overflow, right? And I do mean AN overflow. One.That wouldn't be so bad but it's a symptom of the bigger problem. There are basically no mech fights, we get like one or two fights against faceless yakuza thugs (literally, I'm pretty sure they have the same face canonically) and then a short fight between Haruko and a mech.This series has bad animation, characters you'll forget the second after you watch them, it continues to actively ruin the world of FLCL, it is just a godawful series with nothing worthy of note.I've said for series I've found godawful before that AT LEAST it's useful for completionists who are fans of the author (usually because at least there's a much better source material that it's adapting so you can see what it was MEANT to be after). This isn't even that. If you like FLCL, hell, even if you liked Progressive or Alternative, DO NOT WATCH THIS!!!Only watch it if you are a masochist and you truly want to see how bad it is for yourself.The only saving grace is that at least Shoegaze can't be worse, right?Right?Hey, wait... no, no, no, wait, wait, wait-"
Ousama Game The Animation,"it was horrible awful! the main protagonist with the brown hair, Nobuaki? i think that's his name? he's VERY MUCH a crybaby throughout the season...every other episode he is LITERALLY crying in tears over some bull s*** -___- imagine being a grown a** high school male and you cry every episode...hes a soft a** mofo im just being honest. i dont have any respect for cry babies like that. so i just cant see past that. he had absolutely no back bone. and this is your main character representing this series.  2/10 this is not even an exaggeration man, like the amount of times...the main character cries is cringe worthy and he just gives off beta energy vibes because of it. if you have seen this show yhou know im not lying. and if you hav not seen it, you will see what im talking about, but i still recommend watching. save your time and watch something else"
Marvel Future Avengers,"As a long-time Marvel content viewer, including the other anime produced by Madhouse, I found it remarkable that this title was released when the Marvel Cinematic Universe was at its peak, especially during the time of ""Infinity War."" However, it's important to note that, at its release, characters like the Fantastic Four and the X-Men were unlikely to appear in any form. The only exception was Deadpool, given his immense popularity.Some tropes in this anime are quite obvious, while others may catch you off guard. There is also an intriguing mystery that invites further investigation. You can spot influences from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, particularly...in the designs of characters like Iron Man and the Wasp, among others. Although the pacing may be inconsistent in some areas, it shouldn't be a significant issue. The story is primarily aimed at younger audiences, but there is still plenty for adults to enjoy.Yet when the plot kicks up the energy, the main ringleader for the events that transpired. While the characters have already appeared in live-action, they are mostly based on their Comic counterpart rather than their film counterpart.This anime will be best if you want to satisfy your Marvel or superhero cravings without having to watch other hero animes."
Look Back,"Look Back is a phenomenal adaptation of the manga One Shot by Tatsuki Fujimoto of Chainsaw Man fame. The animation and visuals are incredibly unique yet beautiful. There are so many scenes that are mesmerizing to look at. The music score by Haruka Nakamura is wonderful and helps elevate the emotional impact of every scene.What makes this stand out against other animated movies is the exceptionally grounded and genuine story. It is a bittersweet and emotionally provoking look at pursuing passion while being a coming-of-age story. Even with the short hour-long runtime, the story delivers a rollercoaster of emotions that will definitely stick with you...even after it is over. This is a must-watch!"
Yuri!!! on Ice,"Picture this, a wacky comedy a la Konosuba has a baby with the gutwrenchingly dark deep dive into the entertainment world a la Oshi no Ko... there, now you have Yuri!!! On IceThis seemingly innocent tale of ice and a lil love is littered with minute but obvious tell-tale signs of the brutal reality of competitive sports and the traumas left on it's contestants. As they each navigate their way to the Grand Prix Finale while finding various ways to cope with their mental health, we the audience are there to sit along for the unfiltered ride ready to laugh our butts off, cringe at...the WTF moments, and be in absolute awe of their spectactular breath stopping performances all within the blink of an eyeA massive rollercoster of conflicting themes crunched into a studio apartment, on paper this should not work in the slightes, and yet it does, and to perfectionAlthough i would've liked to see more of these characters, i think the rushed nature of the series is actually what made it work so well in the storytelling format it chose, had certain things been dragged out in more detail it would've needed a much darker tone to not start feeling weird"
Bartender: Kami no Glass,"To drink is not a mere act of self-indulgence; it is a ritual, a moment of connection, and a celebration of life’s fleeting beauty. In Bartender, every glass served at Edenhall becomes a vessel, not just for the drink itself, but for the stories, emotions, and memories it evokes. Each sip is a journey through time, drawing out feelings we thought were lost or buried, connecting us to moments and people who shaped our lives.Edenhall is more than a bar; it’s a sanctuary where these memories are preserved, trapped like fireflies in their corresponding frames of time. The bartender, Ryuu Sasakura, acts as a guide,...gently coaxing these memories to the surface with the perfect cocktail for each soul who seeks solace. The stories woven around these drinks remind us that our experiences—joys, regrets, triumphs, and heartbreaks—are worth savoring, just like the finest liquor.This profound perspective on drinking is something I’ll carry with me. It transforms every drink I partake in into more than just a refreshment; it becomes a moment to reflect, rejoice, and embrace the tapestry of memories that define us. Through Bartender, I’ve come to see that the act of drinking is not about escaping reality, but about finding a deeper connection to it, one glass at a time."
Uzumaki,"Uzumaki is Junji Ito denouncing the theory of beauty, namely the golden ratio itself. This divine proportion, typically proved using the fibonacci sequence, mathematically establishes the repetition of spiral perfection in all things of nature. It's considered objectively beautiful due to the sense of visual balance that comes with that coiled formation of illusion and harmony. In the series, Ito negates our notion of spirals, and the grim shape is now a source of confusion and horror. The anime adaptation captures the eeriness well I feel, although like any other entry into this genre, animation doesn't lend itself to horror like live action would. Thus,...my expectations for it were more so the unsightly and strange, which is exactly what is offered, visually at least. Across the four episodes, it's clear that various story arcs are concatenated to maximize content over necessarily cohesion. It discards complete coherency, with countless instances of the story veering off on its own without the viewer's attention. I'm willing to partially overlook this given the length of the adaptation and the fact that it works as an anthology-like collection of stories within the same town, affected by the same curse.That aside, the adaptation primarily suffers from its apparent inconsistent production. Most gripes stem from a comparison between the pilot episode and the rest of the adaptation, but on a more overall note, my qualm is the odd choices of where the animation quality returns to decency. The second episode is by far the biggest disappointment of the bunch, whereas the final two are more or less among the average expected output from most seasonals. My takeaway here is that producer Jason DeMarco should be out of a job, particularly given his recent track record. In any case, the rotoscoping dies down past the opening arc, and from there, the animation is centered around highlighting phenomena over character acting. Regularly, the models will stray off in accuracy, although Uzumaki gets by on imagery rather than concurrent movement. Colin Stetson is a major asset here, and his soundtrack compensates for some of the dreary experience that may have been lost. The audio is like a string waltz, looping as to sonically translate spirals. Stetson's instrumental distortion creates a madness in the score and has listening value independent from the series.Narratively, Uzumaki has little to no clear direction, and it appears that the goal was to have rapidly paced storytelling spiraling out of control. This is less convincing in view of the production, but one could argue that it's a fair claim in the context of the town decaying. There are very few lingering connections between the events episode-to-episode outside of recurring characters. The staff opted for covering material at the expense of palpable tension, leading to numerous scenes of supernatural things being shown without capable framing of the central theme. Spirals are not the dominant motif; they are a device to imply commentary on anti-perfectionism and the relationship between isolated towns and the larger world. While the dizzying pattern is omnipresent, the characters are outlets for cosmic body horror. A longer adaptation doesn't solve any of its issues because Ito's plot structure is built around the escalation of paranoia, not developing a cast. This is purely a case of needing a better production timeline with an actual visionary director. One can only hope that the monochrome concept inspires other Ito adaptations to be daring in style or unorthodox in presentation. The spiral is relentless until all living things have intertwined as one, and perhaps that itself is beauty."
Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon,"It's not the first time I've tried to watch it, held back at each attempt by the feeling of having to deal with a rather basic comedy series. So with the third attempt, I tried to hang on to see what it's really worth, and... It was soo good!I was really surprised by the themes and the rich development of some of the characters. Even for the first few episodes, which are, in fact, a good overview of the subtle narrative efficiency of the work. There are a few flaws, notably a few Japanese clichés for which I'm clearly not the public, but they represent...such a small portion of the series that it's pretty negligible in the end.Very good anime !"
Buddy Daddies,"This anime had several moments that made my heart ache, especially when they both sat and watch the kid simply being a kid and realized some deeper stuff about parenting or just having someone in your life. Those scenes were particularly moving. I was hoping for more focus on Rei and his father in that one episode—I really wanted to learn more about his past. Overall, it's a great show with a satisfying ending. Being a parent myself made me laugh so hard at some point and it has good life lessons for young adults imo. I'd say you should give this anime a try."
Yeosin Gangnim,"Right off the back, I will give this animation adaptation a 7.5/10. Let me go over my reasoning.Real quick, I have not read the manga, nor have I seen the actual K drama, I've only seen the animation which is what I'll be reviewing.First off, I think the animation is good. Not great but good. though at times it looked like one of those game screens one in a blue moon and would throw mw off, or at least that's how I see it.  The color and animation were good, I don't have many complaints about it, other thank the still screen...like blue lock from time to time.Secondly, I like the story line, girl gets bullied goes to a new school to try and reinvent herself in hopes she doesn't repat past drama and along the way finds herself with great friends and along the way ends up falling in love.Lastly, the only other complaint I have is that the last few episodes felt rushed. Not to mention that ending. The ending could have been longer or at least one more episode.There really isn't a need for a season 2 but I hope there is, because I would watch.if you're looking for anime that has comedy, romance, and drama then check this one out. This isn't an anime that you would watch multiple times but it one to just check out in case you can't find anything to watch."
Blue Lock,Story is Ash Ketchum style thus childish where is more for children than for adults.Adult would say it's pseudo developing football but somebody looking just for a little bit of fun would go along with it.Every two episodes there is major surprise which is good and the major character isn't who you think it is.For me anime is a 10.If you want to get 10/10 watching this anime i recommend Aoashi after you have watched this anime because latter shows real world.Personally anime is very fresh and thus worth watching only other competition in football for this anime is Captain Tsubasa.
Ningen Fushin no Boukensha-tachi ga Sekai wo Sukuu you desu,"It started strong with a cool premise and interesting cast with tragic backstories. Then after episode 4 they stop going to dungeons or adventuring and the rest is pure filler. So disappointing. Who green lit this trash?I'm not even exaggerating. Have an episode just messing around, one doing math, another gambling, another that is the backstory of some character not even in the party that is irrelevant, 3 episodes that are just a filler messing around in town looking into a rumored person, then closing out with messing around in town filler.Despite the premise that the group would eventually one day save the world, they...waste the entire show not even starting down even in the direction of that path, making no progress whatsoever. It's just pure wasted potential."
Hidamari Sketch,"I definitely did go into this series with high-ish expectations because I’m a fan of the genre. And there is definitely a lot of potential on display in this series, especially in the first episode with a great cast of characters that I can look forward to watching them grow. But where this anime fails to fulfill that potential with animation that is incomplete at best and pretty psychedelic so the visual look of the show isn’t very good.I’m still going to carry on because I’m hoping that it gets better but it definitely got off to a rough start."
Dandadan,"Had the Comedy/Romance/Ecchi trend not died out, it would've flourished with the same type of marketing which this anime has had, but alas, they always lacked an intricate story and were just there with randomness and fan-service for a quick fix of dopamine. It is strange how it was one of the most disliked genres, despite that, this anime can succeed with similar elements. Why?Well, with the catchy intro, initial fan-service, meme-able moments and ""badass"" fight scenes, which makes it spread like wildfire on social media, it is not surprising. Unfortunately, most people are deluded into thinking that popularity/hype = masterpiece when it is far...from it. This anime is very ordinary in every aspect and it lacks class compared to the greats. It has amazing comedy, but that's all there is to it. It is a lazy, albeit clever and successful attempt to captivate the people of todays restless- and regressive society.Don't get me wrong, it is entertaining, cool and it's worth watching, but it does not deserve the hype nor the overly high rating in its current stage. Raise your standards."
FLCL Progressive,"Tbh, I went in expecting these FLCL sequels to be dogshit at worst and mid at best but this one... actually kind of rocks?I watched this after Alternative so maybe it just looked better by comparison but I think the major thing that makes it better than Alternative (and just a good show in general) is that it's LIVELYProgressive dials back how many characters we focus on to really just the one. There's also Ide (and as per usual, Haruko), but Hidomi is the star of the show. She's kind of antisocial but I thought she was a nice, simple, pleasant protagonist to center the...show on.Because while the show does focus a lot on Hidomi, this is also by and large Haruko's show.Which brings me to the most important character I haven't brought up yet, Jinyu. I think the idea of Haruko having a... twin? I'm just gonna say twin. I think the idea of Haruko having a twin who is the responsible other half of Haruko is an inspired idea that gives Haruko something to chew on other than to be the WaCkY girl who chases after Atomsk. No pun intended....although speaking of which, what the fuck is up with the vore, Adult Swim? You got something you wanna tell us? I did not need to see Haruko with a bulging belly for an extended period of time.I will say though, there were a few undercooked characters, particularly the ones keeping an eye on the situation? The ""champion"" eyepatch old guy and the baseball guy or whatever, did not care an iota about them. Ide's friends are whatever, Aiko is slightly cooler but really, once you get past the main cast, there just isn't enough time to devote to the others.Even Hidomi gets an episode in the middle where she becomes ""happy"" because headphone malfunction or whatever and it was kinda cringey (although nothing can beat that Haruko rap in Alternative which I forgot to mention) and it just kind of gives the show an excuse to do nothing with Marco after he overflows.When I reviewed Alternative, I kinda rolled my eyes at a lot of the FLCL OG references and while a lot of those (although, notably, there was not a drop of ""Never Knows Best"" which is good because I feel like that's something that should've stayed OG-exclusive) references are still in Progressive, I think Progressive working more as a canonical sequel (at least from Haruko's perspective, we do not see the human FLCL OG characters again, which I am fine with) makes it feel more palatable. By the time LAST DINOSAUR played (the second time), for example, it didn't feel cheap and pandery to me (although it probably ""objectively"" was), maybe it's because I was in more of a good mood but it felt earned, more or less?Speaking of LAST DINOSAUR, The Pillows are back and while I think this is the worst of the 3 EDs between OG, Alt, and Prog, it's decent. There were some great tracks on here, such as THE THIRD EYE. While it does have fondness for playing songs from the original FLCL, there are some good tracks outside of the OG soundtrack.I saw someone call this the Force Awakens of FLCL and I think that's true. This is less of, ironically, a progression in FLCL and more of a victory lap but given that this is a belated sequel that Adult Swim ordered because ""FLCL OG good"", I consider it a victory that we even got something this good. This feels like a comeback album from a band who had been making bad albums for a decade or two and we get a nice clean fresh breath of air, even if it's just them revisiting their old stomping grounds. Is it as good as their breakout hit? No, but it's just nice to see an album that proves they can pick up a guitar.(I compared it a lot to Alternative in this review and yes, it is far better than Alt, but I do think Progressive is a legitimately good show in its own right, although it's obviously not as good as the OG FLCL)"
Samurai Champloo,"Samurai Champloo's rights are semi-gods.Samurai Champloo has a great beginning and this is largely due to the directors. The way the story fits together almost perfectly is wonderful. There are many details and a great anime to watch several times.Mugen is a great protagonist. He represents a samurai with a mind and fighting style ahead of his time.Jin is also great. He represents the classic samurai, both in his clothes and in his fighting style.Fuu represents the Japanese woman from the future who loves adventure. I liked her humor, I found it much better than the humor of other female characters in other animes.The soundtrack...is good. It mixed well with the songs that end the anime and it was very good. I really liked it.That said, I give it a 9 and it is almost perfect. Out of the 26 episodes, I only didn't like two episodes."
Blue Lock vs. U-20 Japan,"I dno.t know what the studio is doing , either there is huge budget issue going on for the studio, or the animators are lazy lazy as hell. The season 1 was a bang . Eye candy to be honest with you allbut season 2 so the U-20 arc is like watching a Power-point slide show . with primitive dialogue animation on the lips, my younger brother can emulate this scenario on Power-point if given a little training. even the manga it self has more animation panels in it than the ongoing mess that's coming out each Saturday. players running with their hands still..., and only the ball is rotating , seriously!!!!?????"
Nageki no Bourei wa Intai shitai,"I Think This Anime is probably one of The Most Underrated Animes This season but why you might ask ?The Story is Krai , he is out mc and the star of this show , well you see Krai and his friends cot teleported into an dirrent fantasy world and all his friends got skills and talents over powered honestly but not krai he's just a normal dude and and they deicded to make krai the leader of their Party and that party got pretty popular a few years later , what makes this anime so fun and intersting to watch is how very one...thinks that krai is this overpowered monster yet he have no power , also there is alot of fun side characters that interacts with krai in such way that its just so fun to watch , also Alot of hot anime girls so that always a plus ,so its just a fun anime to watch , its dosen't take it self very seriously but i think that okay becuasae not every anime needs to be this heavy story tellergive it a watch you will have a fun time with it"
Jujutsu Kaisen 2nd Season,"THIS IS A SPOILER-FREE REVIEWAlright, this is gonna be a big one.Every generation has an anime that served as their main entrance point into the medium. For me personally, “MyHeroAcademia” was that show, back in the year 2016. Before that it was Attack on Titan. Before that there were the big 3, One Piece, Bleach and Naruto. Right now, as of 2024, “Jujutsu Kaisen” has risen to the absolute top of the anime world. The fantastic first season and the wonderful prequel movie “Jujutsu Kaisen Zero” did a great job at catapulting this show out of the anime community and into the general mainstream....This is definitely the one anime that even people who never watch anime normally, got into. The expectations for season two were enourmous, with manga readers hyping up the content that will be adapted in season two to a ridicoulous degree. But did this show deliver on everything it promised? Lets get into this extra long review for the generational Jujutsu Kaisen season two!Story – 8/10I just talked about manga readers that already knew what will happen in this season, and i can actually say that i was one of them. I read the manga almost three years ago and as soon as i finished this part, i knew exactly that it was gonna pop off. This season adapts two arcs of the manga that are very different from each other so i will take my time and review both individually here.Episode 1-6: The Hidden Inventory – Gojo´s PastThis arc was a very pleasant surprise. The show takes us back into the year 2006, and focuses mainly on the relationship of Gojo Satoru and Suguru Geto as they try to protect a highly important character from the ruthless Toji Zen´in. There are a bunch of fantastic action setpieces and the animation is already insane, but at it´s core, this really is the first Jujutsu Kaisen arc that actually laid the main focus on character development instead of action. The tone is much lighter than other arcs and there is a certain 2000s summer feel to the whole storyline. I thought this was the perfect place for the series to pick up after season one. These six episodes were super fun and highly enjoyable. The story of Gojo and Getos friendship actually hit the right emotional spots, especially after watching the Jujutsu Kaisen Zero movie. The final fight of this arc was also one of my favourites in the whole series. We saw Gojo dominate everything in his way for pretty much all of the previous arcs, but here he is truly at his limit for the first time. Really cool stuff.However, there are issues here that have plaqued Jujutsu Kaisen since the beginning of it´s run: pacing and worldbuilding. I think the whole “world of jujutsu” this manga is set in, is not build up very well. The pacing is just waaaaay to fast. A lot of newer shounen struggle with this, mostly because of their production cycle and the immense pressure on the mangaka to pump out chapter after chapter to retain the hype of the series, making it extremely hard to plan ahead with the story. The whole foundation of Jujutsu Kaisen is pretty shaky at best. The author has to constantly explain the power system, which is just all over the place. He introduces a lot of interesting concepts but there is absolutely nothing that pulls it all together, so most of the fights are more visual spectacle than strategic and well thought out. So, does that mean the show lost me? Absolutely notEpisode 7-23: The Shibuya IncidentThis right here is the arc that changed everything. When it aired weekly, the internet was completely on fire. At this point in the story, every single character, both heroes and villains, come together in Shibuya for a showdown that shakes the foundation of the whole world. This arc is absolutely crazy. This really is just a 16-episode, all-out, martial-arts, action-fantasy rollercoaster ride that starts slowly and keeps escalating more and more and more to absolutely insane degrees of hype and excitement. The episodes just flow into each other perfectly, making this one of the best binge-watching experiences i´ve ever had (Keep in mind, I KNEW WHAT WILL HAPPEN). Every single episode is better than the last. The stakes are massive and the fights are as well. Every single character gets his time to shine. I absolutely love the eery, cramped setting in Tokios underground system and all the real-life locations. The villains plot is just so unbelievably cruel and brutal. At this point, the show does not hold itself back in the slightest anymore. People die, not just the villains and the heroes, but also everyone in a radius of multiple kilometres gets pulled into the fight, making this one of the darkest and most destructive scenarios in shounen history.This also marks the first time that Jujutsu Kaisen managed to touch me on an emotional level. Before this arc, it was just a fun, hype, action-fantasy. But this season had a huge amount of emotional weight to it, especially in regards to our main character, Yuji Itadori.All of the problems i talked about before still remain a factor in this arc, but honestly, a show does not need to have perfect writing, perfect worldbuilding or perfect pacing to be enjyoable. I am willing to look over these flaws, accepting the show like it is: A fast-paced, hype, action roller-coaster.This will stand as one of modern animes best story-arcs. Give it like, 5, maybe 10 years and a new generation of anime fans will call this a classic.Art – 10/10Studio MAPPA has been infamous for years for their absolutely crazy workload. They are definitely the biggest, most influential anime studio of the modern age, and they just absolutely churn out hit after hit after hit. Their incredible trackrecord now includes shows like “Attack on Titan”, “Chainsaw Man” and many more. However, in recent years, people started to notice that things are getting shaky for the studio. Multiple reports of production issues hurt their reputaion a lot. Attack on Titan was a prime example of that. But with the second season of Jujutsu Kaisen, it apparently got even worse. Working on this show was absolute hell for the animators. The incredible workload, the tight schedule and of course the countless high-intensity action scenes required for the Shibuya-arc absolutely crippled the studio to it´s core. They pulled everything they had into this season. Every single creative idea, every single design choice they had laying around to fulfill the high expectations people had in this arc. And it absolutely shows.This show does not take a single break. It starts absolutely insane and not only is the animation itself highly dynamic, creative and well edited, the quality also increases with every single episode. Everytime you think that they peaked, the show throws a new animation concept, a new artstyle, new camera angles, new effects and much, much more onto the screen. The scope and scale of the fights get bigger and bigger, and the animation keeps up the pace again and again. This is not like shows like “Demon Slayer” or “MyHeroAcademia”, which mostly reserve the big scenes for the climax: It really is a constant stream of sakuga that grabs you and does not let go up until the final episode.Sound – 8/10The soundtrack of JJK is always a treat to hear, and this season started of really strong. The OP of the first part was beautiful and perfectly fitted the concept of the arc itself. The second opening introduces the much darker second arc perfectly. The BGM itself uses a mix of older songs from the  previous seasons and a bunch of newer songs. The crazy jazz section that played during Gojos first fight, the gritty theme of Aoi Todo and many more standout moments give the show a lot of personality. The older songs do hit a bit better than the newer ones, and i think there was more room for some vocal tracks here and there. This season probably has my least favourite soundtrack of the whole series so far, but that just shows how consitently good the music in this show really is.Characters – 8/10First off, lets talk about Suguru Geto. His role in the first arc was wonderful. From all the villains in this show, he is my absolute favourite, because the show spends a lot of time on his backstory, his relationships and him slowly distancing himself from everyone because of his differing believe system.Our protagonist Yuji Itadori was another huge standout. He truly goes through the five stages of grief in this season. Being pushed to the absolute physical limit and seeing his friends and companions die, one after another, leads him down a rough path to stay true to his ideals. Super emotional and heartbreaking stuff here. The different side-characters were also a ton of fun. Especially Jogo had an insane amount of screen presence, and his interactions with Sukuna were an absolute blast to watch.The same goes for Nanami, a character i already loved in the first season. Unfortunately, because this is a spoiler-free review, i can´t get into my favourite character moments, because, yes, a lot of them revolve around death (or worse) and other circumstances. Although this show does not spend much time on character development, especially in the second arc, everyone is at least very, very memorable. That is a huge plus, if you think about the crazy amount of characters that play a role in this season.Enjoyment – 9/10This experience was absolutely worth it. Altough i always enjoyed diving deep into the ocean of anime to find these rare, exceptional undergroung shows that perfectly fit my personal taste, i still enjoy the absolute mainstream juggernauts of the medium to the same extent. This is a must-watch show for every single anime and non-anime fan and it will be talked about for a long time both in-and outside the community, if you like it, or not.- Marco_YoooFINAL SCORE - 9/10"
Akatsuki no Yona,"Being the lonely mf that I am, one day I had an urge to watch a good romance that would make me feel even worse. A quick Google search turned up a top 50 MAL list that promised Yona of the Dawn was a “must watch” shoujo masterpiece. I suppose in that sense, they were right. In the realm of shoujo, Yona of the Dawn is decent, but that is ignoring what it truly is: a bundled up collection of overused tropes.Yona of the Dawn follows its titular pretty spoiled princess on her journey to becoming a fierce warrior… and that premise is good...until you realize you actually never get what you were promised. Yona is supposed to be growing and becoming independent, but all she’s doing is collecting servants. Yona is surrounded by all these capable people that she basically forced into servitude, and not once does she think to try to learn their skills. What kind of progress is Yona making if she’s ousted from her cushy palace life, but then gets five bishonen bodyguards that worry themselves to death if even a single hair on her head is out of place? The plot is basically a reverse harem with extra steps. You’ve got all manner of boyfriends: the childhood friend, the princely goofball, the introvert with trauma, etc. All of them are bound to Yona by the legacy of her hair. Again, they have no choice in it either, so there goes any interesting subversion. Her new friends are actually just lifelong servants who listen to everything she says because it’s destined.Halfway through the series, the main conflict of the show isn’t explained or even mentioned apart from the opening sequence. The supposed villain can’t even figure out his own motivations, much less the audience. It just happens, and then we get a double narrative situation (Yona and the villain contrasting their lives) that is completely irrelevant. Now, the double narrative could have been cool if Yona’s development brought her into direct conflict with the villain. However, her reason for collecting her boyfriends is very simply, “to live”. That’s all. At this point in the plot, Yona’s goal cannot be only “to live”. That’s everyone’s goal. What is she going to do with her life when she finishes her collection? We don’t know. Granted, I haven’t gotten to the part where she gathers everyone, but she shows no sign of thinking beyond present. At the very least, Yona isn’t even thinking of the state of her country (up until this point).And of course, Yona herself is the most useless one of the lot. At around the 40% mark in the series, we are shown Yona trying to learn a skill, and putting all of her effort into it. The show really pushes that this is huge character development for Yona, but it’s kinda just a nothing burger. Yona cannot possibly believe that mastering one skill will allow her to be independent. That’s like thinking your perfect sunny side up guarantees you can live for a year in the woods. But then, Yona has five capable boyfriends, so maybe it’s more realistic that she doesn’t think she needs to learn much.Yona of the Dawn has a whole host of other issues. However, its main problem is that it relies too much on the opening sequence (where the main conflict happens) to carry all of its exposition and setup. Everything Yona does is in reaction to this main conflict, but with a bit of critical thinking we can see there is nothing of substance. Yona of the Dawn wants to have a central cast with cute quirks like Ouran High School Host Club, but in a story meant to be about personal growth, it just doesn’t work.And I still ended up not satisfying my romance anime urge. Maybe I’ll go watch A Silent Voice or something.Final Rating: 5"
Sakamichi no Apollon,"Just finished watching it, and wow what an emotional ride. For those who haven’t seen it, it’s a coming of age story set in 1960s Japan, revolving around friendship, love, and jazz. It’s got that perfect mix of heartfelt storytelling and musical brilliance.What makes this anime so special isn’t just the jazz, though that’s phenomenal it’s the way it captures the raw, bittersweet nature of youth. The relationships feel real they are messy, complicated, and full of moments that remind you of your own struggles with growing up. Kaoru, Sentaro, and Ritsuko’s dynamics hit hard because they’re so human. There’s tension, misunderstandings, and...unspoken emotions, but there’s also warmth, loyalty, and that unshakable bond that only true friends share.The music isn’t just a backdrop it’s the heartbeat of the show. The jam sessions, especially on the piano and drums, are so alive that they feel like a character in their own right. Jazz becomes this metaphor for connection, freedom, and expression, tying everything together.But it’s not just about the happy moments. It hits you with that nostalgic ache, the kind where you long for something even as you experience it. It’s a story about fleeting moments, about how people come into your life and leave their mark, even if they don’t stay forever. The ending? Poignant and beautiful, leaving you with just the right amount of closure while still making you reflect.If you’re into character-driven stories with a strong emotional core, this one’s a must watch. It’s a masterpiece in showing how music and friendship can shape who we are, and it left me feeling both uplifted and melancholic. Easy 9/10."
Araburu Kisetsu no Otome-domo yo.,"I wanted to like this show. The topic is interesting, but usually poorly done and this was no exception. Almost all the characters unrealistically, despite the show trying to portray realistic emotions. Not in a unpredictable teenager kind of way, but in a no-one-would-ever-behave-like-that kind of way. When confronted by problems the cast comes off as easily brushing them aside, incredibly dumb, or malicious for no reason. The build up is very poor and a lot of the drama comes on too fast or seemingly without cause. Without spoilers I will say the ending was super forced and everything wraps up immediately. The complicated ideas...the show brings up are done in a shallow way, maybe because there are too many. I cannot tell if these topics were fumbled or if morally deficient or questionable points were made on purpose as a ""happy ending"" for every single problem.4/10It was enjoyable in some places, but, overall. I would rather not have watched it. In my opinion."
Dance in the Vampire Bund,"Overview:Anime about vampires certainly aren't anything new, and Studio Shaft, the same people behind ""Puella Magi Madoka Magica"", is well-known for making such anime, having created several over the years. One such anime is ""Dance in the Vampire Bund"", which unfortunately is pretty average as far as the genre goes. While I did enjoy it quite a bit, it is nevertheless heavily flawed, with a number of good qualities being held back by a number of not-so-good qualities.Story (6/10):""Dance in the Vampire Bund"" is set in modern-day Japan, in a world where vampires exist and have lived in isolation for centuries. Until now, that is,...as Mina Tepes, the ruler of all vampires, announces their existence to the world, with the intention of creating a special district from her people known as the Bund, hence the title. Naturally, however, creating such a haven proves to be no easy task, as humans have believed them to be monsters, and there are many other vampires who believe in dominating humanity rather than co-existing with them. Besides Mina, the series also follows Akira Kaburagi Regendorf, a young amnesiac teenager who learns one day that he is actually a werewolf (yes, they exist in this world too) and the chosen guardian of Mina. Following this revelation, Akira joins forces with Mina as he gradually remembers more and more about his history with her, and they work together to establish peace between humanity and fight back against the forces that don't want that to happen.The idea of the story is quite promising, being about a supernatural race of creatures that are far more complex than believed by the public, and are trying to find their place in a world that fears and reviles them. However, the execution is disappointing; pacing is poor (the first episode is almost entirely about the existence of vampires being announced to the world, with Akira not even appearing until the second episode), exposition is rare and often vague and so many tired anime clichés are thrown at you, from high school to a love triangle, none of which are presented in a way that makes them feel fresh or interesting, meaning that they only serve to drag down the narrative rather than enrich it.The three races' focus in the story is also incredibly uneven, with the vampires getting the lion's share and there only being one major character in the other two races. This is especially jarring considering it's explicitly stated early on that many humans wouldn't accept the existence of vampires, yet we hardly see any conflict between the two races. The only human with any real focus in the series is Yuki Saegusa, who comes into conflict with Mina not because of any fear or hatred of vampires, but because they both have feelings for the same guy (Akira), which really cheapens the story's themes. As a whole, a good chunk of the story is spent on the conflict between Mina and other high-ranking members of her race, which just makes the series feel like countless other vampire stories. The series also ends with pretty much nothing resolved, as none of the series' main villains have been defeated and the ending makes it clear that Mina and Akira's work is far from done. As a whole, the story is just one small fraction of what it could have been.Art & Animation (8.5/10):""Dance in the Vampire Bund"" is a very good-looking series, especially considering it came out in 2010. The characters are very well-drawn and detailed and the environments look great as well. That said, the visuals are far from flawless, with a major problem being the gratuitous fanservice, a lot of which involves Mina, who despite being centuries-old looks like a little girl. Most of the time, anyway; there are occasions when she transforms into her older-looking, true form, which is nearly always completely naked save for armour protecting her private parts (and even that's not guaranteed). The series also has this strange effect where the camera goes all over a given character's body and zooms in on them, which is pretty effective in some scenes but just plain silly in others.Sound & Dialogue (8.5/10):The soundtrack is generally quite moody and atmospheric, even if no particular tracks that play during the episodes themselves come to mind. The opening and ending themes are great, especially the former which is unlike any other anime song I have ever heard, and good enough that I listened to it at the start of every episode. When it played at the start, that is, as there are occasions when the ending theme plays at the start of an episode and the opening plays at the end, which I can't remember being done in any other anime. The voice acting is great as well; Monica Rial really gets to show her range as the two forms of Mina and the dub has a strong cast in general that includes Eric Vale (Akira), Alexis Tipton (Yuki), Colleen Clinkenbeard, Todd Haberkorn and Patrick Seitz. All in all, the sound design is easily of the better parts of the series.Characters (7/10):For the characters, I'll start with Mina since she's the one the series opens with. As the queen of vampires, Mina acts very much like one would expect from someone of noble birth. She's haughty, aggressive, cocky and arrogant, and not above looking down on others. She's also very shameless, having no problem with others seeing her naked regardless of what form she's currently in. Even so, she does have a softer side too, though she generally only shows it in front of certain people, particularly Akira. Even so, while she's far from being one-dimensional, I overall found her to pretty underdeveloped, especially in terms of backstory, as her relationship with the main villains is never explored in detail, nor is it ever explained why she chose now of all times to reveal the existence of vampires to the world and create the Bund. She also has a tendency to fall into the unfortunate trap of ""I'm the protagonist, so every action I take is right while anyone who opposes me is wrong."", which looks especially bad given that she's definitely not above doing some shady things throughout the series. None of these problems were enough to break her character for me, but as far as vampires go, I've definitely seen better.My personal favourite character is Akira Kaburagi Regendorf, from whose viewpoint we primarily see the series from despite it being ultimately Mina's story. Introduced as someone who can't remember anything about himself other than his name, Akira has grown to believe that he's just an ordinary teenager. However, upon meeting (or rather reuniting with) Mina, he learns that he is actually a werewolf and Mina's chosen guardian, and that he made a promise to Mina some time before the series began. As the show goes on, Akira remembers more and more about himself and his history with Mina, and slowly figures out just what she means to him, which makes for a pretty decent character arc, if not a particularly original one. Personality-wise, he's generally a kind person, especially compared to Mina, showing his kind side to the majority of people he interacts with rather than just a select few, though he can be ruthless and definitely isn't above killing when necessary. As a matter of fact, he ends up being the main focus of the last few episodes, during which Mina has been relegated to something of a damsel-in-distress role, which only further cemented which one I liked more.Rounding up the main cast is Yuki Saegusa, a human girl who took care of Akira during the time he had amnesia. And when I say ""human"", I mean she's completely normal, with no dark secrets or supernatural powers to speak of. While this does allow her to serve as a decent surrogate for the audience, it also means that she can't contribute all that much during fights, and so is always forced to the sidelines. Her main role in the series is to allow us to look at the world of vampires and werewolves through a human lens. Personality-wise, she's quite likeable, being very kind and, while initially being scared of vampires, coming to realise they're not so bad through interactions with Mina, and helps to humanise both her and Akira. Even so, it is disappointing that she isn't given much to do over the series. Aside from the main trio, there's a fairly large supporting cast, including Mina's entourage, Akira's fellow werewolves and other characters that are best left unmentioned. Unfortunately, the series being only 12 episodes long means there's only so much time for these characters to be developed, and ultimately almost none of them, the main cast included, are given a proper narrative conclusion.Enjoyment (7/10):When watching a gothic horror series, there are two things that the audience can expect; bloody action scenes and a grimdark atmosphere, and ""Dance in the Vampire Bund"" has both of those in spades. It also tackles some really sensitive subjects, up to and including sexual extortion. However, while their is a ton of horror and violence, the series also contains plenty of lighter moments too, particularly in almost any scene between Akira and Mina. Even so, the series maintains an ultra-serious atmosphere throughout, with the moments of comic relief being few and far between.Overall:""Dance in the Vampire Bund"" is yet another example of an anime that could have been so much more than it is, which probably isn't helped by the fact that it only covers a small part of the manga it's based off. It has a good concept, decent action scenes and some great visuals, music and voice acting, but these are sadly held back by a cliché ridden story and interesting but underdeveloped characters. It's worth a look if you're a vampire fan, but even then you're probably better off watching ""Hellsing Ultimate"" or ""Seraph of the End"" instead.Score:6+8.5+8.5+7+7=37/50=7.4/10"
Shoushimin Series,"THIS IS A SPOILER-FREE REVIEWHonobu Yonezawa is not just my favourite japanese author, but one of my favourite authors in general. His amazing “Koten-bu” series (Also known as “Hyouka”) drew me in with it´s small scale mysteries, great characters and the overall atmosphere. This season, another famous work of his got an anime adaptation and from the outside it looked like this show will follow up in Koten-bu´s footsteps. But did it deliver?Story – 6/10This is eerily similar to Hyouka and it hurts this show a lot. The setting, the characters, the pacing, the structure and everything else feels like another version of something he...has already done. You just cannot stop comparing the two with each other and unfortunately, Shoushimin is far inferior to it´s predecessor. The little mysteries are constructed with similar effort, but the writing as a whole has taken a step back. It just feels a little bit bland and unrefined. The cases do not get enough explanation and some of them leave questions unanswered. This probably happened during the transition from novel to anime, which is a process that is very hard to do, especially in a genre like mystery, where every little remark or sentence can be of extreme importance. The show starts pretty slow and takes a long time to get going. I also think that there are some issues with the tone of the series. In one episode, our main characters sit at a table and eat cake, and the next episode someone almost gets killed with a knife. If you do not commit to one of these directions seriously, they both just feel out of place.I know comparing this show to something as beautiful as “Hyouka” is not really fair, but even without doing it, this show has some glaring faults.Art – 8/10The art is actually really good. They did this very interesting thing with the aspect ratio, giving the whole show a more cinematic feel. The close-ups are beautiful and the show is constantly experimenting with the camera and the surroundings. They also did this cool thing where our main protagonist envisions himself as the culprit, so he follows their steps himself and even wears their clothes. Nothing here is quite as outstanding though, and most of that is because the relatively small  and inexperienced Studio Lapin Track lacks the insane amount of outstanding creativity that Kyoto Animation did. This is still their best work so far, so there is definitely an upswing!Sound – 7/10The OP/ED combination fits the show extremely well. I actually think this might be the only time this show out-trumps Hyouka, if even by a small margin. They are animated fantastically and set a perfect tone for the show itself, especially the ED. The BGM however does not hold up as well. A lot of the important scenes lack music, and the show does not have these one or two outstanding little tracks that play during the mysteries.Characters – 7/10This is a hard category to rank. First, let´s talk about our main Character, Kobato. i really, really did not like him. His backstory didn´t really speak to me, the way he acts is super unrelatable and i think he is a huge step-down from Oreki from Hyouka. There is room for development so I won´t write him of completely but so far, he really missed his mark.The same can not be said about his friend, Osanai. She was actually really damn interesting. I always love it when there are characters that don´t seem to fit into one of the established character archetypes that have existed for a long time in the anime community. Osanai is mostly a big mystery, but when the show finally delved deeper into her intentions and she reveals her true demeanour, it gets really interesting. She alone might be the reason for me to come back to this show once season two arrives. Other than that, the side characters were alright. Doujima is always nice when he is on screen, but he did not receive that much development so far. The “villains” were absolutely comedic and could not be taken seriously. This also has to do with the insane tone-shifts that this show goes through during it´s climax.Enjoyment – 7/10I definitely see potential here. I just love these kinds of small-scale mysteries to much and it is always a treat when a show piques your curiosity, even just a little bit. Season two has already been announced, and I am willing to give this series a second chance to fully win me over. I really want to love this show…- Marco_YoooFINAL SCORE - 7/10"
Hanamonogatari,"You may think that my 8/10 is a bit high for Hanamonogatari (and I think so too), but the series still holds its own. Kanbaru may not be as interesting a character to explore as the main cast of the series, but the show takes her perspective with her old classmate to let the viewers know more about her personality and her growth after Bakemonogatari and when Araragi and Senjougahara go to college. In short, even though it is a TV special with only five episodes, it still holds the core of the Monogatari series and is no less than the previous seasons, at least...for me."
Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai? Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen,"For context I gave season one a 9/10, I loved it, hilarious stuff. But there is only so much non-progression I can take. Yes, it continues to have some very funny moments, but from the first ep to the last, we don't move an inch plot wise. So then I have to ask myself, why am I watching?They do try to give a bit more depth and backstory so some of the side student council members, but this actually was even less enjoyable to watch as it had even less to do with the main romance plot. It's like they'll show us anything BUT main...plot progression.Will I watch season 3? Yes. But thats because I'm unemployed at the moment. Should you? If you like plot progression, probably not.Unless you're also unemployed."
Kanokon,"Its the story of a shota named Kouta who is lusted after by two yokai.A horny well-endowed goudere fox spirit. And a lolita kuudere wolf spirit.Most of the anime revolves around hijinks and fanservice as these two girls do everything they can to make him theirs...even if it kills him.Both girls are insane, and always pussyblocking each other. And Kouta understands you should never stick your dick in crazy.But they are funny and entertaining.Do not go into this expecting some kind of deep plot. This is primarily ecchi. The selling point is seeing these two girls naked."
Shinseiki Evangelion,"Neon Genesis: Evangelion (NGE/Eva/Shinseiki) starts as a rather interesting mecha anime, it being unlike most others. Only young teens can operate the super-strong, impressive, and stunning mega-robots called Evangelions (Eva) in the fight against Angels, the bizarre mighty creatures attacking Earth. The beginning contains unique and interesting elements that give NGE the potential to be an amazing anime.Sadly, the creators chose for it to be horrible. In almost every episode some more intriguing plot is introduced, often by arbitrarily throwing in some vague concepts without further explanation. This would've been fine if any of these plot threads/concepts were ever explained. Instead, the show just moves...on to the next episode, introducing some more confusion without ever answering any of the questions the viewer may have.Somewhere halfway the mecha anime spirals into some experimental post-modernistic atrocity, of course, one of the defining properties of post-modernism is believing that knowledge is not certain or objective, often pushing seeming standards we have established as the human race. This CAN be very cool, like with the design of the Angels. However, the creators also decided to push the definition of good storytelling and character writing. Watching NGE is like reading a book with 10 chapters of which chapters 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 are ripped out, which is definitely NOT cool. There's a tipping point in the show after which in every episode you will think to yourself: ""How did we get here???"". They'll introduce certain plans or events which seem very important and defining for the show, the climax even you could say. They'll then state that there exists a set of steps required to execute/reach these plans or events.  They'll however not mention what any of these steps are, and then suddenly, plan/event X has happened, no buildup, no climax, it has just happened. How? An epic fight? No. It just happened.For what is supposedly a mecha anime the fight scenes are nothing special, they're also short and quite sparse. If you're looking for action, you won't find it here.The characters are infuriating, they do not act as normal human beings, and for most people, in order to be able to connect on an emotional level with a character, one must first recognize these characters as valid humans. The characters in NGE are just too unbelievable, there is no way people like these could exist in real life, and if they did, you'd want them to perish. All the main characters have severe parental issues as if the writer couldn't possibly imagine a person not having any. And they're so emotionally incompetent you want to beat some sense into them. They undergo very little character progression, and thus become stale very quickly, turning into a huge frustration. Witnessing certain characters doing the same infuriating shit over and over again gets old really fast. Some of the characters are portrayed as just being the issues they have, rather than also being human.As the anime progresses it becomes noticeable that money was running out; certain scenes are repeated up to 5 times, consecutively, especially towards the end, where it'll just be a text appearing for .5 seconds, followed by a character philosophizing, on repeat. Some call this a genius piece of art outing the philosophy known as post-modernism, to many it will feel like what it is, money ran out, and they had to make something that looks like one's DVD player repeating because of a scratch on the disc.The ending is arguably the worst part of NGE, some people argue it's amazing for being so abstract, complicated, and philosophizing about complex human emotions and thoughts. To me, it is just a horribly failed experiment, dramatizing and exaggerating basic human thoughts that are poorly processed by unrealistically incompetent people.NGE is a mecha anime on one end, and a philosophical/psychological anime on the other. It failed on both ends. Regardless of the impressive piece of art some people consider it to be, it is simply not entertaining, which is what anime is supposed to be.If you love banana taped-to-the-wall art for the deep meaning behind it, you'll love this anime, if you don't, I advise you to stay away from it.On another note, the animation quality is fine, and the audio is really good, when watching this anime I can really recommend doing so in 5.1 surround.Animation: 7Sound: 9Characters: 1Story: 2"
18if,"Dreamy Teen Safe Girls In DreamsVisual it's a mixed bag, It reminds me of early 2000 show with the coloring, It's just way too bright and digital. And the characters design look a little bootleg at some point.directions all over the place, I could really feel that there was a different director on every episode, like every story it feels so all over the place.Some episodes love stories, some extremely bloody body horror, it just doesn't have a consistent voice. Some episodes are okay some boring, That's what you get out of this format but most of them are okay but, only bearable okay.It...feels like in the between episode stuff happens, that would be nice to know,  like oh I already know this person in episode three and it's just like what what is happening what's going on?I have seen shows where this kind of very different episodic stuff work like, space dandy  but this one just lacks the character to care about it is not fun characters, They are just kind of bland . I would not want to meet them in real life.Missed pretential just not fun to watch."
Romantic Killer,"I have been watching anime for 15 years (how am I 30 already? No regrets though, 30 years well spent so far), with an emphasis on isekai and romance. I'm not going to say I'm infallible, but I have an opinion on this one. There is a lot to like, but also things I disagree with. It is a classic dating sim format with love interests that have surprisingly fine backgrounds. It takes a bit for those backgrounds to be realized, so be a bit patient. My qualms with the series begin with the main character being relatively unlikable in the beginning, which takes me...out of the emersion because why should anyone give this lame violent person the time of day. In the end though, we find that it wasn't just plot convenience, but circumstance that would lead these people to give the protagonist the time of day, so it is forgivable enough. I would have rated this a solid 7 because I think that is what it realistically deserves. That being said, I gave it a 6 because midway through there was a lame ""joke"" about a cat pee soaked mattress that the anime pushed like it was some amazing joke from above to be laughed at by all. In reality, I found the joke irredeemable and dropped it a star for pushing it harder that was socially acceptable. If this sounds like a rant by a drunken 30 year old, I won't say that is inaccurate, but I watched that scene when I was sober and it was lame enough to stick with me this entire month. I wash my hands of it."
Sousou no Frieren,"If you like the snow in the winter, the way the environment sounds deadened and quiet, the way it's cozy inside and freezing outside, and you find a blizzard beautiful, watch this anime in the autumn/winter.I spent a winter in Minnesota, and that was my favorite part of the place. This anime really made me miss it greatly.If you just want to feel sentimental, watch this anime.I'm not saying much about the anime itself because it is excellent and I believe its impact of memes speaks for itself. Everybody should watch this anime at some point. However, if you love the snow,...and want to feel sentimental, watch this in the winter, and it is elevated. A magical experience.The characters are great. The pacing is relaxing, the sound design is excellent, and so is the music. It is almost Tolkien-esque in the sense you get of times gone by."
Himouto! Umaru-chan,"Umaruuun!I can't say enough how fun it is to watch this series. First of all, I want to thank AniOne Asia for uploading this series on YouTube for free.  I've been meaning to watch this series because of the OP. When I first watched it, man, I got hit by nostalgia because I hadn't heard that song for long and just realized that Umaru almost hit the 10th anniversary. Isn't that crazy?But anyway, let's get into the review.We are going to review the story/plot first. Actually no, there is no plot, of course. It's a f*cking Slice of Life Comedy, or people like to...call it a sitcom for some reason, but that's not the point. The point is that it's so joyful to watch this. As a grown-up who has a brother in university and a sister in high school, this is the most relatable series ever. I relate to Taihei, especially when he is with his annoying little sister like I am with my little sister.The characters as well, like omg. As annoying as Umaru is, I actually can handle her in her show. I guess it's because I have my own annoying sister, but it's just fun whenever she doesn't get what she wants and gets the punishment she deserves. Then whenever UMARUUN! happen, or she changes her appearance, it's like a completely different character. That in itself is one of the interesting things in the show. The fact that she can deceive people into thinking that she is two different people leads to some fun moments in the show. Heck, actually, she deceives even Shylpin with her 3rd persona, like it so fun to watch.Anyway, let's move on to the next one, the OST. Like I said, I've been meaning to watch it because of the OP, and I stand by it, it is so good. The fact that Umaru's voice actor sang this song with two voices reminded me of Ayunda Risu of Hololive Indonesia, even before Hololive was a thing. I love that attention to detail. Then the ED is also soooo good. I was actually so surprised to hear both Ebina and Kirie sing, like literally. I never thought these two cinnamon rolls, who are very shy, sing. Then, the foreshadowing on that ED just made me realize how dumb I was. This is not a spoiler I am just letting you know that the ED is actually the final episode of the 1st season. I'm not even joking. I never thought they would do that because most of the time, ED is just random sh*t thrown in there to ease your way for finishing the episode but not for Umaru, apparently.As of the regular OST, as in episode OST. I will say it again: I very much enjoy it as long as the OST and animation match the mood.Now, onto the animation review. I can't believe that I never noticed when I saw the OP that the one who animated this is Doga Kobo. Like, man, they are so talented to make SOL so much fun to watch. If you saw the completed series that I've watched, you can clearly see all of the Doga Kobo series that I've consumed. It's pretty much a lot. I like a lot of series produced by Doga Kobo, and it will grow bigger and bigger as I speedrun these animes that I need to catch up on.And last but not least, the VA. I've mentioned Umaru's VA in the OST section of the review, how about the other VA? Well, I can say that they are very good. I don't really have a complaint. Even as annoying as Umaru and Sylphin can be, they make it so I can watch them two chatting. It's like not super on top, where it becomes hard to watch. It's decent and it's bearable.Overall, I give this 7.8/10. If you like SOLCOM, this is the series that you have to watch. It's available for free on the AniOne Asia YouTube Channel."
Wo Neng Wuxian Dunwu,"We are bless once again with the same studio and producer of Hidden Sect Leader (Yin Shizong Men Zhang Jiao). This is a tough find. But the animation and it niche jokes delivery and on top of it same producer IQIYI is a dead giveaway that this is indeed the same studio. Why is it important? Well if you are a person of culture and you are here solely for a enjoyable Comedic Meme cultivation plot. This is it. Wo Neng Wuxian Dunwu or I Can Experience Limitless Enlightenments. This time instead of being a Hidden Sect Leader. Our protagonist instead is a cultivator disciple...and must complete a task given by our BASED ""system"". There is only 6 total ""good"" translation so far of the donghua show. And I cant wait for more. The animation quality and jokes delivery is on point as always.However there is only 1 cons. Just like Hidden Sect Leader. The translation is very hard to find. And translated version of this donghua show released very slow.The name of the studio is also in Chinese and I cant really find much more information about the studio other works. So me finding this donghua show made me cry tears of joy. As I cant wait for more works being released by this studio. Would recommend 10/10.Would also appreciate it if whoever you can find me the name of studio so I can look up more of their works."
Bakemonogatari,"This is such a phenomenal show, and I highly enjoyed my rewatch of it. The animation style is gorgeous with snappy dialogue and character interactions to match that tempo. It’s packed with cultural references and wordplay every minute. That’s the one part of the show I didn’t understand at all, but more props to you if you have the knowledge to pick up on it.You can’t get into the girls without spoiling details and all the arcs, but there are many very likable heroines in this show. Their feelings towards Araragi are believable. And the main girl herself,  Senjougahara, is the perfect choice...for him. This is one of the best harems around, and it wouldn’t surprising if it influenced many later anime.My main and only hang up is the specific… “fetish elements.”Fanservice itself is fine, but there are some very borderline moments that taint an otherwise great show. Araragi is a great protagonist, but jesus. These Diddy moments I’m talking about kind of ruin my view of him and the show’s more wholesome elements. But it’s better just ignored. I hate mentioning it, but it’s necessary to bring up for any wary of such things.Moving on from that dour note, Monogatari is a whole universe of winding shows and arcs to follow, but you can stop here if wanted. Bakemonogatori bookends its season very nicely and ties up most of its plot details. As a stand alone show, it also works well. I do intend to watch more."
Yofukashi no Uta,"This anime has just not got going for me personally. Like a majority of the animes that I have watched, I have never read the manga overall. I went into this anime blind as a bat, and my expectations were less than stellar. From episodes one to five, it felt like it was the same plot over and over again, Sure you get a character here and there for the plot but it feels like it is a very mundane story, that has the saving grace of an opening and ending songs doing more to make up for a lack of structure.When I read the...plot of Call of the Night, I thought it would be intense and have this result of character building. It falls flat like a three day Pepsi from a two liter bottle that someone forgot to put back in the fridge after a party. I am twelve episodes in and this anime is a solid five out of ten for me."
Watashi no Shiawase na Kekkon,"This anime feels like a typical Cinderella story but with strange powers that seem completely unnecessary. The inclusion of these powers caught me off guard and cheapened the overall experience, making the characters seem one-dimensional. Beyond the main character's trauma, she lacks any real personality, and there's nothing to make her stand out. While the animation and music are impressive, they can't fully redeem the weak plot. The story is unoriginal, and the characters have no depth, which made the experience frustrating. The music is the only thing that somewhat compensates for the lack of substance in the narrative and character development."
Sunohara-sou no Kanrinin-san,"If you’re into the whole shota/Onee-san dynamic, Miss Caretaker of Sunohara-sou might be worth checking out. It’s a pretty chill slice-of-life rom-com about Aki Shiina, a shy boy who moves to Tokyo and ends up living in a dorm run by Ayaka Sunohara, this super sweet and motherly older woman who basically spoils him rotten. Aki obviously develops a crush on her, and that dynamic is the heart of the show.The characters are what you’d expect from this kind of anime. Ayaka is the busty, caring, sisterly Onee-san who dotes on Aki like he’s her little brother (or more). Then there’s Nana, her younger, gyaru-like...sister who’s fun but not as over-the-top. You’ve also got Yuzu, the small, serious loli type; Yuri, the pervy yuri girl; and Sumire, who’s into feminine guys and takes a liking to Aki because of his cute feminine looks. Oh, and Nana’s friends are total shotacons but don’t really flirt with Aki—they’re more into teasing...a lot.The story is really basic, though. Each episode is like its own little sketch, usually focused on setting up funny or awkward moments. There’s a lot of humor about boob sizes (classic) and Aki trying to impress Ayaka with mixed results. There’s not much character development in the anime, so if you’re hoping for big moments or serious romance, this might feel slow. It’s more cute and playful than anything too serious or uncomfortable, especially with Aki crushing on Ayaka.The art is fine. It’s not the most detailed or amazing, but it fits the vibe—soft and cozy. Ayaka and Nana are definitely the standout designs (for obvious reasons), and overall, it doesn’t feel cheap. The animation does the job.When it comes to fanservice, it’s what I’d call “light ecchi.” There are plenty of suggestive moments, mostly involving Ayaka being, well, *very* close to Aki, but it doesn’t go too far. It’s more about teasing and playful vibes, so don’t expect anything over-the-top. Nana brings some fun energy with her teasing, too.Overall, it’s a decent, laid-back show. Nothing groundbreaking, but if you like the idea of an Onee-san spoiling a younger guy or just want a slice-of-life with some light ecchi moments, it’s worth a watch. It’s fun but doesn’t do anything super special."
Corpse Party: Tortured Souls - Bougyakusareta Tamashii no Jukyou,"Started watching this at 3 am and got done at 5, i regret nothing. It was very good, you should give it a goI did not know what would happen at any point, it really was surprising. Can't belive people sleep on this onei mean, it's a horry so they are all a bit dumb but they got smart hahai think if you like horror and gore then it's just the right fit for youThe animation itself was very good, it never got boring. But i did get some chills here and there, it's an interesting story and it's easy to follow. It's only...4 episodes but they made use of that, it was just enough"
Sora no Otoshimono,"Heaven's Lost Property is one of the most egregiously perverted anime of all time that should only be watched alone (unless you are lucky enough to have someone that can match your freak).  Every episode feels like a hentai writer was forced to write for an anime and begrudgingly did so.  The rules of the world the story presents are constantly ignored, sometimes within the same episode, in order to maximize the possible amount of scenes with mostly nude women (and the budget in which animate said mostly nude women).  I am genuinely concerned for the mental and physical health of the...prop artist of this series, as there are a minimum of 100 pairs of highly detailed woman's underwear shown throughout the series, with at least 45 of them requiring their own 30fps animations (from multiple angles).The show also has a lot of jokes (most of them hit) and some touching emotional scenes, but as a whole it is overshadowed by how horny on main it is.  I would highly recommend if you are looking for a really well animated "" I Can't Believe it's Not Hentai"" type show or are just looking for a extremely perverted show with some humor on the side.  Besides that, there isn't too much to gain from watching Heaven's Lost Property."
Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari Season 3,"I'll just say don't watch it, it's almost the same as the 2nd season 😴😴😴😴 only with good animation, the story moves fast and that makes it very predictable.The only good thing about this season was the fight with the dragon emperor.The 4th season was announced and it was confirmed that it will be the same director of the previous season.(3), if so, let's not expect it to be good.if only they would have adapted it with the same personality of the light novel.PS - better read the NL or the manga which is much better than the anime"
BanG Dream! It's MyGO!!!!!,"I’m not the kind of person that needs to pretend that everything they like is a masterpiece, somethings I like are good, but not perfect, others I have no problems admitting are just plain garbage. But Mygo? The fact that this anime doesn’t even get half the recognition it deserves drives me INSANEno anime has hit me since day one quite like this. Every single scene comes together like a beautiful tapestry, every line of dialogue, every symbolism, every camera angle, it’s woven so expertly, that I’m in pure awe that many of the decisions made weren’t pre-planned at all.The characters? So raw and...real, they’re messy, but not in the over theatrical way, they’re all just figuring out how to be teenagers, how to be human, and they can’t even call each other proper friends, but they understand each other. The mystery? (Because I fully consider this a mystery) incredible, I’m still geeking out about it, everytime I try to understand it it’s like I’m falling through the rabbit hole (in a good way), it’s not convoluted at all, and every piece of the puzzle just fits in a way that makes me want to bash my head against the wall and gift all of them therapy for Christmas. The music? I cried like a baby twice and plan to do more. It makes such incredibly creative directing choices, it doesn’t feel the need to explain everything through dialogues or monologues but just lets the story speak for itself, it’s, like, SUCH a funny show.I want to put everyone in a labyrinth an analyze their actions like a mad scientistConsidering how popular female lead band anime has become thanks to shows like bocchi, and with this year’s girls band cry, I have no idea how this hasn’t reached the top, maybe it’s because it’s attached to a pre-existing IP, but I feel like if it was another more popular genre, or if it had an audience of western male anime fans, it would get the 10 ir rightfully deservesIt all feels so natural and real, I’ve known these girls throughout all my life, and I loved them, and I hated them, and I was each and every one of these girls at one point, these girls know me and I know them. These girls hold me by the hand and tell me it’s ok to be lost, that I can go one, and I believe them."
Jarinko Chie (TV),"I watched this TV series because I enjoyed the movie and expected it to be a fuller treatment of the ideas seen there, like the pathos  of Chie being a tough girl who’s actually carrying the sadness of her separated parents and her deadbeat father leaving her to earn money by operating the family’s tiny grilled meat restaurant by herself.However, only a handful or less of the series’ episodes touch on these ideas, and all are within the first 15 episodes. The storyline about the separation of Chie’s parents reaches a conclusion surprisingly quickly and has surprisingly little effect on the series after....With Chie’s motivations neutralized, she’s reduced to playing straight-man to her father, Tetsu, whose antics as an overgrown juvenile delinquent takes over the series completely.Given the shift from comedy with occasional dramatic elements to complete comedy happened so soon, I would be happy to forget it if it became a notably strong comedy, but that’s not the case. It has its moments but nothing I’d care to watch a second time and it has a strangely relaxed pace where it will take multiple episodes to build up to a simple comedy idea like a neighborhood sumo tournament or a rugby match between police and local mischief makers. Sometimes the set piece scene is good when it finally gets there but I found myself wishing it’d just get to the point sooner. The final 10 or more episodes seem to slow down even more than that and I found myself finally getting impatient with the series. If I'd had more than a handful of episodes to go I may have dropped it.By the end I’d had more than enough. The movie left me eager to try this series, but this series has left me uninterested in watching the second TV series which is apparently more of the same."
Nekomonogatari: Kuro,"Short little mini season but it really is packed to the brim. We get some of the good aspects from Bakemonogatari back like the pacing and structure, and then also the quirkiness of Nisemonogatari kind of resulting in its own thing. Nice to finally see the events of Golden Week that had been referenced so much before, and its conclusion being a fitting end/beginning. Black Hanekawa is a good character and with the whole season revolving around her and Tsubasa it really gave that chance to shine, final episode being my favorite. Overall I enjoyed this and am already getting into Nekomonogatari White."
FLCL Alternative,"You know those, like, sequels to shows that nobody asked for and it ends up sucking and we're like ""great, thanks, Big Corpo""This is thatIn the first seven minutes or so, the main girl pulls out a Jenga block that says ""Never Knows Best"" and I think that's a perfect representation of this series (as in Alternative, not FLCL as a whole).It pulls stuff from FLCL OG just because Adult Swim really really liked FLCL OG back in the day. Haruko is back because people liked her in FLCL OG. She fights with a guitar because FLCL OG. Never Knows Best, LAST DINOSAUR, hell, The...Pillows' involvement in general (I'm genuinely surprised they never used Ride On, Shooting Star but for what it's worth, I did like the new ED song. It's not as good as Ride On but it's solid), it's all to service the masterpiece before it. In the last episode at the end, we even see a blink-and-you'll-miss-it clip from FLCL OG.It feels cheap and pandering. I love love love LAST DINOSAUR but I was actively dreading it being played by the time it did because I didn't want them to trot it out so FLCL OG fans could clap and point at the thing they know.FLCL OG was a lightning bolt you couldn't help but catch with your hands and Alternative does not have that same aura.This is the corporate-mandated belated sequel that can't let go of the thing that people loved.Other than Haruko, the only really notable characters are the 4 girls in the main friend group.They're just ~so quirky~, the first episode just shows them goofing off and building a bottle rocket because ~adolescence~ and it just felt artificial to me. We do sort of get an episode to show off each character but I never got attached to any of them. Kana (the main girl) is mentioned to have been sickly as a child a couple of times but it just kind of feels shoved in. It feels like I genuinely know almost nothing about Pets except her family is rich and she likes taking pictures with her friends, I guess? There's also The Pretty One and The Fat One (who, to be fair, does get some good character development at least, she works really hard and has a goal for her future) and, like, who caresKana's not as interesting a protagonist as Naota, none of the side characters are as interesting as Samejima, the animation isn't as off-the-wall as the original, it's Adult Swim going ""hey, we liked FLCL back in the day, let's do it again, we've got money!""Which is weird when in this very show, they're going ""oh, nothing lasts forever, even precious things will disappear"".Let the past die. If you want to use your Adult Swim money to make new shows, that's fine, but digging up the corpse of FLCL is not the way to do it.Alternative feels like if you ripped the soul out of FLCL OG. The only reason I gave it a 3 is because the production still looks pretty good and tbh, I'm hedging my bets that Progressive and Grunge are even worse because apparently Alternative is supposed to be the BEST FLCL sequel (although I've genuinely heard nothing about Shoegaze so that'll be a surprise for me).Jury's out on if it's better than Progressive/Grunge/Shoegaze in my eyes but if that's true, you're better off acting like these shows don't exist."
Tokidoki Bosotto Russia-go de Dereru Tonari no Alya-san,"THIS IS A SPOILER-FREE REVIEWEvery once in a while you open Twitter (or any other social media app), just to be bombarded with a sheer endless stream of pictures of this new trending anime girl. After the absolute dominance of Marin Kitagawa in 2022, it seems to happen every single season. So, out of curiosity, and because I was in the mood for a rom-com, i decided to give “Roshidere” a chance. So, what sets this show apart from the rest of it´s genre?Story – 7/10The main hook of this story is without a doubt the russian bits. The language is used sparely and either...serves for comedic or romantic effect. I really liked the whole concept, but in it´s core, it really is just a fun and cute gimmick and nothing more. However, i actually think the story can stand on it´s own pretty well. What kept me coming back was not the main heroine, Alisa, but rather the circumstances of our main protagonist. There is a certain mystery about him and his family that gets introduced and slowly developed over the course of the series. Not the deepest plotline, but it is enough to give the actions of him and his sister more meaning. The main plotline, which mostly centres around student council politics is intertwined with some pure romance episodes here and there that help to lighten things up a bit. There is definitely potential for some drama in the future, and I am eager to see where the story goes next.Art – 8/10This is a beautiful show. I absolutely love the bubbly artstyle of these kinds of romance shows. Studio Doga Kobo is slowly making a name for themselves after delivering the outstanding “Oshi no Ko” last year, I would love to see them make something like a fantasy show, their style would really fit something like that! Other than that, the animation is just really good overall, especially the Opening and the 12(!) different endings.Sound – 8/10Actually my favourite category here. My god, the EDs of this show just go absolutely crazy. Every episode gets it´s own ending and they are all sung by Alisa´s voice actor, Sumire Uesaka. That is some serious dedication right here! Some of the songs took me by complete surprise: The LEGENDARY “Hare Hare Yukai” was brought back almost 20 Years after it´s first appearance. Other popular songs like  “Kawaikute Gomen” (Which is an instant classic-banger of a song) are used perfectly and fit Alisa soooo well. Outstanding job here!Characters – 7/10Our main heroine Alisa is of course the cover girl of this show, and I really enjoyed her a lot. The other girls were also great, with Masha being my favourite. Alisa´s character arc, while not being the most unique is pretty compelling, and there is a certain mystery lingering around Mashas past that I really want to see more of. But what truly puts this category forward your average Rom-com are the family dynamics of our main protagonist. There is a lot to unravel here, but I thought they did a great job at setting up for future seasons. If this show decides to shift the focus to that for a while, season two (which is already in the works) will surely be even better!Enjoyment – 7/10Checking out the rom-com of the season is always pleasant. This is definitely not my genre of choice because i´d rather have something more serious with emphasis on storytelling (sci-fi, fantasy, etc) or just a full-on ecchi show. But shows like these make me come back to it on a regular basis and i will definitely watch season two. So for now, lets wait till the next anime girl breaks the anime community!- Marco_YoooFINAL SCORE - 7/10"
Higashi no Eden,"As one of the more intriguing premises in anime to date, Eden of The East, though stumbling periodically, delivers on the initial hook and ultimately lands on its feet. Many great ideas and unique concepts were explored, engaging the viewer by consistently posing questions to develop the narrative. However, there were also many odd writing decisions that, while not ruining the enjoyment, would leave the audience wondering why they were implemented. Nonetheless, the well-executed scenes, character interactions, and chemistry between the main cast gave an overall positive impression. Despite some hindrances, it is worth giving this a chance if you are interested in the synopsis."
Kami no Tou: Koubou-sen,"The first and second episodes were promising, but the further along, the more this anime becomes not the ""Tower of God"" that most fans loved, but some kind of ""Tower of God parody"". I don't know who wrote the anime script, but that person should quit his/her job - the 2nd season is completely pointless. Endless dialogues about nothing. There are no fight scenes. Amateur-level animation. Pokemons are more interesting, because at least they are fighting, lol. The 2nd season of ""Tower of God"" is a big disappointment. It would be better if they hadn't even created it.. The art style is not fitting for...the story. No one will enjoy this season."
Death Parade,"Unique concept, a simple creative premise that fails when it attempts to suddently make itself complex and larger than life (no pun intended).Is the true human nature revealed in the depths of the hardest moral challenges?Death Parade would say so. I was entertained throughout and even moved in certain episodes as they reflect true human qualms.To be honest the importance or arbitrers was not sufficiently explained for me, but the fact that non human judges human was most utterly interesting.A lot of episodes have to do with justification and moral decision-making which is made for people interested in psychology and philosophy."
Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de,"I found this title buried in my watch-list and dove right in without looking it up. And binged it in one go.As others have already pointed out: if you're looking for epic clashes between super heroes, look elsewhere. This is a standard school life harem and the whole magic thing exists mainly as reason for some parts of the plot to happen.It is overall light-hearted, cute and funny. However, it does play the ""more serious"" card here and there with characters dealing with their anxieties or breakdowns as well as in the very scarce moments addressing the supernatural background plot.While the heroines are quite stereotypical,...I wouldn't call them bland or shallow. They all have their moments. Two of them clearly get more developpement than the others but it doesn't feel like a big problem when looking back.Now for protag-kun, forget the usual shy loser finding himself in all kinds of involuntary groping situations, he's actually kind of awesome in his own way and doesn't seem to give much thought to the horny stuff. In fact, you could probably remove the romantic feelings and still end up with a nice story about friendships. Tomoyo's secrets would still work the same. The impressive ""WAKANAI"" speech would still hit home. Kudos to her jp VA for such a powerful delivery. (The dubbed version of this scene falls short to be honest. She sounds like a teen shouting at her parents because she got grounded.)On the production side, I don't have any critics to formulate: the animation is fine, the musics and FX work well and help set the mood.When it comes to the supernatural part of the show, it is actually kind of frustrating that we don't get to see more of it but there is a reason for it in this story so it's... acceptable. But I'd say this first season could be a very cute introduction to a second part focusing on the whole other side. Too bad it's not the case."
Ooi! Tonbo 2nd Season,"Are you looking for the best sports anime in 2024? This anime is the answer..The reason: because I, who don't know about golf and its rules, still enjoy the anime since the 1st season of the anime. The 1st season might have some shortcomings because Tonbo is still a junior high school teenager, but the 2nd season ""chef kiss""I was made to laugh and scream with joy many times watching this anime, the character of Tonbo is really a character that comes out of the box.From the music, animation, and story is very interesting. Sometimes the drama makes us excited, sometimes we will be sad....For this 2nd season, the focus of the story is not only telling about Tonbo, But some characters will also be introduced and the portion is good. The character development is also all interesting. I just watched episode 8, but I'm sure I will watch the anime again if it's complete."
Yowamushi Pedal: New Generation,"The end of Season 2 was a very natural end to the story as a whole. It didn’t really need to continue but I was on board for continuing the story provided that they fix the issues with the story. They didn’t, in fact they made it worse. Despite a very weakly written protagonist, the whole of Yowamushi Pedal is held together by the fact that the Sohoku team is a group of relatable average joes while all of their rivals are overconfident jerks who push them to be better. That is completely lost in this third season. Not only have they not developed Onoda’s...character (he really needs to calm down and stop freaking out at every little thing) but they added a literal narcissistic idiot to the team which hurts the overall development of the main characters because they are forced to compensate for him. Plus the writing of the rivals has gotten worse with Hakone acting as if they are god given talents and guaranteed winners despite losing last season. For this franchise to survive long term, it needed to have completely reset itself post Season 2, wrote out all existing characters and started fresh."
Kami no Tou: Koubou-sen,"Yeesh. I’ve watched through episode 8, the writing is really rough, and the story is convoluted as hell. The Tower of God anime has been plagued by these issues in Season 1 and Season 2 Part 1, but my god, it’s exhausting in Season 2 Part 2.Also, the character development that was barely present in Season 2 Part 1 is virtually nonexistent here. As an audience, we have little to no stake in anything that any of our characters do or say. They’re all virtually interchangeable, even the Season 1 returning characters. Add on to that that the motivations for any character seems to...flip flop every other episode (or mid-episode), and new characters with likewise unclear/shifting motivations keep springing up…I’m probably going to finish out the last few episodes when they’re released for the hell of it, but given these issues on top of the loss of Season 1’s great animation and unique art style, TOG Season 2 overall is a wet fart… Is the writing in the manhwa this awful?"
Ojisan to Marshmallow,"No idea what I just watched but I think I liked it!Once in a blue moon the Crunchyroll site recommends something I haven't already seen.The episodes were short, something like 3 minutes but they managed to fit in just enough things in one episode to feel like I was watching something that was progressing. Even tho the point of this show is definitely not to present a linear (or even coherent) storyline.I like how the characters are written, but I didn't like how they were designed. The art style is shit.  And the whole production quality is quite low so visually nothing...to get excited about.I have no idea who this show is aimed at?! It has ecchi qualities so I was thinking this was aimed at young adults maybe? But then again the whole scheme looks and feels like a bit too childish at the same time. Don't know, it was confusing."
Re:Monster,"Just a heads up, this anime does have sex slaves in like the first episode, and later episodes have squeamish IMO pregnancy plots, so if that gives you the heebie jeebies, letting you know right now Re:Monster is not worth pushing past your boundaries.This is really bad, but let's talk about the good first.Definitely succeeds in being a power fantasy, which NGL, I did find some satisfaction in. It is nice to see the hero win and be cool all the time, even if it is immature.Sometimes, the show is funny. My favorite character was probably the fujoshi goblin. She was great.The...animation is a lot more brutal than I expected. Not like, super gore heavy, but they're not afraid of blood and flesh for the most part, which is interesting. There were some moments of slightly unique animation.The bad:The whole cast kind of sucks. There's so many characters and none of them have time to really do anything. Characters keep joining Protagkun's army for like no reason, and stay when they really don't have any reason too--particularly the members that were kidnapped by the gang, where the rest of their group was killed. Ogrekichi/the big dude who gets almost an arc about how much he wants to beat Protag-kun. But nothing really comes from that. Protag-kun whose name I already forgot was boring despite almost having an interesting backstory. He is more morally grey than he'd like to admit, especially in regards to how he treats women, which couldve been interesting but no one challenges him on that ever.SPEAKING OF THE WOMEN!Yeah they're not great. Everyone in this anime has less personality than the pebbles I kick on the road. But the female characters, particularly the human women Protagkun kidnaps. The girls are just, so fine with being kidnapped after Protagkun calmly assures them that they won't be raped. Sure, let's trust the leader goblin of the squad that just kidnapped us. Yes, protagkun did beat up the Bad Goblins who were going to rape them, but he's still a member of the kidnapping party. Maybe if these women were coming from significantly worse backgrounds I could believe it, but they were just wandering merchants. ALSO ALL THEIR MEN WERE KILLED! BY THE SAME GOBLINS!Also the human women Protagkun ""takes in"" don't get their names revealed until the end of the series and for a really horrific reason. So there's that.The monster women are kind of ok. Save for one, they aren't apart of the haremn so they get saved from that. But again everyone has the less personality than the dead wasp on my windowsill, so they really don't get much.There are some cool-ish moments with the worldbuilding, particularly the evolve system, but it just feels like kind of ominous sometimes and nothing interesting happens from it. I feel like you could've done something cool with the game mechanic systems in a world that isn't explicitly from a videogame, but nothing really cool happens with this either.Unless you just really love power fantasy isekai and can get over the sexism, hard skip."
Mo Dao Zu Shi,"Loved it!! Typical masterpiece from my darling Mo Xiang Tong Xiu, I hope to see more of her masterpieces released soon. Another anime to my favourites!The anime had me rushing to the manga and oh, it was spicy ;)Shame that chinese restrictions don't allow romance between two ppl of the same gender in the anime, Ik it'd be heart throbbing.I actually really liked the character's designs, especially Hanguan Jun hehe, and their personalities complimented their overall appearances very well. The anime watch order and plot is a little confusing but overall it really alluded me into the story line. I'm not gonna lie, I did...have trouble keeping up with names and which parts were in the present but besides that everything else was phenomenal -- in my opinion ofc.I'd definitely recommend this anime if you like BL or ,ehem, attractive men with long hair. You gotta watch this icl.I've rewatched this many times and every time I still get excited at particular scenes, and seeing handsome Lan Wangji AAAAAAH <333"
Kimi wa Houkago Insomnia,"A Review of the Best Romance Anime(and Manga)The title of the review isn’t exactly hyperbole, although there is definitely a mix of bias in my review but I genuinely believe the show is easily the best romance anime of at least the last decade or so…Here is a spoiler-free(ish) review of prolly my fave comfort anime(and manga). There will be mild spoilers in some section but as a whole, I don’t think the spoilers would deter one’s enjoyment of the story as there is no mind blowing plot points to worry about.(Just a little disclaimer: Whenever I would be referring Ganta and Isaki(show’s main lead),...I would describe them as “night owls” because…why not? They are insomniacs too…lol)Insomniacs After School is one of the most kindest and wholesome stories out there that touches right at the audience’s heart with a great and lovably cast of characters, primarily Ganta and Isaki, the two main characters stands out obviously. Both of them suffers from Insomnia’s and fall in love with each other. Simple enough, right? Yeah but Show’s simplicity is its greatest strength as the anime exceedingly executes the story’s simplicity to downright perfection without rushing the story even the slightest bit. No moments feels rushed and every moment between our two lovey dovey night owls dorks are handled with such care.Plot isn’t something extra spectacular or neither revolutionary. The plot contains many commonly known tropes to the genre. And yet the plot is powerful to produce moments of emotional depth so perfectly. Plot primarily contains Ganta and Isaki travelling, sometimes alone and sometimes with their (awesome) group of friends. These little trips are goddamn…beautiful. The story is extremely character driven by our two night owls which makes the trips extra special.Characters are easily the story’s biggest strength. The side cast is great, they have their own unique personalities. They aren’t inherently interesting in traditional sense and almost everyone is supportive of the night owls . Their chemistry with the main cast is what imo makes them special. The two adults(the nurse and Shiromaru) are important…Now in the anime, they are narratively important. Shiromaru taught Ganta photopgraphy(or astrophotography to be specific) and the Nurse teacher(Kurashiki iirc) gave them the permission to open Astronomy Club. In the manga(especially in the ending part), they have a huge role to play or an important lesson to teach Ganta…(I will restrict myself from talking about manga contents entirely lol).Now as a whole, Cast is unique and have great chemistry among themselves and the night owls. But the two magnum opuses of the character writing are- Ganta and Isaki.The chemistry between them is…eloquent(idk why am I using so many fancy words lol). The romance between them doesn’t seem forced, they are two people who met each other by a small accident, discovered they have a similar problem and then…well…became lovers. Story never suffers from weird pacing issues and develops the story perfectly to cook . Their progress in their relationship and character development is just pure gold.A bit dive deeper into the Night owls(It contains spoilers )-Ganta  got his insomnia from his fear…a fear of losing the ones he loves. Whenever he attaches himself to anyone, they disappear from his life. This is where he develops his unhealthy habit of self loathing and self hatred. He is naïve, he is flawed. His parents got separated as one morning, he never saw his mom. A fear that tomorrow will be worse than today. Self blame and Self guilt is something which is common in many kids who experience their parents getting separated or grew up in a household with toxic environment. Ganta was unfortunate to grow in such a similar environment. He planned the meteor watching party and got ruined by rain is one of the first examples of his self loathing we see in the story and his naivety.Isaki was born with a heart condition. A lthough, when the events of the story(both in the anime and manga) starts, she is far from danger but she has fear. A fear of facing the future. A fear of being left behind. She was treated as special due to her condition and she hated her. Everyone treated her like a burden. She too is flawed…her sister is the only person who treated her as a normal person.Photography is an important plot point. Ganta yearns for the past. He wants to go back to how things were simple back then when his family was happy and not separated. Isaki fears future, the future where she would be left behind, a future which she may not even be able to face…but photography is something which teaches them how to live in present properly. They can treasure their memories together. Its such a beautiful concept executed so perfectly in both the mediums.I am a lil hesitant to deep dive more as I am undoubtedly gonna divert myself to the “manga territory” as manga still has 70 ish chapter more worth of content filled with equally(if not greater) highs.This also leads me to another point as to how beautifully both influence each other. They teach other, they cure each other’s insomnia(not permanently ofcourse), they teach other how to live and care, they understand each other and how both develops wonderfully when you juxtapose it with the beginning of the story. Now, here is a lil fact(you can consider it a spoiler but I don’t think it’s a huge thing). There are a grand total of 2 kisses in the manga(out of which one is covered in the anime and the other one is a double page spread of their silhouettes). There is no sex as expected. But the story still feels intimate. Them sleeping together for the first time or the one time(during their picnic) or them holding hands in the ending. They are moments of intimacy that adds more depth. The execution of these scenes are just so sweet that I would argue it is even better than them having sex together to describe their intimate relationship…yeah.The Comedy and the overall tonal awareness and atmosphere is great. The show perfectly masters the late night vibes of the sky, their trips and its beautiful. The soundtrack elevates the overall tone. Show contains a good amount of comedy(some can be a rather clichéd comedy) but they are honestly fine. I feel 8/10 times the comedy hits right perfectly and even in the remaining 2 times, the comic scene doesn’t feel “off” or ruins the overall atmosphere, comedic scenes always take place during the light hearted moments and doesn’t feel jarring or tonally off even if the jokes may not land perfectly.The soundtrack is great. The OP and ED are rock solid(and I am even listening to ED while writing this review lol). Soundtrack never really falters the excitement and the voice acting is really on point.Now is Animation which well…uhh let’s say is the weakest part of the show. No No, The animation isn’t terrible but seldomly inconsistent. There are some clunky and choppy frames and editing which feels weird . Although, they do manage to perfectly capture the feeling and vibes of the everlasting Night sky which has its own importance in the story and makes the night owls night time vibes and meetings alongside their trips even more memorable.The ending is somewhat a lil divergent from the manga in a sense it feels more as a stand alone and a lil too “definite” one may say. But the ending doesn’t have any falters and is perfectly executed at a very beautiful moment, like really beautiful. Only one could hope for the Second Season. Just give us the goddamn Second Season…This wraps up the review. I am a lil afraid didn’t deep dive into the story more.(I would be restricting myself to do that and mostly will do it when I will write a review on the manga). The story is genuinely heartfelt, kind and wholesome. Its handled with such a brilliant care and all the themes and characters are lovable, real and in many ways relatable. Just Watch the Anime for god’s sake. And It deserves a higher rating for god’s sake. I cant expect something like Erased or Demon Slayer is rated higher than this…."
Ookami to Koushinryou: Merchant Meets the Wise Wolf,"The first thing that popped into my head when I saw this is ""why?"".There was absolutely no need to remake this anime, as we already have the 2008 rendition, which still stands the test of time to this day. The art and design is beautiful, the animation is great, and since this is not some edgy action anime, frame rate and CGI doesn't play here. The VO and localization team is the same as well, and bring about the same quality.What [b]did[/b] change is the characters themselves. In the original, Holo is a dignified albeit fickle goddess with surprising bouts of vulnerability hiding under...her austere and beguiling nature. While Lawrence is an experienced and shrewd merchant who wouldn't take her shit, but is also mesmerized by her often playful nature and incredible insight. Holo is intrigued as to how Lawrence could treat her as an equal and wouldn't just succumb to her godlike power and feminine charm, and Lawrence's empathy and compassion instinctively wants to protect the fragile heart hiding in her hard shell of animalistic pride and ancient wisdom. It's this delicate power dynamic that makes their relationship so interesting and fun.In this new version, however, everything goes out the window. Holo is presented as an angsty, hormonal teenager throwing tantrums, while Lawrence comes off as a total pushover. Gone is the amazing banter, the masterfully crafted back-and-forth between the unstoppable force and the immovable object. The depth and charm of their characters are replaced by awful caricatures. Holo the unstable tsundere and Lawrence the simp. Even the upgrade in art and animation doesn't trade for killing the soul of what made this anime great.My suggestion is, stick with the original 2008 rendition of Spice & Wolf."
Alien Stage,"this anime clearly has enormous potential, the characters in this story also have a good background and the story of this anime is unique which is a plus point of this anime.the artstyle of this anime is very beautiful and spoil the eyes, the graphics presented are also equally beautiful which makes the audience enjoy watching.the conflict that occurs in this story is also quite unique, raising the theme of aliens as evil creatures who abduct innocent humans, then our main characters try to find a way out of this hell. unique.in my opinion, maybe the only drawback is the absence of dialog...between characters which makes the impression a little “sleepy” while watchin.this anime is worth watching if you like anime that is short and yet has a deep story. on the other hand, this anime may not be suitable for people who don't like anime that don't have a lot of dialog, epic fight scenes, and graphics on par with ufotable and mappa."
Giji Harem,"I really thought this would be just another rom-com anime, especially given how confusing the scenes are in the first few episodes. But something about 𝐺𝑖𝑗𝑖 𝐻𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑚 makes me smile all the time. I also love the fact that Nobuhiko-kun (Bakugou & Garfiel) and Saori-chan (Yukino & Yor) are part of a love team—I always hear their voices in their popular roles. It’s such a fresh experience, and the show has this unique charm that sets it apart from other rom-com anime.It’s also a bonus that you get to ‘win’ every girl in this anime—Cool-chan, Imp-chan, Spoiled-chan, Tsundere-chan, and so on. You don’t even have...to pick a best girl because Nanakura Rin is already the best girl, all in one package! Ah, to date someone with such a talent for acting. This anime gave me a different perspective on actors, especially after watching/reading Rent-A-Girlfriend, which also has a best girl, Chizuru!I also love Eiji for just being himself—not a simp for Rin but still motivating her in his own way. I appreciate that he isn’t as talented as Rin but has his own unique characteristics that define him, and that’s what made Rin fall in love with him. I really find their relationship adorable!As I watched the final episode, I felt genuinely happy and satisfied with how everything progressed. This was a new experience for me, seeing an anime focus solely on Rin-chan and Eiji-kun all the way to the end. There’s no backstory for the side characters, as they’re just there to support the main characters—and I think that’s okay.Overall, this is a fantastic anime, and I’m not holding back on my rating: automatic 10/10! The OP and ED songs are also amazing—they perfectly capture the essence of 𝐺𝑖𝑗𝑖 𝐻𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑚."
Dragon Ball Z,"Although I didn’t grow up with Dragon Ball, it’s still one of those anime that I had an absolute blast watching. What stands out to me the most is Goku’s growth throughout the series, and the way the anime manages to combine action with heartwarming moments.The characters are incredibly likeable, each with their own charm, and the relationships between them are healthy and supportive—something I really appreciate after watching other series like Naruto, where the drama can feel overwhelming, especially with characters like Sasuke. Dragon Ball keeps things light-hearted without relying on excessive melodrama, and that’s exactly what makes it so enjoyable.I watched the first...two arcs, and I’ll never forget the pure joy of experiencing it for the first time. Those first seasons will always hold a special place in my heart as a classic, and I truly believe they’re some of the best in the anime world.As for Dragon Ball Super, I feel like it didn’t quite live up to the original series, but the first two parts will always remain a timeless favorite.If you’re looking for something fun, full of adventure, and with characters that bring a smile to your face, Dragon Ball is a must-watch!"
Umi ga Kikoeru,"'The Ocean Waves' is a meandering story that never goes anywhere, with a bad structure and two ""romantic"" leads with zero chemistry. And yet, I don't feel as if it wasted my time; the atmosphere and visuals were on point most of the time, and the great soundtrack helped in making this an OK experience. If you go in with no expectations, you might be pleasantly surprised. If you want something as good as the average Ghibli movie, though, you should look elsewhere.'From Up on Poppy Hill' and 'Whisper of the Heart' also nail the rural Japan summer aesthetic and the serene atmosphere, but with...great chemistry between the leads and plots that are much more interesting and engaging.This isn't a bad movie; but it's not a great one either, and there are similar stories that will make better use of their runtime."
Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Kyoto Douran,"This series is not getting the hype it needs.Although it's a great series. Season 1 was great and season 2 is also going fine as Kenshin travels to kyoto, along the way he meets new character. Season 2 is going to be a action banger. Animation is great as season 1. According to me season 2 great. Opening Play is also great i really loved it. It's a 8/10 for me but I m giving 9/10 because it's not getting the hype it needs. It's a hidden gem.Great animes such as this don't get the spotlight because of hyped new anime such as dandadan, blue...box and some popular sequels like danmachi, re: zero, blue exorcist, blue lock and much more. The series which i mention are great as well. Hope rurouni kenshin gets more attention."
Shiguang Dailiren,"You aren't ready for the ending...It seems rather innocent in the beginning.  But don't give up.If you are confused about what's going on, and how this universe works, that's intentional. It works you into the story. Starts you off slowly, and introduces different concepts and characters that you should pay attention to. I will admit, it may be difficult to see where the story is going at times.The two protagonists are great complements of each other, and offer comedic relief at times when necessary. They do very much drive the story forward, and you will feel yourself becoming connected to them....The art style is unique and refreshing. I like that it's something different, while at the same time, managing animations almost flawlessly. It's not at the same level as AOT or DS, but it does things better than most.One last thing I will say, I loved the concept of this story.  It's difficult to talk about this too much without giving away the story. If you enjoy mysteries and time travel, you will love this. This for me was a true masterpiece, no question. It kept me and my wife on the edge of our seats, so much so, where we were staying up late (with an infant child) to continue watching.(just wanted to edit to say that the ending song was an absolute banger, and fit perfectly ever time)."
Bakemonogatari,"Nisioisin you have charmed me beyond belief. Bakemonogatari is such a short and sweet story that truly charms the heart.While there are a lot of controversies with the series, especially the main character, I really do like that Araragi is a dickhead who has weird fetishes and is a dweeb loser. It humanizes him as opposed to idealizing him. What I truly think is the absolute greatest part of this anime however is Hitagi Senjougahara. Episode 12 of Bakemonogatari moved mountains, changed lives.If you have ever deeply loved, please give yourself the privilege of watching the first 12 episodes of Bakemonogatari at LEAST,...and if you have ever felt like your love has been unrequited, please watch the entire season. The series enchants the viewer so well with such a likeable cast of characters, and with its astonishing art direction there's no wonder why it's deemed a classic.NISIOISIN I WILL KILL FOR YOU"
Violet Evergarden,"*Disclaimer: This review is a repost of my original one, which was initially taken down by the review moderator. After clearing up some misunderstandings, they apologized and granted me permission to repost it. Thank you for your understanding!*Violet Evergarden — Masterpiece Coloured: Visually and Emotionally Deep.*Violet Evergarden* is a well-constructed story that includes war, recuperation, and growth of emotions in the plot. It involves Violet-a former child soldier trying to find her place in the post-war stage when she gets involved with Auto Memory Dolls-writing letters on behalf of people, trying to understand what her dear Major Gilbert meant by ""I love you.""Storyline & Concept:...It's a series that follows how a young girl discovers human emotions through the eyes of Violet, who has been blinded to feelings most of her life. Episodic in nature, each shows an aspect of love, loss, and recovery in this more introspective take of the series, making it really be about human emotions rather than action or grandeur as Violet journeys through different encounters.Character Development: The development of Violet from being an expressionless soldier to one that learns the meaning of emotions was very well carried out. Subtle and realistic, her growth developed with each episode through the various characters she met, reflections of parts of her inner struggle. Other minor characters like Hodgins and Cattleya contribute to the change.Visuals & Animation: Kyoto Animation delivers breathtaking visuals, with attention to detail that immerses viewers. The animation’s fluidity, color palette, and lighting make each scene emotionally resonant, enhancing the atmosphere and giving the story visual depth.Direction & Pacing: Nuanced in approach, Director Taichi Ishidate crafts an emotionally powerful experience. Pacing-wise, this series builds upon the very slow awakenings of Violet herself. It builds atmosphere and introspection instead of making her growth rushed. Each episode brings its tone of sorrow and hope, keeping the viewer within its emotive grip.Soundtrack & Composition: Evan Call's orchestral score perfectly complements the series, enhancing scenes rather than overwhelming them. The voice acting, especially Yui Ishikawa as Violet, is emotionally deep, developing from robotic tones in the beginning to richly expressive performances across the series.Conclusion: Violet Evergarden is among those few masterpieces in storytelling, animation, direction, and music, perfectly combined. Including the basic universal themes of trauma, love, and healing, the relatableness of the series as an exploration of how to live and interact with others becomes vivid."
Clannad: After Story,"*Disclaimer: This review is a repost of my original one, which was initially taken down by the review moderator. After clearing up some misunderstandings, they apologized and granted me permission to repost it. Thank you for your understanding!*Clannad: After Story - the masterpiece that perfects emotionally enriching storytelling.Clannad: After Story is acclaimed for its depth of emotion and realistic theme, thus fixing it into the reality of life. This sequel from the school setting of *Clannad* talks about love, loss, family, and struggles of life from a grown-up point of view. It gives insight into Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa-from the tender love of their...youth in married life to the births in their household.What sets it apart is the fact that it's not fantasy; Tomoya and Nagisa's struggles are real-life events that hit with full force, as evidenced in the bittersweet way life would have it.Character Development: The character development of Tomoya from a jaded young man into a responsible adult pays off-a true show of the joys and pains of growing up. Nagisa, the emotional linchpin of the series, really shines bright with her resilience, while the parents and other characters add texture to this world and make it tangible, lived-in.Visuals & Animation: Most recent series don't need to be flashier, but Kyoto Animation's work herein is powerful with warm colors and an expressively animated character showing every mood in the story. Merging this with symbolic scenes, especially in the Illusionary World, gave even more depth to the narrative.Direction & Pacing: Tatsuya Ishihara directs every emotional beat in Technicolor sans melodrama. He handled the jump in time very smoothly and made the viewer witness character growth organically. Indeed, the subtle shift of the series from comedy to seriousness reflects that from youth to adulthood.The on-point soundtrack and atmosphere of this series can also be credited for its beauty, thanks to Jun Maeda's beautiful score, with signature tracks such as ""Dango Daikazoku"" bringing so much poignancy into the scenes. Light yet powerful music and good voice acting lift every particular scene, especially in the development of Tomoya from a carefree youth to a man batted by life's storms.Objective Reasons for Scoring High:1. *Emotional Deepness & Relatability*: It approaches basic themes of serials such as grief, family, and persistence so easily and universally.2. *Character Development*: I would best describe that realistic development of Tomoya into a nuanced amount.3. *Direction & Storytelling*: The events that unfold show well-deserved emotional payoffs that feel truthful. 4. *Music &amp; Atmosphere*: This is sound and vision combined, appealing to all the senses.5. *Realism & Themes*: Presenting the bitterness and sweetness of life, *After Story* represents a hopeful or resolute message toward survival.Conclusion: *Clannad: After Story* is an incredibly emotional anime that runs the whole regarding themes and character development: real-life struggles, grown-up themes-one of the most memorable ways ever. This anime would be a classic with its fleshed-out characters, strong storytelling, and wonderful soundtrack-one that would be remembered for many years to come."
"Hazurewaku no ""Joutai Ijou Skill"" de Saikyou ni Natta Ore ga Subete wo Juurin suru made","The show was so bad I had to leave a comment ranting about it.Story wise the start feels like a cheap arifureta copy with extra dose of misery porn.Scene play was absolutely horrendous. Monsters just stare down and drool at the helpless MC waiting for him to get his shit together. The first monster at least chased after the MC for 10 seconds, until he tumbled and then just waited there for him to do something. The second monster hardly did nothing except dance awkwardly for a minute waiting for the MC to finish his internal monologue.Worst of all the animation is...a messy blend of 2d and 3d, jumping between them constantly without much thought. Even the 3d scenes are of such inconsistent quality that switching between them can be jarring. The show probably ran out of budget half way through the second episode and got dumped on interns that had never even studied animation."
Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan,"Closeted Monster Fucker is attracting hot singles near him.StoryThis is probably the best SFW ecchi anime out there.I really do be hating these characters with zero personality that get all the bitches. Am I going to do any work on myself? Hell no.Now the best part about this is the run time. A perfect >15 minute ecchi show. That...ArtI really wish Queen Bee would hire these animators. Would make their works better.As far as non hentai, it isn't the best nor is it the worst. Just in the lower end of the middle.Characters designs aren't special at all. Bleh humans. But the monsters is a different story. Personally love them more.Overall6/10, the hornest SFW slop that money can buy. If you come in expecting God tier, be disappointed. Watch only if you want brain off no consequence comedy."
30-sai made Doutei dato Mahoutsukai ni Nareru Rashii,"This show is really just romance perfection!Adachi, the protagonist, turns thirty and comes to find he has the power to read minds. While initially it’s not ideal for him to have this capability, he gets the chance to read a particular person’s mind and everything changes. This person is Kurosawa.Let me say that Adachi as a protagonist is complex, entertaining, and wholesome… and seeing his character development made me feel so proud for him. On the flip side, Kurosawa as the love interest is equally as multi-faceted and endearing. Their chemistry and love was utterly perfect.Because these characters are older, their relationship...from start to finish was refreshingly mature. I thoroughly loved that this wasn’t another teen romance, and not only that, but that the writers took great care in making their story feel real and believable for their ages. Even more so, the pacing was also perfect, which added to the genuineness of their romance.The only reason it doesn’t get a 10/10 rating from me is because of the other side characters’ romance. Their storyline wasn’t necessarily bad, but their relationship felt forced, and they inevitably offered nothing to the plot. I honestly would have preferred them removed altogether to get more of Adachi and Kurosawa.Despite the minor critique, this was truly wonderful and I HIGHLY recommend watching!!!!"
NieR:Automata Ver1.1a Part 2,"This is a story with the potential of a Masterpiece, and which very nearly missed it.This season was a spectacle, episode after episode. I will first comment on the technical aspects and then comment on the story itself.Technically it was a very well-done job. The animation along with the score knew how to elevate the moments of impact at the right dose and the direction itself was a spectacle. The telling of the story, the editing of the episodes, the form of revelations and the ambiance created were done in sublime ways. I'm blown away by A-1 Pictures' work on this anime. One of the...studio's biggest projects.Unfortunately, there were production problems, which, not only do the technical aspects not justify it, but they do make sense.Now, about the story itself: One of the most intriguing, thought-provoking, and reflective stories I've watched in recent times. It took me a while to get into the heart of the story (due to its difficult first season) but when I did, it was impressive and encouraged me to look for more outside of the anime. I will start the original material as soon as possible.In the world we live in today, full of technology, data, and doubts about the relationships between humans and machines, this anime has a remarkably interesting approach to relationships and a highly intelligent and complex construction that really made me think outside the box, beyond phrases and beautiful moments.""The future is not something you win, but something you conquer.""I highly recommend this anime to anyone."
Shinseiki Evangelion,"Daddy issues will cause the 3rd impact.StoryThe story starts of as a simple monster of the week deal and following the main cast with a slice of life elements which is nice after watching robot go brr on angel. Also it is nice seeing biblically accurate angel.Then it gets stupidly weird and shows us that these characters are so traumatized that at any single moment during a fight will cause a domino effect.No chat. You cannot fix any of these characters. They in fact will make you worse....It's weird. I know the Kingdom Hearts timeline and a bit of Metal Gear Solid timeline. I am so confused on what is actually canon and what isn't. I still enjoyed my time watching it, it is just a little issue that I am thinking about post watch.AnimationIt is from the 90s. At the time it was groundbreaking and it is a very good looking show for the most part.The character designs for everyone is top notch and unique. Is it because this is one of the few surviving shows that somehow lived though to today? That helps it out a lotOverall9/10 Misato is the only good choice. If you picked anyone else, please pack your bags and leave. Your lobotomy will be scheduled on your behalf."
Kakegurui,"I feel compelled to write this review to offer some kind of explanation for why this anime is on my favorites list. It's very simple really, Kakegurui is what happens when writers are given free reign to do whatever they like. Kakegurui is batshit crazy to a degree that fully and utterly transcends typical degeneracy. This is NOT your average fantasy isekai. The plot is structured but completely wild, the characters are clinically insane, and all of them are into each other. Even the fanservice in this anime can't even truly be called fanservice. Fanservice is meant to please the audience, but what you get...here is borderline disgusting and the show makes sure you know that it's gross.All the characters are superhuman geniuses who spend their entire day gambling at a school with NO teachers. Somehow the student council president has the same level of power as the leader of a small country. The gambling games are highly complicated and not even explained well. They don't need to be, as everything is a power fantasy for Jabami Yumeko. Essentially, Kakegurui is so bad that it ends up reversing in the other direction and becoming diabolically entertaining. There are a lot of shows focused on escapism, whether it be isekai or shoujo romances, but in Kakegurui you're escaping and descending into freakiness.Kakegurui is an experience and in all honesty, I absolutely loved it. There's that famous quote from the Dark Knight, ""some men just want to watch the world burn"", and THAT is what I felt watching Jabami Yumeko eviscerate her opponents while her breasts triple in size, her eyes turn into glowing red sirens, and her face becomes that of a monster.Final Rating: 7"
Tokidoki Bosotto Russia-go de Dereru Tonari no Alya-san,"(TW: Feet)She sure does Sometimes Hide Her Feelings in Russiantbh this show peaks early, because it eventually becomes an uninteresting student council election.The titular Alya is your standard tsundere but Russian-flavored. She, as the title implies, speaks in Russian occasionally and uses that to flirt with the MC. She's a fine character, good design, solid lead heroine, but I wouldn't say she had this MAGNETIC charisma to her, which the series seems to think she does. The student council election in particular involves her being carried by the MC from tagging her out during an anxiety episode to planning out her second speech, if she...wasn't propped up by the MC, she'd fall apart like a house of cards. Hell, her speech at the end is basically ""I work hard, please vote for me!"".This is the main problem with this series. It's a tale of two shows.The two main heroines are pretty good in a romcom setting but as soon as we're in the election, the not-Alya girl turns into The Final Boss and Alya loses all charm. Even the MC has to turn his ""prodigy"" swag on to drag Alya's dead weight through the finish line. There is not a single character who benefits from the student council election portion, all 3 of the characters who have an extended portion of romcommy goodness are significantly less interesting when they are in the election.So how about that second girl?To be honest, I'd heard more about Yuki than Alya coming into this show and yes, she was my favorite girl in the romcom portions. She was funny, gremlin-coded, one of my favorite types of waifus.However, when it starts talking about the election, she just becomes an opponent and kind of condescending and scheming and just kind of unpleasant. That being said, she seems like the objectively better candidate in the election?Also in the context of a romcom, I don't think she ""works""?Unless you're dedicated to being ""the incest show"", you CANNOT have the blood-related little sister be a ""main"" love interest.Maybe if there were, like, 5 of them like in Quintessential Quintuplets, but Maria and Ayano are really the only girls I could see being argued as MC's haremettes and really, I don't believe that. It's really just Alya and Yuki.And, like, the show is called ALYA SOMETIMES HIDES HER FEELINGS IN RUSSIAN, it's one of those shows where, yeah, no shit Alya's gonna win the harem arms race (if you can even call it that), but idk, Yuki should hit me harder than she did.There are shows, good shows, that have 2 main heroines and while one is obviously the frontrunner, at least you can make a case for the other one? What am I supposed to do with this?Speaking of Maria, she's kind of the onee-san of the show and I'm pretty sure she's implied to be the girl who made MC learn Russian in the first place, so she should be in prime position to win the harem arms race but... she kinda just lets Alya win? Which, sure, whatever, but as a result, she's just kind of onee-san flavored tap water to me.I think they should have let Yuki just be little sister comedic relief and Maria be the rival to Alya imo.And if your argument is ""well, you're just ASSUMING it's a harem because the MC is surrounded by pretty women that happen to have a significant interest in him (except one which shoutout to them for having a non-MC relationship between a male and a female, that's hard to come by in these shows)"", yes, that may be true.I still think Yuki being Alya's rival is weird. The drama isn't interesting and Yuki should've just been comic relief, if you didn't want any harem shenanigans but you still wanted the student council election arc, there is literally a character in this show that could have taken Yuki's place. Speaking of which, Sayaka. Who cares, lol. She's got the resolve of a soggy tissue so she's really only there to make the main characters look better....no one else is really worth mentioning outside of the MC.Let's talk about the MC then.The MC is shown at the beginning to be a slacker and an otaku so he can be ~so relatable~ but then it turns out that, no, he's actually a genius prodigy who is the bestest and the coolest and whatever, man.I suppose he's got more personality than your average generic MC but he's not particularly a standout of the show, in any case.Speaking of the MC, I cannot take this melodramatic family shit seriously. I won't say much else for spoiler reasons but all the family and student election drama made me roll my eyes. This show does much better at being a cute romcom than it does a drama but it insists on trying to be both and as such, it stops feeding us as much cute romcom as we deserve.I guess I should applaud it for having more soul in it than to just be a cutesy fluffy romcom with a bunch of girls fawning over the MC but it genuinely would have been better off if it was just that."
Shingeki no Kyojin,"Simply the perfect premise and start a show can have. The atmosphere of fear, uneasiness, anxiety everything is just peak. The sheer curiosity of wanting to know what the hell happens next is on another level. You can literally NEVER guess how the hell are things going to turn in this show. Its just soo unpredictable. The characters are all great, some make you like them. And if they die the feeling of sadness is very deep. The action and animation is peak. Every kind of viewer will enjoy this show in my opinion.ITS A PEAK PIECE OF MEDIA recommended for everyone."
Smile Precure!,"If there was one word I could use to describe this anime, I’d say adorable. Character designs: Adorable. Storyline: Adorable. Even the attacks are adorable. I also love how it handles different personalities, like making Glitter peace feel shy and a little left out because she’s not the most athletic, and making glitter spring seem tough and athletic, but actually has a big heart. i highly recommend this to sailor moon and any magical girl fan in general. I love how much passion was put into the voice acting, especially with the villains, and i love how fairytales are included in so much."
"Saikyou no Shienshoku ""Wajutsushi"" de Aru Ore wa Sekai Saikyou Clan wo Shitagaeru","This is the best thing I've watched the last couple months, gotta tell you I'm beyond surprised. It's addictive, has a bunch of compelling characters, the ""edgy"" stuff isn't cringe, it's always on point. I miss shit like this fr. Truth be told, I don't think i've seen an anime with this energy since 2016. It got everything you could ever ask for. Plus the MC isn't a cringe beta male doing edgy stuff for the sake of it. It's indeed a great piece of work to binge watch on an afternoon. I've felt a mix of Fairy Tail and Tokyo Ghoul there but in...the right amount. It's a shame to think it'll be one more of those shows with a ridiculous year-gap between season and people won't give a damn or be hyped at all to the next. Plus the ""slave"" girl has some personality unlike that one from Rising shield hero lol. Thoroughy worth watching!"
Street Fighter II Movie,"Ancient anime but this one needs a new review: Game adaptations have been around even longer than you think. This is an adaptation of the Street Fighter II game, which you remember if you’re Gen X. If you’re not Gen X, know this was a very popular game in the 90s, I’ve played it myself (back in college) and am not even a gamer… This is a 30 year old adaptation of the game but it really surprised me. It looks old, the character designs look kind of inspired by American comicbook muscle guys they look HUGE and clunky, with massive square faces, blank white...eyes, and jaws sharp enough to cut steel, nevermind that Guile’s hair looks like a shoe-polishing brush- the action in this is really good and there were some really surprising scenes. I sort of expected to be bored and just laughing at it, but it was pretty interesting and had a good mix of action and dialogue- decent voice acting; and the visuals are richly colored and the art, the backgrounds are quite good. Even the cars looks accurate- and awesome! There are a couple different 911s, a Shelby Mustang (of course) with New York plates, several detailed Jeeps, an 84 Cadillac, an S-Class Mercedes and incredibly- Ambassador cars in India! A lot of thought and passion was put into this anime and it shows.The globe trotting was a real delight; they’re in a different city in each segment. My favorite scenes took place in India of all places! I have been looking for an anime set in India forever, and it’s only one segment but it looked surprisingly good and has easily the movie’s cutest character, a little girl who is more moe than moe OMG… I wish we got her name she was so sweet! We need more cute Indian girls in our anime now!!The main characters in this of course are Ken and Ryu, the two title characters from the game. Other playable characters are also in this like Chun-Li and Cammy… the girls are beefy but also beautiful, I fell in love with Chun-Li after her heroic fight that was very suspenseful.The soundtrack is mostly 90s elevator music (I felt like midi music was better than most of it), but some of the songs were memorable- like the guitar song that plays in Chun-Li’s apartment.Of course we can’t forget their magical fight moves! Ken’s HADOUKEN! (“Ha-DOOOO-ken!”) Ryu’s SHORYUKEN! (“Sho-YUUU-ken!”) Oh man I haven’t heard them shout that in almost 30 years! Talk about key jangling…Another surprise in this: the CGI. Yes- this 30 year old anime actually has some! It’s actually integrated pretty well, and not overused. Back in those days, integrating the CGI with cel animation was actually the challenge. This one does it decently- it won’t amaze you with tech- but it looks fine.I would say its one weakness is the fights on the mountaintop, that went on a bit too long and the generic background felt like a game scene rather than a movie, and made them less impactful. (Now how do we get down from here?)Then the American choppers come to take down their BASE. Ahh the base!!In the 80s and 90s all bad guys had to have a base- when we were little kids after watching our after-school cartoons what ever game you played outside- even hide&seek- the key objective was to capture the opponent's base- the base was everything! And the base this time is in the jungles of Southeast Asia- so with everything it does this anime even manages to give us Americans one last shot at revenge for Vietnam lolol. I really thought that was quite funny!The ending was okay, then some elevator music plays- but I rate this high for being very entertaining; extremely well made, faithful to the game but given a plot that has high enough stakes you actually care about seeing the next scenes;If you’re of the slightly older generation that remembers this game, or you are truly curious to see what ancient game adaptations were like in the 90s, this is a must watch. They don’t make them like this anymore- but I sure wish they did."
Dandadan,"I came into this with high expectations but was immediately let down in the first episode. There was maybe one part in it where I was impressed. It was too fast paced and too typical of the beginning of anything in shonen jump these days, which is incredibly fast paced and let's get to the point and establish everything. There's no slow burns anymore, which is really unfortunate. The series does bounce back after the first couple episodes though, with it finally hitting a bit of groove in the 7th and 8th episodes. We'll see where it goes but, I am a bit hopeful that...the series will continue to grow on me. The comedy was falling flat until recently, and I think the addition of more characters is helping, as Momo and Okarun's relationship is a bit one dimensional and annoying without a third or fourth character to bring some variety. I wasn't very fond of the voice acting either, as both main character comes off as a bit annoying, especially when they're bickering. So, bringing in Aira was a much need reprieve. Her voice actress is amazing, which is really ironic when you consider how bad the other two are. I'm talking about the Japanese by the way. Okarun's actor also plays Tanjiro in Demon Slayer, a role I think he does very well, and it could be that because his voice is so unique, I'm having trouble assigning it to a new character. But I do feel like the voice is just not a great fit for Okarun's character and not what I'd expect him to sound like. But, it has grown on me a bit. Momo's actress is a bit too masculine if you ask me, which seems like what they were going for but, I'm not a huge fan of it. But, again, it has also started to grow on me so, hopefully if the writing stays good I will be able to get behind their voices.I think what's also really helped the later episodes is the introduction of more serious undertones. They hinted at it a bit early on, but it wasn't developed enough. It really came into its own in the latest episodes and it makes the story much more interesting. There is of course a scary part to the show as well, which I think is also pretty well done, as it's all fairly balanced, at least in the last two episodes. Before that it was oscillating too much between jokes and scary. It didn't help that the jokes were just not funny either. The first 5 episodes or so are really not that good and may be a bit hard to get through at first but, I think once you get past those, you'll see a bit of a light at the end of the tunnel."
Ranma ½ (2024),"Pretty early to give too much of an opinion but, so far, I love this show. It didn't blow me away right away, however, based on the premise, I thought it was going to be a complete waste of time and stupid but, to my surprise, it's actually very entertaining. It is kind of stupid in a sense, as it's pretty much one big running gag but, I haven't tired of it yet. I just hope it can keep up the momentum. The animation is top notch, as is the voice acting and producing. The sounds, music, it all blends very nicely. Pack all that...in with something where you don't have to follow too closely and is constantly pulling hilarious stunts, you got yourself a really enjoyable show. I'm sure there will be a lot of people who this will not be for however. But if you love romance stuff and also love comedy and slice of life stuff, I'd absolutely recommend this. Japanese sub is how I'm watching it by the way. It's awesome so, I would not recommend the English. You have some of the best voice actors I've ever heard in anime. They fit their respective roles perfectly. I would never think something like this would make me want to give a 10 but, if it can keep up this momentum the whole series, that's what it will be."
Uma Musume: Pretty Derby - Shin Jidai no Tobira,"One of the best movie I've ever seenBOANE premiered in cinemas on May 24th this year, and I've waited for a chance to see it outside of cinemas, especially with the high praise it got from those who got the opportunity to see it. Even with the high bar of expectation that was set for it, it exceeded it in all metrics.Tight pacing, incredible composition, beautiful colors, fluid animation, wonderful character writing, and acting, and it all meshes in 1 hour and 45 minutes of absolute cinema. It is everything that you'd want in a movie. Everything that Cygames has done in the past is completely...outclassed by this movie, for it seems that they took what they've learned from making previous shows like Priconne and bangbangbravern and applied that knowledge to make this movie.Will not go into details so that more people can watch this unspoiled, but I will point out my one nitpick of the movie is Cafe's slightly lacking involvement in the movie, despite being promoted as part of the main 4. This is a nitpick because she did serve her purpose in the narrative and theme of the movie, but I do think it is the time constraint of 1 hour and 45 minutes that causes this, however, this does mean that they managed to focus more on Jungle pocket and keeping the pacing tight, which is definitely the right decision."
No.6,"Given the sorry state of BL anime these days (chock full of non consensual harassment and overdone seme/uke tropes), I was eagerly awaiting something different, more real, in No 6. Instead of focusing on only the romantic aspect, here was a BL that wanted to tell a story, and a dystopian one no less. Suffice it to say, it was a massive disappointment that I should have already foreseen looking at its middling MAL score. No 6 turned out to be an amalgamation of BL tropes all the way down from the miscommunication to the overly aggressive seme to the needless angst. And all this...is loosely tied up together with a nonexistent hair-thin plotline. This is all you really need to know about what I think of this anime, but since I am rage writing this, I will get into spoilers below.No 6 loses its vision after like the third episode. The plot should be about realizing the current utopia is flawed and rebelling/taking action, like most other dystopian fiction. Instead, all the action happens quickly and is left unresolved, and then everyone just settles down to wait…?There’s this strange killer wasp that seems to be a weapon of the utopia, but halfway through the series we’ve gotten no progress towards the characters finding out its creator or purpose (even just realizing the administrators controlled it would be fine). And so brown hair turned white haired boy camps out with the seme love interest and everything up until the halfway point is them beefing with each other in the most angsty way possible.White haired boy can’t understand why the love interest hates society, and he won’t tell him either. So there’s a stalemate where eventually dark hair will probably give in because white hair is such a cinnamon roll. It’s so pointless because why can’t they just sit down and talk about it? I understand there are topics that are hard to talk about for people, but in writing there are ways to show that and have them open up. One of those ways is definitely not having the angsty character trash talk and threaten the cinnamon roll and then underscore that with a heap of sexual tension.I’ve never written a review for an anime that I haven’t completed before, but this one made me so annoyed for no reason. No 6 has a plethora of other issues, but if I talked about them this review would get to be as long as my Fruits Basket one. Just know that it’s bad.Final Rating: 3"
Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon,"This is one of my favourite anime and I watched it over and over when I was in my teens. However, now that I'm older, I still love it, but I'm also deeply uncomfortable with it. I'm fine with fan-service and I don't care if it's in a show. However, since this is directed towards and sometimes includes characters who are children, I cannot say in good faith that this is a show I can be supportive of. I don't care that Kanna is 1000 years old when the other dragons refer to her as a child in age and is a character who literally...attends elementary school.It's just not something I'm morally okay with despite loving other aspects of this show."
Tokyo Ghoul √A,"During the second season, I couldn't help but think that the plot reflected the battle between the scriptwriters and the mangaka, which ended epically with the victory of the project management, who had their own ideas about the series. And the most important thing for them is decency, not to be taken off the air, and therefore the censorship in ""Tokyo Ghoul"" will be crude and ruthless, up to and including drawing anything but the affected character.Because the creators of the anime pulled the rug out from under each other, refusing to make any concessions to each other, the adaptation itself came out piecemeal....The plot was cut more than once and more than twice, resulting in ""unexpected"" twists without logic or justification. The screenwriters were torn between the manga and the directives from above, so that a viewer who watches two or three episodes in a row runs the risk of getting lost in the multiple twists and turns of the plot, freaking out and giving up.Unfortunately, it is impossible to give an example of the most strikingly unreasonable decisions of the main character, because it is already a spoiler. But I assure you, your logic will be infinitely offended.A particular disappointment is the beginning of the second season. For some reason, the scriptwriters decided to mangle an almost finished product (the manga) based on God knows what calculations, but miscalculated so monstrously with the beginning of the series. Perhaps Ishida would have died defending this part, because the opening is entirely in his style: the sprawling watercolours, the flowers representing all aspects of human life, and the protagonist static in oblivion. All of this may be beautiful, but most people expect something else from ""Tokyo Ghoul"": action, cruelty, struggle, not contemplation of the futility of existence.Speaking of futility, the deaths in this season were clumsy and pathetic, most of them were never killed, and if they were, it would have been better not to touch them. If most of the deaths in the manga have something to teach us, to prove some author's thesis, so that the reader can't take his eyes off them, the anime has managed to level all the mangaka's achievements.I'll tell you a secret: the last episode of the first season contained everything that could be squeezed out of the story, everything else just promises some kind of life lesson to be taught to Kaneki and the audience.A bit about the characters: the active ones are no more than a dozen. The rest are put out for epic contemplation behind the acting ones. They're just set pieces that pop up a few times for a pathos line or a tail/sword swing.  And you, the viewer, don't understand why they exist at all. What do they change? And if they do, why? Tired of an active character? Take the inactive one and kill him quickly. Why does such a strong character, who has been twirling in front of the viewer for the entire 12 episodes, kick the bucket so quickly? Because. And that's all the viewer is left with. Following the same pattern, the active character takes out the inactive ones in packs, so that they do not even have time to open their mouths.On the dynamics of the fights and the battle schema: The decisions made by the scriptwriters will make you cry out of hopelessness. Favourite scheme: to let a large number of people become cannon fodder with rifles, and when they're finished - to feed all the ghouls in the area, only then to finally release officers with wunderwaffles. At the same time, superiors at all levels sincerely see it as a tactic. And they accept wills in piles.The scene in which an old lady - just a civilian - was injured was particularly shocking. According to the scenario, the epic battle with the collapse of buildings is taking place in a residential area where no one has been evacuated. No one is interested in what is going on, no one is looking out of the windows to see the neighbourhood collapsing, everyone is sitting at home, probably drinking tea.There are a lot of these weird bloopers. They accumulate from episode to episode and become so irritating that you try to finish the anime out of sheer stubbornness.Fans of the manga - I do not recommend watching it. Fans of the first season - give it a try.I still rate it highly, although I have a very negative attitude towards the second season. The reason is that some parts of the plot of the manga were still realised, and for that it was worth watching everything."
Yoru wa Mijikashi Arukeyo Otome,"If I was to be told that aspects of everything I love in media would be combined into this film I wouldn't have expected it to be this outcome. The absurdism of this film is so engaging that it felt that I was along for the ride with all the other characters. Beautiful art direction had me in awe at some of what was on screen. I love the message throughout as well for as nonsensical it had been. I found myself not knowing where to story would lead next, appreciating all the whimsical motifs throughout. Would definitely reccomend for people looking for a work...to sit down and fully take it. Before going in have an open mind."
Ao no Miburo,"Absolute trash. There are like 3-4 fight scenes across 6 episodes and they're all underwhelming in every way possible. It's absolutely unacceptable to have a SAMURAI anime tagged as ACTION with barely any fighting scenes, and the few fights we have are on par with blue lock's animation. Also constant talk no jutsu, at least in naruto there was a balance between talking and fighting.The story itself is a bit stale, there's barely any progression. The emotional monologues by the MC are so out of place and unprompted most of the time that I can't help but cringe. This anime tries to be sentimental but...fails. It also has some BL vibes, but nothing outright gay or anything.Originally I reviewed this anime after 3 episodes, it had the same issues early on but I had a bit of hope because the story was finally going somewhere and I was really hoping the ""action"" part of the anime will eventually come to life, but it didn't.Do NOT watch this anime, it's a waste of your time"
Kaijuu 8-gou,"Great show, I was impatiently waiting for every episode to come out. I watched the show with the english dub.The characters are well written and the english dub makes them more lifelike by using older gen Z slangs. I also find that the dub managed to make me chuckle with every joke, while the sub often made them alot less funny.The art is nice, the characters have an unique look, the environment is detailed and the animation is pretty good.The music is great and one song managed to get into my running playlist.The studio changed up alot from the manga for the better, the combat...encounters are easier to understand while at the same time having more depth."
Ore dake Level Up na Ken,"Solo Leveling was trhilling to watch and i can recommend it to every viewer that usually enjoys action anime.I'll try to describe down below the pros and cons of this show, without spoiling anything. Keep in mind that I haven't read the webtoon nor did I have special expectations for this adaptation.The pros :+ Good animation, the fighting scenes are done well, the character designs are pretty good too.+ Even if this show goes for the ""OP MC"" trope, it remains believable enough, and the events presented in the anime allow the mc to still face some dangers, which isn't always...the case with this trope.+ There is some violence in this show, but it's used in a good way that isn't common enough in the fantasy genre, it feels refreshing to see those moments & reactions in anime.The cons :To put it simply, the biggest cons are the narrative & exposition, they prevent the show from being a truly great one because they aren't innovative and even fall into pretty bad/boring clichés sometimes. Here are a few examples :- Some dialogues are poorly written, they can become quite repetitive or too blunt ( like the show wants to make the viewers understand that the MC is weak for instance, well in the first episode, pretty much EVERY dialogue between the MC and another character will highlight his weaknesses... )- The anime will often make the main character talk out loud to himself alone to describe his actions/feelings, and come on, it's tedious to witness those moments, the weird thing is that there are also some moments where at least they thought about making him talk to himself in his head...- While the story is interesting, it also feels a bit underwhelming because they don't really take the time to explain the lore. There is a quick scene at the beginning of the first episode and that's about it, they'll explain a few rules here and there throughout the first episodes and won't develop much more. It's disappointing because it feels like there'd be quite a lot to say about a modern world that had to adapt to alien invasions on a daily basis through random portals...TL;DR :All in all, Solo Leveling does the job and will fulffill most of its promises : it's an action-packed anime with well animated fighting scenes, epic moments, a main character that will have to surpass himself through tough battles, but is it good enough to call this a masterpiece ? Well no, it's quite far from being one actually, unfortunately, the show lacks a lot in the narrative/exposition department, you'll find ""redflags"" that reflect those flaws such as bad dialogues, overused stereotypes, and the world building is hardly developped. Those cons won't prevent you from enjoying the show, but they restrain it from reaching higher heights and becoming a truly great adaptation many fans were waiting for."
Isekai Shikkaku,"Review for a specific episode (Episode 8)Episode 8 of the anime really stands out more than the other story our protagonist encountered in his journey. One of many episodes on any anime I've watched that really showcase a great storytelling technique with the exposition of the episode itself.The story on Episode 8 was executed really good. Introduced the issue at the town of Torineko along with a new character(s): Yamada and Esche, that happens to be at the center of the premise.Perfectly shown the story of what heroes meant and the 2 sides of the coin.Really enforces what Dazai said regarding being righteous...and being evil. It also shows reality of what people are when it comes to moral and ethical standards and how a collective outlook can be at times become a danger if not properly communicated.The end caught me off guard a bit though this kind of ending was something I have encountered before.Because of this episode, my overall expectation with this anime really rose. Great work."
Look Back,Great Movie that showing how can one friend changing a person life by having the same hobby that motivate the mc after she was abandoned the art but with simple complement revive the passion that scene show us that the human can continue doing he's purpose for the people who was appreciate he's work in addition the movie giving us a massage to keep continue our goals that we've dreame about and keep working with discipline and determination
Blue Lock vs. U-20 Japan,"What they did to Blue Lock Season 2 is beyond disappointing. This was a series with so much potential, but they somehow managed to turn it into an absolute disaster. The one thing that Blue Lock got right in the first season was the high energy, the intensity of the competition, and the emotional stakes of the characters. But in Season 2? It’s like they completely forgot what made the series special.First off, the animation is a mess. It’s clunky, lifeless, and it honestly looks like they ran out of time or budget halfway through. What was once a show with fluid, fast-paced action now...feels like watching a slideshow of still frames. It’s a far cry from the kinetic energy that the manga captured so perfectly. There’s nothing dynamic about it anymore. If anything, it’s just a bunch of character models awkwardly posed and barely moving. If I wanted to watch that, I’d just watch a stop-motion tutorial on YouTube. It’s honestly insulting.The pacing is even worse. I get it, the manga has its slow moments too, but at least it builds tension and keeps you invested. Here, it’s just all over the place. It feels like they stretched a story that should’ve been covered in a few episodes into a painfully long, drawn-out mess. You could watch paint dry and it would probably be more exciting than some of these filler-filled episodes. What used to feel like a race against time now feels like a drag.And the art style? Don’t even get me started. The manga’s art is sharp, full of energy, and every panel bursts with raw emotion. In the anime? It’s flat. It’s boring. Characters who were once larger-than-life now look like they’re just standing there, waiting for their next line. It lacks the psychological depth that the manga nails with every page. Instead of capturing the fire and drive of these young athletes, it makes them seem completely disconnected from the story they’re supposed to be in.I don’t care if you’re a fan of the genre or not—this season is just not worth it. The anime has stripped away everything that made Blue Lock worth watching and left us with this hollow, lifeless shell. The manga is where the magic is. Go read it, seriously. This anime adaptation is an embarrassment. I’ll be thinking about what could’ve been while I throw up in disgust.Never again.Better h*ntai anime than blue lock S2!Not body ✖Only Hair ✔4/10"
Beck,"this is one of those shows that sticks with u. it’s a raw and emotional story about chasing dreams, growing up, and finding yourself through music. the animation isn’t all that, but that just adds to its charm. the characters feel real, and the soundtrack is incredible. the references from real life rock albums adds such a good touch, putting me on some good ass albums that i didn't know about.some episodes might be boring but the build-up for the next episodes makes up for it. the character designs are amazing, dressing them up greatly fitting into the 90s-00s theme, since it was in...the era of where rock genre was sky rocketing in japan. i feel like if you have the patience to watch some of the boring episodes to wait for the build-up event to happen, you would love it a lot, and if you love music, especially the rock genre, you would love this a lot more.also maho."
"Maou-sama, Retry!","This is for sure a trash isekai. You've got an overpowered protagonist who builds up a questionable harem in a generic fantasy world. I should have stopped watching on the second episode the second time he asks the young girl he saved to go take a bath, and he spanks a mage. It's trash, but the plot is entertaining enough to keep you invested. Maybe I was just bored.I'm trying to think of something it did okay. I guess the characters didn't seem as soulless as some isekai. Maybe a little bit of thought went into their personalities/dialogue. There were a few lines I enjoyed/thought...were clever.Overall a few character designs are pretty egregious in terms of fanservice. They are also always taking a baths, although it didn't seem as focused as the fanservice aspect during those scenes as I thought it might. I am interested in seeing how far this goes. I may watch the next season. My review is basically I shouldn't have even wanted to finish this, but I was entertained enough to, and may even watch the next season."
Tiger Mask W,"if you like wrestling, you'll probably enjoy it, even tho they mention the original tiger mask from time to time, you can watch this without prior knowledge of the original series, the story it's not that grade, i'll even say that in some chapters it feels like they lost the plot or the sense of urgency, i loved every minute of it, specially the chapters where they fight in the countryside, my biggest problem with this series it's okada, he gotta be the biggest fraud i've ever seen in an anime, all that glacing about being the njpw heavyweight champion, and just one or two...victory on screen, the rest of his match are either offscreen or him losing, i swer , i have more memories of ryu the jobber winning and fighting more on screen than the supposedly champion , i hate him, what a fraud"
Black Lagoon,"Review of Black LagoonAs an action anime, *Black Lagoon* falls short in several areas. The action scenes lack dynamism and fluidity, which is a major issue for a series that’s supposed to excel in this genre. The animation, while decent for a 2006 release, often shows its limitations with stiff movements and a lack of detail in some sequences.The humor, intended to lighten the tone, feels forced and poorly integrated, making it more frustrating than enjoyable. It undermines the overall atmosphere and makes certain scenes awkward to watch.Despite a promising setting and a few interesting moments, the series lacks consistency. Black Lagoon isn’t a disaster,...but it doesn’t stand out in terms of action or storytelling. It’s a fairly average anime that doesn’t quite live up to expectations."
Hypnosis Mic: Division Rap Battle - Rhyme Anima,"Ah, Hypnosis Microphone - the rap-battle anime EVER. Me personally, I've always been a big fan of music projects, and Hypnosis Microphone is definitely one of my favourites. The story itself might be a little odd—a bunch of men fighting with microphones that cause hypnosis—but after some time, you get used to it, and especially after playing the game itself, you've probably already been striving for the anime adaptation.But story aside, the designs of the characters are absolutely wonderful and what's better is that you get to learn something new about them each episode. The music is all so well too, with creative lyrics. Each...division's members have their own unique charm, and I like BAT and BB the most! (It's really difficult to pick favourites to be honest, though..!)And of course for my fellow fujoshi and fudanshi out there; perhaps Hypnosis Microphone is heaven for us. After all, who wouldn't like an anime about a bunch of gay men grouped together singing using microphones that cause hypnosis to fight against a group of homophobic women? XDThat's all I've got to say about Hypnosis Microphone. If you're a fan and want to learn more about Hypnosis Microphone, I would recommend you check out the mangas and the game too! But unfortunately there isn't an English translation of the game yet, but you can look up translations of stories on the net.Thank you for reading, hehe. ^_^"
Hibike! Euphonium,"I came in expecting more focus on music and less on drama, however it seems to be the other way around slightly. Despite that, it really outperformed my expectations, even with its popularity and ratings. I didn't expect to tear up at the ending scene, but I did.It's hard to point out what exactly it is, but this anime does something really well when it comes to drama. You get drawn into the competitiveness of playing in an ensemble, you get invested in everyone's individual story: what they do, what they try to achieve, their challenges and achievements. The highs and lows of the band...affect you like you're part of it.However it's a bit disappointing that the musical part of a music centered anime is a bit neglected. Most performances are shortened or outright cut out, which sometimes makes you feel like the anime doesn't even focus on music and it's solely a drama that happens to have some music. For example YLIA didn't shy away from featuring full performances (that sometimes even took up half the episode) and it worked out so well. It all comes down to screentime, it's not just musical performances that are shortened/cut, there's a bit of rush in pacing, some tiny time skips and whatnot. This season should've been 23-24 episodes long or should've adapted less.Apart from that there are no issues. There's some yuri bait that felt unnecessary, but not obnoxious so it's not that much of an issue.It's a must watch for everyone I think. If you like music and/or drama it's pretty straightforward, if not then it's one of those animes that shine in their genre that you should try even if you're not a fan."
Yeosin Gangnim,"To my amazement, the True Beauty K-drama adaptation was a fairly good watch, reasonable enough to include about as much of the storyline as was maintained from the webtoon. I can say it was a hit but one that was ok but would not revolutionize the industry. To the best of my judgement, the drama did find a good balance – it was moving yet not fundamentally misplaced alongside the main emphasis of the plot, even if the main center of focus was not honed. There were some stereotypical features that K drama lovers have come to expect: the drama element, the love triangle affair...and the fait accompaniment of little drama. But admittedly, I like these elements. Without them, it is difficult to imagine what in fact gives K-dramas the unique and special identity in the first place. They provide an opportunity of identifying more easily with the characters though at times this detracts from the nature of the story and slows down events in the drama.While watching True Beauty, watching these emotional layers helped the characters. The characters were relatable and almost vulnerable — something that did not quite come off with the anime adaptation. Outer beauty, or pleasing the society was not the point of it; it was deeper, more inner conflicts, and every character had their own problem. The reality, the way the show handled these particular issues was realistic, although, sometimes maybe it went a bit too melodramatic. Incorporating the arcs of self acceptance of the characters, specially the main character it may have drawn some of the fans for the drama, for me, one of them is that. Or it might’ve been explained as the Wokey and cheesy in some cases, but I’d call it out K-drama bane. We always expect tension from them and as a result we always end up emotionally invested in the plot. You're very finely walking a line to stay with the major tale and still attempt to work with the moody scenes and I think the drama overall has gotten that harmony.What was the anime version of that, in contrast, was rather, I don’t know, average, I guess. I at least hoped the show would bring something new in despite the fact that there wasn’t too much excitement in my heart for it, given the anime’s creative scope. Unfortunately, it failed to produce the feeling and emotion that was a core element of True Beauty and thus became very popular in being a manhwa to draw. The animation was medium quality and the pace was so quick it didn’t allow any character development to take place that the plot required. In the anime, it seems that instead of going into the heart of the character change and the social conflict with which they must contend, that plot points in the anime were spent making sure they packed in as much as they could which ultimately blunted these emotional climaxes. It was unfortunate because there’s so much you can do with anime when it comes to delivering both a personal challenge as well as an epic story without taking a dilution angle like True Beauty.Anime, unlike other art forms, can completely encompass the viewer and immerse them into an author’s desire in ways that are hard to achieve through live-action. If there is an author’s vision, there is also a director who works to achieve that vision in full by achieving the right colors, shapes and frequent infusing of the smallest details that make up the author’s imagination. Because of this, even the most fantastic worlds are portrayed in the most believable fashion. In anime, every aspect about a character and scene originates from the creator’s vision, combining together to tell their story exactly as it was meant to be told. In this way, anime provides an uncanny degree of accuracy to the viewer in terms of what the creator’s intentions were, and this brings about an experience that is not only memorable but a realistic sensation to the audience. This potential is what I was expecting to get from True Beauty’s anime adaptation; however, it did not come to fruition which was unfortunate.Although they failed to produce a good anime adaptation, the idea of using manhwas as reference to anime is something which I look forward to. Since constantly expanding the anime industry, it is not just limited to adapting from Japanese manga, and I believe this is great. It offers so many opportunities to tell different kinds of stories, influence them with different cultures, create more varied characters which can be interesting to everyone around the globe. Not every story can be made in live-action because some stories are stylized or have setting or internal world that need artistic liberty to create. Here, there is an opportunity of engendering such magnanimous impressions fit to the screen without the imposition of realistic drama, and harness the potential of the manga-inspired format to its finest.It’s fascinating to think about where this pattern may lead in the future of but is it possible for anime to move from just being an entertainment form rooted in Japan to ruling the world, or will it fail to compete with lots of other types of entertainment as it goes international? Time will tell, but there definitely is growth here and we look forward to the anime industry looking into this option more seriously. It feels like, thanks to studios gradually trying new formats from various sources – manhwas, novels, and whatnot – we might be on the brink of a new era for anime that has something for everyone.As it is now evident, media changes constantly and the anime industry has a particular opportunity to reestablish itself to a whole new demographic that it has never targeted before. Perhaps some of the best ever novels and manhwas will turn into anime in the coming years, stories that ideally suited to anime and difficult to translate into live-action works. As of now, I am watching where anime industry is going.."
Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu,"TLDR: overrated and underwhelming anime. It's not terrible per se, it's just extremely uninteresting.Sadly this anime is very overrated, to a point I don't get why people were hyped at all.The best description for me is ""underwhelming"". Nothing is actually interesting past the first 2 episodes. Most fights in the second half involve characters you just met and have not attachment to, whatsoever.The most tensed episode is the last one... And it's just extra, unnecessary drama that brings nothing new to the story.The rest is either predictable, unnecessary or underwhelming. When a major death happens, the animation and direction makes it look like a slice...of life anime.The fights themselves are the best part, but are still unoriginal."
"Jitsu wa Ore, Saikyou deshita?","""Jitsu wa Ore, Saikyou deshita?"" (Am I Actually the Strongest?) attempts to stand out in the oversaturated isekai genre but falls flat in almost every aspect. What could have been an engaging story about a reincarnated protagonist seeking a peaceful life becomes a repetitive and poorly constructed narrative riddled with shallow characters, predictable plotlines, and uninspired action sequences.Uninspired CharactersOne of the anime's biggest flaws is its characters. Many seem to exist merely as placeholders, contributing nothing meaningful to the story. The prince and princess, for instance, are introduced but have no significant impact on the narrative. They’re just there, and their lack of depth or...purpose feels like a waste of screen time. The supporting cast as a whole is so underdeveloped that you struggle to care about their fates or motivations. Even the protagonist, while overpowered, lacks the charisma or complexity to carry the show on his own.Predictable and Shallow PlotThe premise of a protagonist striving for a peaceful life in another world is not new, but here it’s executed poorly. While the main character faces challenges, they’re laughably simple and resolved without any tension. Every conflict is met with an inevitable and effortless victory, removing any sense of stakes or excitement. Moreover, the show contradicts its own premise—rather than achieving a peaceful life, the protagonist is constantly dragged into conflicts, making it a frustrating experience for anyone seeking a ""relaxing"" isekai.Disappointing Fight SequencesFor an anime centered around an overpowered protagonist, you’d expect thrilling and well-choreographed fight scenes. Unfortunately, the battles are lackluster, uninspired, and poorly animated. They lack the energy and creativity needed to captivate the audience. Instead of grand spectacles or clever strategies, you get brief, anticlimactic resolutions that leave no lasting impression.Weak Storytelling and WorldbuildingThe story feels aimless and lacks cohesion. The worldbuilding is shallow, with minimal effort put into making the setting feel alive or unique. Important elements of the world are glossed over, leaving the audience with a generic, cookie-cutter fantasy backdrop. This lack of depth makes it difficult to become invested in the narrative or its characters.Awful Character DevelopmentCharacter development is virtually nonexistent. The protagonist doesn’t grow or face meaningful internal struggles, and the supporting characters remain one-dimensional throughout the series. Emotional moments feel forced, and relationships lack genuine chemistry, making it hard to care about any of the interactions.Conclusion""Jitsu wa Ore, Saikyou deshita?"" is a glaring example of missed potential. It fails to provide engaging storytelling, compelling characters, or exciting action—all staples of the isekai genre. If you’re looking for a relaxing or even mildly entertaining anime in another world, this is not the series for you. With its poor story, disappointing fight scenes, and lack of character development, it ultimately feels like a waste of time. Unless you’re a die-hard fan of the genre with no other options, this anime is best avoided."
Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru?,"Going into this show there should only really be one thing you expect from it. Its fetish content. meant to appeal to people who like watching cute girls workout with increasingly dangerous to play in public noises as they grunt their way through harder and harder routines. There's comedy here but lets be real that's not why you're watching. You're watching because you like these cute girls with back muscles, toned thighs, Abs, tight glutes and tans. If you like these things then you'll like the show that's all there is to it.Its fetish content for sure but goddamn if it ain't my fetish"
Dandadan,"People hyped this anime so much that I thought why not give it a try? I started watching it yesterday and in just two days, I’ve already completed eight episodes. The plot is well-written and I’m impressed. Nowadays, the quality of animation in anime seems to be declining but Dandadan anime has maintained excellent animation.The story is so interesting, and I enjoy Japanese ghost stories. It gives me the feeling of experiencing a fresh anime style. For a new anime, I think this is really good.I enjoy horror anime stories where the protagonist has to fight multiple ghosts or demons. I especially like...it when the protagonist inherits a new power. I like the group dynamic in this anime, though I feel it could use more characters to make the story even better. I hope we’ll see some new characters and more interesting plots."
Hoozuki no Reitetsu,"This anime, which supposedly blends mythology with comedy, completely failed to make me laugh. Instead of bursting into laughter, I found myself battling boredom throughout the episodes. It leaves me wondering how it managed to achieve such a high rating and glowing reviews on MyAnimeList.com. Honestly, I can't see how this could be considered an exceptional work, let alone a ""hidden gem,"" despite the term often appearing in its descriptions.Hoozuki no Reitetsu is a comedic anime set in a unique backdrop: Hell, as depicted in Japanese mythology. The story follows Hoozuki, the stoic and sardonic right-hand man of King Enma, who is tasked with overseeing...the smooth operation of Hell’s many departments.Despite the grim setting, the anime takes a humorous approach to Hoozuki’s daily life. From resolving conflicts between demons to managing tormented souls and interacting with mythological figures, Hoozuki remains unflappable, even in the most chaotic situations.The series blends elements of Japanese culture with dark humor, often drawing on historical, folkloric, and even modern references. While it’s praised for its originality and distinctive art style, its unique humor can be polarizing, depending on the viewer’s tastes."
Ranma ½,"For the first time I'm happy an anime has 161 episodes. I hate long stuff, exact why I'm not watching one piece. Even 24 episodes are a LOT sometimes. But when it comes to something I like I just can't enough of it. Ranma ½ comes under this category.I started watching the older version after finishing episode 7 of Ranma ½ (2024) cause I just needed more of this stuff. I actually like the older version quite a lot. Their annoyed or over exaggerated expressions seem more genuine here.I used to watch random episodes back in around 2012 or something when it aired on...Animax. Still loving it."
Wind Breaker,"6 episode in and you can already tell that this is good well for me I guess, the fights were so indearing and well choreographed the backstory of its character is good not overly dramatic and the comedy is great the interaction of the characters is fun, Sakura a tsundere male MC that actually work and almost every character were likeable for me that is important to enjoy a show and tune in and crave more for it overall a fun enjoyable delinquent anime that actually good when executed well and presented properly (looking at you Tokyo revengers)myanimelist really need have to be have...so long review i don't need to yapp anymore lol"
Sennen Joyuu,"Here's a nice movie with a basic plot told in the most interesting way possible. It's definitely style over substance, and I respect that, though I prefer something a little deeper. Like other Satoshi Kon movies, it blurs the line between reality and imagination in order to tell the story. The main draw of this movie is the imaginative way that the story is presented. We see the story of the actress's life presented through scenes from movies she's acted in. Compared to Paprika, Millenium Actress is a lot simpler to understand, since there isn't really that much that happens. It gets a bit repetitive...since the same life events get shown through many movies.The animation is decent. There aren't really any breathtaking sakuga bits, but nothing to complain about either. Due to the nature of the work, we can see many different settings presented, though they all kinda have a similar color palette and look to them, which is a bit of a missed opportunity. It does show it's age, as the colors don't look as vibrant as today's works.The music didn't stand out to me. Pretty forgettable.If we imagine that this movie is the documentary of this actress's life, it is a really beautiful way of presenting it. But her life could have been more interesting."
Dandadan,"Awkward, unfunny, and oddly sexual, Dandadan is a overall strange show involving the supernatural and beings from beyond with the emotional depth equivalent to a piece of paper and has the subtlety of a gasoline truck crashing to a firework building.Its art style is excellent and I loved all the backgrounds of the show along with the animation and color palettes, but the immature and gross sense of humor, and most of all, the constant need to dump exposition in your face and act like these characters are likable because of the audience getting a lore dump, really turns me off the show. Some will...like it, but I do not.More anime need to learn the value of patience. I had a similar problem with Demon Slayer. They throw so much at you episode 1 because they're so afraid you're going to turn off the show. You don't need all of your cards laid down immediately for me to love your show.I fell in love with Yu Yu Hakusho not because I had Yusuke's life story spilled out for me in 15 minutes, I fell in love because I SAW that his life was rough, and yet people who he thought didn't care for him still deeply cared for him when he died. I fell in love with Trigun because Vash the Stampede's character was slowly revealed through characterization quirks and decisions he made and things he did, so when we find out who he really is everything falls into place and it's all satisfying for the audience. So many anime now are so worried about people ignoring what's on screen, but in reality, I want to live through these moments with these characters, not get god awful lore dumps.I don't need to have glasses dude's sob story about being bullied spelled out to me all at once out of the blue to gather he was bullied. I don't need alt girl complaining about getting bullied for holding up her hand walking to school spelled out to me all at once out of the blue to know she's not that different from glasses dude. There's nothing wrong with these elements inherently, but I really, really did not like how it was all regurgitated in my face at once. It's such a forced way to get me to care about these characters and as a result I like them less.There's nothing wrong with exposition inherently, but here in this first episode they pay 0 attention to how it's handled. A little I wouldn't have minded, but it was communicated in the sloppiest, most uninteresting and forced way that I've seen in a long time.And the rest? Honestly, it didn't capture me. Again, good art style/animation but that's not enough for me to like it.No thanks."
Koi wa Futago de Warikirenai,"Love is Indivisible by Twins ends where it begins with little to no progression or variation and is not worth its watch time even for its drama. The main characters & their actions with the exception of Rumi somehow become insufferable as it continues and the only saving grace by the end was it's supporting cast with the exception of one.The Trio of MC's basically spend the entire 12 episodes saying & doing the exact same stuff with different coats of paint. If you reach the 4th episode you've basically experienced all 12 episodes with the exception of a few side characters that bring enjoyment...& relief to the viewing experience. Two of our MC's when conversing during the initial episodes and a few times in later episodes talk in references to culture & media in a way that's unnatural, overused and grating. By the end I was surprised that people found Naori the best girl when she spent a majority of the show being an instigator, possessive, manipulative, cruel and more, she also sexually assaults our MC while her sister who main problem was letting her insecurities get the better of her, asks for consent.Just don't waste your time and if you want to watch it, I highly suggest only watching until episode 4 and then skip to 11/12."
Murai no Koi,"(not native English speaker)Dont judge an anime by its animation, thats what I learne from watching many animes, and that statement applies to this anime very well.Many will probably be skeptical of the animation but its what makes the anime fun.Get past 4 episode and judge it all you want.(I wrote a really good review and while I was submitting it I got disconnected and lost it, it hurts more than my ex leaving me)I dont have the patience to write one of the same level, but I think it won't do justice for this anime if I don't write a review which may encourage...ppl to watch it. It deserves that.1. Animation:Slide show at its peak, really the 'fun' element of the anime.Dont judge it unless you completed it.10/102. Voice acting and sounds :VA is the best going for this anime and I am sure the jcstacff spent its budget on VA, and they did the right thing.Sounds are not spotify playlist adding level but good enough to make me enjoy the show.10/103. Chracters :Feels like home, side characters are not side characters, and overall really good10/104.opening and ending :Spotify playlist addition level, the ""bam, bam;"" part of the opening and also the "" menna wakataka ? ,, wakata'"" is really cute,Btw the opening song name is ""henshin"" if you cant find out it in Spotify the just type that in Japanese then you'll get it, quite underrated.10/105.story :Crisp, short and sweet. I wrote paragraphs before but I'll just summurise everything in one word, MASTERPIECE.10/10Overall 11/10 if possible, i really love it, its my opinion, its fine if you dont like mine.saiki.k and this are not of the same genre technically, but they both feel home, both have the same studio and I think thats not a coincidence.Ppl dont judge this anime by its animation. Watch it If you still dont like it then thats fine.I wanted this to be my small secret anime which only I enjoy, but thats not fair for this story or the author, i hope this becomes one of the most iconic romcoms."
Sengoku Youko: Yonaoshi Kyoudai-hen,"How to even put this into words it beyond me and probably will be for a long time as my heart tatters from the sheer emotion this anime has thrust into my being. The first episode didn't strike me as anything special, just kind of throws you into what you think is the middle of the story but I can tell you this much, for being Edo style anime, this show sure packs a punch in the face, the heart and the soul.Not many anime have struck me this hard in a long time, and by the time you get to ep 8, you...will most likely feel the weight of the world pushing down on you. I give this show a solid 10/10. It is truly a MASTERPIECE!"
Spy x Family Movie: Code: White,"If you enjoy the anime for the family dynamics, which is arguably the main ""catch"" for the series, the film will fall short.The art and technical aspects of the film are all good; the production is noticeably higher than that of the anime series.But certain plot elements are ridiculous to a degree even the TV chapters do not dare go.The main characters' powers are too convenient and overexaggerated in the movie to a point it's difficult to hold the same suspension of disbelief that the TV series managed to create.The plot sadly does not revolve around each character's unique traits and secrets (super spy, professional...assassin, telepathy), it just uses these traits for gags and plot convenience. Yor's final battle is cool, but adds nothing to the story. Loid wasn't on any particular secret mission, he just so happened to be in the right place and right time where WISE would then learn he was needed. They had to use the dog (mr. Bond) to make Anya advance two of the three most significant plot points (both very similar- Anya reads dog's mind, acts on it, and gets in trouble).The other plot point, the most natural and convincing if you follow the series (baking a cake for the principal) and which initially puts the story into motion, seems abandoned and pointless by the end of the movie.Had the story focused on this one element, instead of derailing into a stupid and random sudden military adventure, perhaps it would've made for a good film."
To LOVE-Ru Darkness,"My journey to discover this classic anime continues, and this time I've been blown away.I admit that while I enjoyed Motto To Love Ru a lot, I felt like there wasn't much left to the story. I wondered, ""How could they justify a third season that's split into two parts and even has OVAs?""...The truth is, To Love Ru Darkness has really surprised me. Suddenly, the story undergoes a very interesting maturation process. And you notice it from the opening where Momo is introduced as the main character.To Love Ru Darkness marks a significant turning point in the story. Firstly, it delves deeper into the...dark history of some characters, exploring their feelings and emotions.Secondly, and I would say more importantly, here we start to see how the plot, not only plays with erotic comedy moments, but also goes beyond, playing with fanservice and forbidden sex fantasies. I don't want to spoil too much, but the way the author plays with ""forbidden love"" is elegant, spectacular, and fun.At this point, I can say that I understand why the To Love Ru saga is a classic. And it's not just a silly ecchi comedy. To Love Ru plays with the viewers' emotions by presenting a vast array of perverse eroticism disguised as silly ecchi. This makes To Love Ru an incredibly addictive and fun work that truly elevates you to another level.Finally, I want to highlight the personality of Momo Deviluke, who at this point has become one of my favorite anime characters of all time.Now, on to the second part of this third season!THE GOOD. Clearly the characters have matured and the perspective of what is good or bad begins to fade in this third seasonTHE BAD. Rito seems to be the only character who doesn't matureI AM IN LOVE... Momo Deviluke is a cool girl!"
Fate/stay night Movie: Heaven's Feel - II. Lost Butterfly,"You'll enjoy this movie if you like fan service and good animation (although it only has one actual fight in the entirety of its 2 hour run). Shirou is as bland as always, somehow managing to unnecessarily make every single sound that comes out of his mouth some sort of shonen yell or scream, and combined with Sakura's naturally boring fanservice personality, this movie is triggering to watch.Sakura is horny and blushing in every single scene she's in and manages to say ""senpai"" in an oddly seducing manner at least 2 times for every minute of screentime that she has. Shirou is bland and...makes stupid choices but that's probably just the movie faithfully adapting the traits of a visual novel, which calls for a normal mc that players can project themselves onto and stupid decisions, but that doesn't change the fact that it makes the movie a less enjoyable experience.The heaven's feel route shouldn't have been adapted into an anime as it makes wayyyy more sense as a visual novel. Also, a lot of people say that the movies are too slow paced but it's actually the opposite. Unless you're familiar with the whole fate storyline, some moments can feel confusing, out of place, and/or sudden, which could've easily been cleared up if the movies took some time to explain them, but they're on a tight schedule trying to fit the entire heaven's feel route (which takes ~18 hours on the visual novel) into 3 movies. Nonetheless, it still makes the movie worse.Despite my criticism and overall negative experience of the movie, I would still recommend people to watch it since the animation and fights truly are top-tier and it provides audiences exposure to the nasuverse, which is one of Japan's best franchises."
Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 3rd Season,"So, I’ve also been watching Re:Zero, and it really isn’t my cup of tea. I hate the dialogue, and that’s 90% of the anime, so I think maybe I’ll just read the light novel instead. When it finishes, that is. it’s so boring. There’s just dialogue upon dialogue, and honestly, for a novel or manga, I could read a lot of dialogue, no problem, but not an anime. With anime, I expect animation and a lot action. And I’ll be honest, their dialogue is just plain boring. There doesn’t seem to be any stakes, when they’re doing the dialogue, it just feels like women gossiping....Except women gossip is probably a lot more interesting. This is just plain boring. They just talk and talk and I feel no tension, and out of nowhere someone just throws a line out of nowhere and you’re like, where did that come from? It just feels like their dialogues adds nothing to their characters, which are already so shallow. And I mean if it’s anime at least you can show what thoughts would be going on in their minds. But no, every character has to be as dumb and shallow as Emilia. She just wants to save everyone, she’s a Disney princess, and her knight in shiny armor, aka Subaru, will come save him. Except he’s just a sniveling little shit. I can’t believe how incredibly boring this series has become, where the first season was interesting as fuck, and shit was happening and that one music track that makes everyone sweat, now it’s just sunshine and roses and most of the focus is on the bland boring MC who’s basically just a shonen protagonist. So it only makes sense for me to give this up. It feels a lot like I’m watching the anime version of a VN, which I hate. I’d rather read a LN or a manga with a lot of text, but not this shit. I think that anime should remain anime. It shouldn’t become a talking fest, that this anime unfortunately has become. On top of that it has those weird degenerate things like loli, cat-girl that is actually a guy, guy acting like a girl, someone that things kissing = being pregnant (Emilia)."
"Tsuma, Shougakusei ni Naru.","I am waiting for this anime to be completed before I go through further.  So this is indeed a preliminary review, and I *will* be replacing it.But I have mixed feelings about this anime at the moment.On the plus side:  it's nothing like the X ""tourist"" crowd thinks it is.  This is not about sexualizing an elementary school girl.  In fact, so far, that's not even brought up, at all.  I imagine it might be addressed at some point, but so far, it's about as wholesome as you can get for the topic being an elementary school student being a...reincarnated wife.  If that's why you don't want to watch this, well, watch it.And I think it probably handles the topic of grief pretty realistically.  But what I don't like about it (so far) is that it handles the topic of grief pretty realistically.  An elementary school student shows up and says ""I'm your reincarnated wife/mom"", and instead of dealing with the situation as it is, the husband/daughter tries to reintegrate the girl into the family again - AS a wife/mother.  This can't end well.  I can't imagine any way in which this ends well. Add to this the fact that the girl has her own, somewhat abusive and neglectful mother, and, well...  things could get real.Whether or not the rating of this anime increases or greatly decreases will have absolutely everything to do with how they address this issue.I'm looking forward to finishing this anime, but I hope to all that's good and holy that they treat this sensitively, and don't go in the direction which I fear they might - that of the girl having to extricate herself from TWO abusive (for different reasons) families.I'm going to go mixed feelings for now, but that could tip over in one or the other direction as this anime finishes."
Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta?,"I tried to get through this whole thing.  I really did.  But I couldn't.  Sometimes you can't justify wasting that much time out of your life just to say you gave it a shot.I wanted to rate this anime a 3, but I gave it a 5 instead, and the only reason is that it was funny.  There was one scene that had such perfect comedic timing that I bust out laughing for a solid minute.  But everything else about this anime is trash.  Worse, it's not just trash, but it's depressing trash.The comedy was the only thing about...this anime I liked.  Now I will tell you why it probably deserved to be rated even lower than I did, but, well, saved by the laughs.There were two things about this anime that popped out at me.  One of them was a little thing, and the other was so much a structural thing that this anime couldn't be saved.First, the little thing.  The translations.  I watched through crunchyroll, and there were several places where the translation did not match what was actually being said, and it was clear that this was done in an attempt to integrate meme culture, like some of the more malicious localizers tend to do.  I won't state them here because that butts right up against the edge of a spoiler, but you'll probably (hopefully) know them when they see them.  Let's just say at least one of those translations, while defensible, actively ruined the tone of the scene.  This was the scene that made me laugh, and if the translation had been done more optimally, it would have been even funnier (""Onegaishimasu"" could be translated ""I'm begging you"" or maybe ""pretty please"" - if you know the scene, try using that with a little contextualization, and it changes the whole tone.)But that's a little thing.  The major issue with this anime is how it makes light of legitimate mental illness.  I'll say straight out that I didn't finish this anime, so maybe this was addressed later.  I somehow doubt it.One of the characters in this anime does not have the ability to tell the game world from reality.  The whole plot (and I don't consider this a spoiler) centers around the fact that this girl absolutely hates real life.  In some places she actually seems to want to completely give up on life.  She just hates life that much.  So she has retreated into a game world so hard that she legit can't tell when she's in the game world and when she's in reality (though sometimes it seems harder than others).This could be explored in a ""play it straight"" kind of way.  There's significant room for some actual, serious psychological exploration (as in ""sangatsu no lion"").  I think I would like to see a serious exploration of her journey towards healing (not one that just makes for awkward situations and cheap laughs).  Maybe see her backstory and understand how she got that way (and they might have done that later).  But they play it for laughs.  Ha ha mentally ill girl can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality, look at all the wacky hijinks that ensure, like assault, withdrawal, hyper-yandere behavior, ha ha, so funny.This is the same problem that some other very popular anime, like ""The Girl Next Door Spoils me Rotten"" and ""My Dress-Up Darling"" has - they make the main characters have serious psychological problems, play it off for fun, and it just ends up being a trivialization of a rather serious issue.  To this anime's credit, it at least takes it more seriously than those other two anime, which seem hell-bent on pretending mental illness doesn't exist, but it still feels as if this anime is just playing it for laughs.  I get that this may be the recipe for a popular anime amongst many otaku (though thankfully the ratings somewhat reflect this), but it's not for me.  In fact, it's just plain annoying.This is also something of an ""ecchi"" anime.  I don't like ecchi anime, but I can accept it if the ecchi elements are important to or further the plot in some ways.  That does not happen here.  All the girls have typically unrealistically huge, well, assets, and there is a lot of unnecessary focus on those assets (and their bouncing around), along with other parts, like thighs, butts, and, well...  pretty much anything that they can get away with.  I was prepared to put up with that for a good story, but, well, see above.  The bouncing breasts are about the pinnacle of what this anime has to offer.Also, there's something I just hate about all of these ""game"" anime - these four people were playing games together for a long time and all FIVE of them (yes, five) happened to be going to the same school?  What are the odds of that?  Oh, wait.  All SIX of them.  That's just getting ridiculous, truthfully.  I know the plot demands it but that's just beggaring belief.  Seriously?  That's enough to take me out of the suspension of disbelief right there.Art and music are fine, I guess.  I stopped caring.  Those are so unimportant to this anime that it wouldn't have really mattered.  I guess they did a very good job in drawing breasts.  As usual.Sometimes when I need to rate an anime,  I'll rate it ""mixed feelings"" because I feel like many people might like it even if I don't.  I can't do that here, even if it were true.  I don't have mixed feelings.  It's ""not recommended"".  The few (but high quality) laughs could not make up for the rest of this anime's structural deficiencies.  There are plenty more anime out there that are much more interesting and well written.  5 from me, and it can be thankful for that."
Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai.,"If only there's no cringe thing or maybe just a little cringe thing and if they are non-blood relatives, this anime gonna be so good. If that happen, i'm gonna put this to 8 or maybe 9?It's not normal about incest thing. How can people normalize this shit? Plus there's so many cringe scene. I can feel the cringe into my body, like maybe i can die because of that cringe thing.That my summary, acually it's good but because of those two things, i put this into 6.My suggestion to you all, if you hate incest and cringe thing, you don't need to watch it."
Poketoon (2024),"Incredible sequel to probably the best Pokemon spin off in recent memory.It may not have as much variety with it's animation style and art direction as the original Poketoon had, but it makes up for it with consistently gorgeous visuals and in my opinion, a more heartfelt story to most of the episodes.Eight episodes overall, four of them are wholesome, cutesy type of one minute short content, often in a music video format. While they're all well and good, it's the other four episodes where this series truly shines. A duration of about 10-17 minutes each, they all showcase a specific Pokemon (or...two) and their various relationships with their partner/friend/acquaintance. Themes of forgiveness, friendship, trust, etc, all cheesy themes when done poorly, but are executed very well here. You rarely see this sort of emotional depth in Pokemon, which is probably why it leaves such a big impact on the viewer, especially if you've been watching Pokemon for as long as I have (25 years).I hope to see a third season of Poketoon, and maybe a few more longer length episodes than previous seasons."
Golgo 13,"If you can get past the fact the first 30 minutes is just a soft core porn film. What awaits you is one of the best James Bond films I've ever seen.The action is a lot more bloody than what you'd expect from a Bond film. But the plot, characters and everything else would feel right at home especially in the more action focused modern era of Bond films.The entire movie looks beatiful, even the CGI bits look good and the intro was amazingly well done. Everything just looks fantastic, every character oozes personality in a way that modern computer aided animation just...no longer does. It also got a great soundtrack full of 80s era synths and blaring instruments that set the tone perfectly for every scene. Even the mandatory sex scenes are at least well scored if tedious to watch.I do have to dock points for how long it takes to get going, and the sheer amount of nudity is a little off putting at times. But its a solid film overall."
High School DxD,"This anime.... oh boy where to begin. This anime changed my life, I watched it for the first time with my 96 year old mother in her wheelchair, and started violently jerking off in front of my entire extended family, when the scene ended, my testistcles had became rasins, and it was everywhere, i thought the anime faded to white for a second, by that time, my entire family had left, but that night was the peak of my existence so be it human existance, this anime opened my eyes to the world of anime boobies and ect: doujinshi, ntr, hentai, furry inflation rule 34,...futanari, vore, genshin impact inflation futanari, guro. my mother (who is 96 and needs a breathing machine) got me the higschool dxd season 3 on blu-ray for christmas, i gave her in return the sweet release of death by shooting a load into her breathing tube. this series has brought together my family, and inspired me to give back to the ones i love. this is the best piece of cinema ever to grace the human race with its divine existance. Absolute cinema."
Katsute Mahou Shoujo to Aku wa Tekitai shiteita.,"It is an incomplete story as its creator passed away during its creation & it was made into an anime out of respect/passion.It lacks a satisfying ending and while it explores a lot, it lacks further clarification to its elements understandably due to the above.It features wholesome, cute and sweet moments & comedy between the two main leads with beautiful & incredible art/animation.It has dark humour between the wholesome sweetness that varies in severity.One review on here says that it is ""kid safe"" and I highly disagree as it features sexualisation, exploitation and assault by parties other than the two Main Characters & an unclear/questionable...age gap.Lastly each episode is about 10-12 minutes in length.Honestly, if you can overlook the ecchi/assault/exploitation, enjoy the magical girl & romcom genre and also want diabetes this is for you."
Sousou no Frieren,"The first episode made me think it was really slow and sad so I dropped it... but I'm glad I picked it up later to finish it. Kind of a slice of life, kind of a combat story, but somehow these two are perfectly blended together to create a masterpiece. The animation is top tier, the story is not generic at all and at times surprised me by not being typical and ohh the characters ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.  Excited to see more of this animation, it left me feeling good and intrigued and wanting to know more about this world."
Kimetsu no Yaiba: Hashira Geiko-hen,Ok so I do like this anime and I will watch the last season when it releases either way.I have to say I was a bit disappointed.There was just a lot of training and most of the action was in the last episode and then you are left on a cliffhanger.Although I understand that this will probably make the last season better or maybe I'm just being hopeful they got a lot of things out of the way in this season.But there was so little action.It was all just training it was a little boring to be honest.It was very dragged out but I feel...like the story just didn't do it for me like the other seasons.I wish they put more effort into the music it doesn't seem to fit the anime.
Sousou no Frieren,"Frieren is an animated series with good graphics, a slow but beautiful and pleasing rhythm. It is set in a magical world with a medieval aesthetic where different species (elves, humans, demons, beasts, etc.) coexist with roles and personalities similar to those of a role-playing game (RPG).The story begins with an original idea: the end of an epic journey that, much later, is what drives a new journey and evolution of a rather peculiar protagonist. This makes the whole story have numerous flashbacks that will introduce us to the different characters and the world around them.However, the slow and empty rhythm, especially at the beginning,...makes it lose much of what it gains from what was previously stated.The background of the story is motivational: Make the most of the moments lived with the people who accompany you above other rewards. The story is not very subtle in this sense and leaves hints of this in almost every episode.I'm a little nervous about the character construction, which, for my taste, is very stereotypical, simple and bland. They're either very good or they're harpies, or they're just killers, like demons, with no other motivation than to do evil. Most of the characters seem like simple NPCs that repeat behaviors without motivation or objective. No character is remarkable or particularly memorable, they just fulfill their function within the story and that's it.It almost feels like the positive reviews were created by gpt-4 bots. They just repeat the same thing over and over again that ""this series teaches you to value time with your loved ones"" when the characters are so flat and their interactions are so superficial  that that's not reflected at all.The world is basic and uninteresting, it's no different from any fantasy anime you can find out there. Its art style doesn't help either, it's pretty average nowadays.Anyway, watching this series is like playing a childish RPG but without the immersion of playing it. I don't understand how it's number one in almost all the rankings."
Noumin Kanren no Skill bakka Agetetara Nazeka Tsuyoku Natta.,"This belongs to my ""Minecraft let's play video"" category – an anime you can watch in the PiP mode while doing something else and not really miss out on anything that happens in the show.It's a regular Isekai, with all the standard Isekai attributes and plot twists. There are girls... They're really annoying. Well, that's classic. The hero is an Iron Man outside, but a pussy inside – that's also classic. The art is nice, the same goes for voice acting. The soundtrack – well, there IS a soundtrack... Ok? Given that the overall budget for this series was 2 bowls of rice and a...couple of Asahi beer cans – it's not that bad.Anyway, just watch it in the PiP mode."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"According to Equivalent Exchange, to gain something, you must give or lose something else in return. Well, if our world were also governed by a similar law, how costly it must have been for the writer to obtain the ability to conceive such a work. Magnificent series.Characters written with the pen of a novel, masterfully transported to a shonen. Complex, captivating, with very well marked and differentiated personalities and interests. All of them well thought out, created with love and respect for the story being told, from the most ""irrelevant"" secondary character to the short, blond, loud character who acts as the protagonist. Passing through...the hypnotic Roy Mustang, the incredibly charismatic Alphonse, and one of the things I liked the most (I imagine it is due to the fact that the writer is a woman): A cast of tremendously three-dimensional female characters, important and relevant to the story. They are far from acting as ""flowerpots.""Ed. Edward Elric. In my opinion, one of the best (if not the best) Shonen protagonists I have ever seen. He takes the typical characteristics of a protagonist of this type of stories, undoes them, mixes them again, and achieves a very deep character, with a clear objective and a marked sense of justice, but without that making you lose interest in him, on the contrary. He also has doubts, he has fears, he has weaknesses. Somehow, he manages to make you know that everything is going to turn out well when you see him, but at the same time you perceive his fragility. Sublime.The story flows like a calm river, it doesn't feel forced, nor rushed, nor lethargic. It always advances at its right and necessary pace. The characters forge and break their bonds, you get to know more about each one, since as I said at the beginning of the review, absolutely everyone has their moment to tell you their story.The emotional moments are VERY well done, without being exaggerated at all, they hit deep inside (at least, that's what happened to me).Perhaps, and not as a criticism, but as a mere comment, the fight scenes are what I liked least about the series. But not because they are not done (which they are) but because, honestly, they are what interested me the least of all. I was trapped from minute zero in what, in my opinion, is the best thing about this series: the development of its characters.A tremendously recommendable series, even for the most reluctant to anime. If you enjoy a good book, a good novel, you will enjoy this series."
Shinseiki Evangelion,"It is a classic 90s anime that needs no introduction, Neon Genesis Evangelion is a must watch for any anime fan and definitely a must, Neon Genesis Evangelion follows the story of Shinji Ikari who transferred over to nerv HQ where his father Works there, but shinji does have some issues with his father with by someCircumstances. While hesitant from piloting the eva at first he gets up and pilots Eva 1 to defeat Angel…… but that doses not stop there, there is more to this series than just the first 2 episodes.There are a ton of stuff that happens in this series and...even wild and crazy stuff that which I will not spoil.Overall this anime is a classic through and through it does have some flaws but it’s near perfect it will always be one of my favourite animes Of all time and still to this day 2 years after I’ve watched it back in 2022."
Hitoribocchi no Isekai Kouryaku,"Ok, so this is the first anime in my ""Minecraft let's play video"" category – an anime you can watch in the PiP mode while doing something else and not really miss out on anything that happens in the show.The art style is nice but the animation itself is mid. It's not like in Blue Lock S2 (nice looking frames with very little movement), but sometimes the animation is as lazy as just putting a static frame of a running character (yea, they're not running) and imitating the motion just by animating the dust layer and overlay on top of the character layer. The voice...acting is nice, the soundtrack is, well, it exists, kinda...The story is basically the opposite of what you see in the title, because... Khmm... I want this review to be spoiler free, so I'm just gonna say that when all is said and done the MC is very rarely alone, despite calling himself a ""true loner"".Anyway, if you're doing some routine work this anime is worth watching in the background. Especially, if you're a zoomer who's used to watching 3-4 brainrot videos simultaneously – for it'll be a piece of cake for sure!"
Migi to Dali,"I came across numerous clips and edits of this anime on social media, and I have to admit, the way these scenes were presented was incredibly intriguing and sparked my curiosity. However, when I decided to give the anime a try, my initial excitement quickly faded. After watching the first two episodes, I found them to be painfully dull and lacking in energy, to the point where I felt continuing would just be a waste of time. What disappointed me the most was the humor—something that could have been a highlight—falling completely flat, with jokes that failed to elicit even a chuckle. On top of...that, the pacing of the story felt awkward and inconsistent, making it unpleasant to watch and difficult to stay engaged with over time."
Bokura no Ame-iro Protocol,"The story is mediocre, the drama is forced, but this is still worth watching because of:1) Sawano Hiroyuki's opening – trust me, that OP is so good that you won't skip it even once.2) It has reasonable girls – they're not mentally unstable, they're not trying to jump onto the MC's dick, they don't behave like assholes.Ok, now, what might cringe you out is:1) The main antagonist – the typical ""I want to play around with the MC"" type, who evil (not so evil, though) just because...he's evil. He doesn't have any real motivation.2) MC's little sister – she's just so passive that it's annoying.3) Gameplay – those 90's Doom style walking and running animations are really cringe for a ""very popular and highly acclaimed"" shooter game that is worth of holding a tournament.So, my rating, including the personal bias, – 7/10."
Make Heroine ga Oosugiru!,"Being with losers is FunThe best thing about the enemy is the main characters dynamic with the blue hair girl, they work well together and are good foils to each other, it is also a very good looking anime.Nice placing of the camera so the scenes doesn't feel stale, the colours are also very unique to this anime and luckily not too bright, and just lighting on the character is very pretty.It is a very fun premise and in the first half of the show it is executed so well, but in the later half we get over to slice of life like normal school...anime, so it loses a lot of his charm, but the characters are strong enough so I don't quit.So fun to see the couples that actually got together, and how they feel like spoofs of other anime but they are done so well.Basically fun start,runs out gas of fast, but it's still entertaining enough to finish, but I hope the second season is gonna do more stuff, because this is just a fine experience."
Big Order (TV),"This was so bad I had to sign up and rate it. Comes from the same author as Mirai Nikki or Future Diary so I expected it to be a bit more like it, although I saw some similarities I can proudly conclude that this was much worse.The story had potential, however it turned out to be just plain terrible, it didn't make sense and was a complete mess by the end.Save your time for something better like staring into a wall.If you are wierd you may like it but I am wierd and I didn't.Thank you"
Tasogare Out Focus,"watched it with my partner - was catharticthere's a bunch of people bitching in the reviews, but this is actually good stuffnot everything has to be shakespeare -this is just your basic yaoi, gay dudes kiss and cuddle and stuffapparently, it's several manga from the same author that got stitched together -the end result is far better than one would expect,it actually works really well,you're swept from one short story to the next...so there's a bigger narrative at play, and every character gets explored : win-winthere's like three couples in this series,and the anime takes the time to focus on every one.however, all stories are interlinked.pros : gay dudes kissing and stuff, so romantic UwUcons : sexually speaking, the anime leans heavily into the 'top/bottom' narrative ... which is really unrealistic and stereotypicalThis is my first review, please forgive any mistakes."
Mob kara Hajimaru Tansaku Eiyuutan,"I put a lot of hope in this one after reading the manga but the anime is such a let down.I don't read the novel so I don't know which is more base on it but the manga is so much fun and a lot of laugh. In the anime all the fun part and laugh were gone, this just became plain loli adventure and I don't know the main point of it at all. Even the story is so different and not making any sense. (I need to read the novel soon.)I hope they just follow the manga, why rewrite the story if it...not making it better?"
Dandadan,"So far this is very enjoyable anime until the last episode, if the focus on soba eating sound keep continuing then I will have to drop this.I don't know why they have to focus on eating sound that much and it very annoy the hell out of me. It maybe their culture but it doesn't need to focus on that so much and it is not even funny.I have read the manga and I don't remember seeing any eating sfx text during the event, Gosh....But everything else is good, It follow the manga closely execpt some scenes that have to be changed and it make...them well. So, at least change this disgusting eating sound out please."
Enen no Shouboutai,"I am relatively new to anime, and while I was looking for something to watch, I found Fire Force. I liked the show for the most part, but there were things that felt weird and/or out of place.The story itself is a standard Shounen plot: the main character (Shinra) wants to become a hero and protect people. It is not anything special, but it works just fine. The power system is pretty interesting. There are 3 types of people: ones who don't have powers and can become infernal at any given time; people who can manipulate fire; and ones who can create it. It...is a cool power system, but nothing insane. My only complaint about it is that the power system provides lots of plot armor, as those who have powers can't become infernal.Both the animation and art style are amazing. No complaints there.The thing that bothers me the most about Fire Force are some of the incredibly annoying characters. Although that is mostly just my opinion.Personally, I also dislike the involvement of 'The Holy Sol Temple', which is the religion in the Fire Force. Basicaly, for an infernal (a transformed human) to be 'put to rest' (killed) a member of the temple needs to say a prayer. My problem is that a prayer is not needed to kill a regular human, which makes zero sense. The idea of the temple honestly feels really weird to me, as it's an obvious reference to real-life religion, but it's not really ment that way in the show—it's really more of a big organization and a lifestyle than an actual religion.All of that said, most of the characters are still pretty interesting, and as I already said, the graphics are really good. Other than a few obnoxious characters, Fire Force is a good watch. Don't really expect anything breathtaking, though."
Raise wa Tanin ga Ii,"It's ok if it's low budget, but I don't know what the point is for them when they choose the early art style of the manga but its ok, it's stylized and seems interesting, but idk I just feel bad....bad anime, bad designing, all ppt, everything is bad...But it's still ok when it cooks well  BUT-but  I got really disappoint BECAUSE they didn’t ask the author’s permission to allow the anime adaptation.As a manga reader, please, guys, read and support the manga!! especially if you get hooked! I know it's not for everyone, but for me, it’s true that the character’s romance development...is a little bit slow, but I really hooked up and it’s really fun to read! if you're a fan then please support the author!!"
Overlord Movie 3: Sei Oukoku-hen,"Overlord: The Sacred Kingdom delivers everything fans of the series sharp twists, complex characters, and moments that make you sit back and think. The story dives into the Roble Holy Kingdom’s desperate fight, giving new depth to characters like Remedios and Neia while keeping Ainz’s calculated plans at the heart of it all.The animation is top-notch, and the soundtrack hits every emotional beat. While the pacing in the first half feels a little rushed, the second half picks up with more action and clever storytelling. For fans of Overlord, this movie is a dark, gripping ride that fits perfectly into the series’ world. Definitely worth...watching!"
Seirei Gensouki 2,"What happened to this anime? This second season is just a waste of time so far.It is like MC is a completely different character. It is boring. A weak story line. All characters lack of personality. Things happen just because. Everything good from the first season just don't exist here. They just keep adding characters that don't really matter. The main storyline from season 1 just doesn't exist. It's not really going anywhere. He is just wandering around and chilling. A fight here and there.Animation also took a toll. It wasn't really good before, but now is just bad.7 episodes and nothing...really happened. I don't see why keep watching this. People should avoid this."
Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon,"This is by far the least comfortable watch in existence. When people say they think ""anime is weird"", they mean anything from this show. Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid feels like a scroll through R34 with all tags enabled. People keep mentioning the yuri baiting but the real problem is not really the yuri baiting. It's futa baiting. If you don't know what these terms mean, that means you definitely shouldn't watch this. This is deep into porn addict territory.I think I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to age gap stuff. But this show is definitely a no-no. For example, I usually forgive something like middle-school-child-crush-stuff...as long as the characters aren't sexualized. However, Riko's crush on Kanna will often tread into sexual territory. That's very uncomfortable.There's also a dragon woman with massive boobs that regularly flirts with a 9 year old boy. Great stuff. To keep myself sane for a long time, I tried to convince myself that it's just teasing. However, it slowly gets more and more sexual and it becomes apparent that she wants to sleep with a child. Nobody calls her out on this. Apparently they all think it's completely normal.Fafnir is basically a caricature of whoever enjoys this show. It seems they really know their audience because they made the most relatable character for them. My first instinct whenever he's on screen is to dissociate myself with him (in my head). When the show depicts him sitting in his room with magical girl figurines playing video games all day and not doing anything, I feel greasy.This show is a pressure test for how much degeneracy you can tolerate and it only gets worse in later seasons. If people manage to link this review to my real self, I am burning all my identity documents and living as a steppe nomad."
Kuroko no Basket,"Kuroko no Basket is an excellent anime! Starting with the players who are super badass both physically and in their playing styles! Especially for Kuroko:He is the most discreet player on the team, nicknamed the “Ghost Player”. With a smaller profile, he uses his “Misdirection” technique to distract his opponents. Kuroko considers himself Kagami’s shadow, his light and promises him to become the number one in Japan. It’s an excellent profile because being tall isn’t everything, especially in basketball.In addition, they evolve over the seasons to perfect their techniques and to always become stronger. This is probably one of the reasons I liked this anime....It’s the sports Nekketsu.The animation and the character design are very beautiful, very fluid and very dynamic. The matches are truly epic, even memorable, and are relatively short, not exceeding three episodes. In terms of the soundtrack, the openings, endings and OSTs are one of the biggest highlights of the anime. With a J-Rock style, they fit well with the atmosphere of the anime."
Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! 3,"THIS IS A SPOILER-FREE REVIEWKonosuba has had a very solid run so far: The first season introduced a loveable cast of characters witch great chemistry, the second one expanded on that and the movie was probably the funniest anime movie i have ever seen. After some time, we finally got a third season, but can the series still keep it´s momentum after all these years?Story – 8/10The story has actually improved a lot structure-wise. While seasons one and two mostly felt like an amalgamation of little mini-arcs, this season clearly splits between two arcs, probably the two light novels it is adapting. This felt like...a natural follow-up to the pattern we have seen before: After establishing all of our main characters earlier, the author now uses the longer arcs to lay focus on single characters, giving them huge chunks of character development. I really liked the first arc, set in the royal capital, a lot. Konosuba is still considered to be one of the most consistently funny shows in the seasonal anime cycle, and for good reason. The timing of the jokes is perfect, the new characters are a ton of fun and you can absolutely feel that the voice actors really gave it their all. Kazumas magical attacks are so unbelievably stupid, everything about his fighting style is just a joy to watch. The second arc of this season surprised me because it went with a slower, more emotional storyline that actually worked really well, because you can definitely take it seriously, even though the series never lets go of it´s inherently comedic nature. This still feels really fresh, especially for a third season!Art – 8/10I actually think the art has probably improved a bit since the beginning. A lot of these Isekai shows kind of always looks the same, and Konosuba is, for the most part, no exception. What sets this show apart from other members of it´s genre are the wide ranges of expressions our characters show. The visuals do soooo much for comedic timing, and make the jokes even funnier than before. I also think that the fights look pretty cool. While not being very dynamic, i think the effects animation is done really well, so is the CGI.Sound – 7/10This mostly consists of your typical Isekai OST. The OP is fantastic and catchy. When I saw it the first time, I was instantly pulled back into this shows unique and comedic atmosphere. The ED sounded weirdly nostalgic and was extremely funny. The sound design deserves extra praise here. Whoever had the idea to edit Kazumas voice during his magic chants deserves a huuuuge raise. I never laughed out that loud to a show in a long time.Characters – 8/10Kazuma still stands as one of the funniest protagonists ever. The whole crew has an amazing amount of chemistry and their banter is just a blast to hear every single time. Kazuma is still the standout in this season, however, the one who surprised me the most was actually Darkness. She gets a whole arc to herself, giving her some much needed development. The villains, although pretty generic, were a lot of fun as well. There is still room for improvement though: After Megumi got a lot of focus in the movie, Aqua is now the least developed character and it really shows. For the next season, I hope we get an Aqua arc to kinda even things out a bit.Enjoyment - 8/10This is one of the most consistently enjoyable shows. I will definitely watch all of the following seasons, and i really hope that this show continues longer, maybe even adapting the rest of the light novels which are already finished by this point. If you just want a good laugh and funny characters, this is the series for you!- Marco_YoooFINAL SCORE - 8/10"
Kidou Senshi Gundam 0080: Pocket no Naka no Sensou,"If Gundam 0079 is one of the most ""It actually is that good"" pieces of art ever made, then War in the Pocket is the reverse. Frankly did not care for this. I know exactly what it's going for. The entire look into the loss of childhood innocence and the naivety at which children look at war as just big epic battles not accounting the horror and loss of life. I appreciate it, I get it, and the darkly humorous final scene to nail it in is morbidly great. Unfortunately the whole thing is just a slog to sit through I'm afraid. What a shame...after the incredible opening sequence in the first episode. First Gundam miss for me since really trying to dive into it outside of randomly coming upon a series or whichever was airing at the time.Will be one of those things I admit to not liking as me and my family are about to drown in a flooding panic room."
Mecha-ude (TV),"This one gave me old-school anime vibes, and by old-school I don't mean the art, animation or the timeline- ""the old-school"" here means the anime story is very simple and straight. The opening song of the anime is great I highly recommend listening to that.It's a straight line simple story of those old animes (like -beyblade, pokemon) that we used to watch , almost as if the story is very predictable. But that does not necessarily mean it's not good. As far I am enjoying it, feeling really nostalgic to see similar story layout. [Short summary not a spoiler, skip this part and read the...next passage if you want to] MC finds a companion calling him from afar, in this case a mechanical talking arm, now people are behind him to utilize his power. As he and the mecha arm both are unaware of what they are capable of they are just going with the flow; saving anyone they see in danger and being friendly with everyone.This anime is neither overpowered nor strategic. There is no ulterior motive to learn here by watching this anime, only if you feel like getting back into old-plain anime stories can give it a watch or just leave it - you can decide that by watching the 2018 version of the anime. In 2018 the anime released a 25 minute duration advertisement episode, the same story they showed in episode 3 in this 2024 TV release; or you can use the anime's first 3 episode rule. After watching first 3 episodes you decide whether you want to watch it or not.OverallStory - midAction - goodArt - decentAnimation - goodI can not rate it precisely, since the anime is still ongoing and I did not watch it very far. After finishing the anime my rating may or may not change."
Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru,"Horrible. This has left such a deep scar on my psyche that I am reading the character names and I recognize none of them. This is like if someone incorporated all the cringe from all the harems into one show. The main character Eita gets blackmailed by Masuzu into a fake relationship. Masuzu uses a notebook that Eita wrote which contains his delusional fantasies. Gee I wonder where this is going. Mind you, I have not watched past episode 6, but I am pretty sure I can predict the ending.I feel bad for Eita because even though he accepts this proposal, this doesn't stop Masuzu...from reading his notebook anyways. As a viewer, your main emotion will be the second-hand embarrassment from watching this abuse unfold repeatedly.Your second source of misery will be Masuzu repeatedly doing JoJo references unironically. This is Masuzu telling you that you are currently watching a show so garbage that they have to do ""DAE KNOW JOJO HAHAHA ME TOO"". At this point, the correct move is to take the hint and watch a show that tries to tell a story or a joke, rather than reference one you might have seen.The subplots are weak and predictable. I stopped at the episode where Masuzu was starting to have some family trouble. However, this plot is so generic that I think that if I predict what happens next, my review will get removed for spoilers. Similarly, I am pretty sure I can spoil how the relationships develop without even watching what happens.The only thing I can forgive them for is that Eita is thankfully not the safe, polite harem protagonist. He is pretty close though. The rest of the cast are cliche. There is nothing else I can add regarding that."
"""Oshi no Ko""","Ah, yes, the showbiz. Everyone wants to be a star, everyone wants to be on top and be remembered for their talent, looks and/or personality. But the way to the top is steep, heavy, painful, and not at all fair. Will you betray your own self and become someone else to get to the top? Will you use likes and deception to make your way to glory and fame? This is Oshi no Ko. Story about lies, deception, and everything ugly about entertainment industry.It will be hard to review this anime without spoiling it, but I’ll try my best. The story follows famous idol named...Ai and her children. At the beginning, in the first episode, Ai travels to secluded town to have birthing secret because young idol giving birth Is very bad for her image and career. Gorou Amamiya, her doctor, who is also an Ai fan, dies the same day Ai is supposed to give birth and reincarnates as her son. Okay, I know that this sounds like isekai cliché bullshit, but hear me out. So anyways, Ai gives birth to twins Aqua and Ruby. Aqua, as I mentioned, is actually her doctor that reincarnated as her son, and Ruby his twin sister was as also reincarnated. She was a young girl and also a huge Ai fan who died from uncurable disease. And now, reincarnated as children of their favorite idol, and with memories of their past lives, they learn about their mother and how entertainment industry really works. When they become high school students, both get involved in entertainment industry, Ruby to follow her dream of being popular idol as her mother, and Aqua for his personal reasons.Okay, now. What makes this anime so special. It might look like some slice of life anime with reincarnation element, but it’s much deeper than that. The characters are great, they are really well made. Anime isn’t just one main story. It’s a combination of several stories taking place at the same time. You follow Ruby in her pursue of career as an idol and Aqua  and his personal quest to find answers hidden deep within the industry itself by using people around him to get himself on top and closer to his goal. Arima and Akane, two side characters that have deep background and different personal problems they are dealing with. They are complete opposite of each other. Karima is a former famous talented child actress. Her emotions and acting were considered one of a kind, but as she got older her popularity fell and she can’t find any new huge roles. So now she is scraping, so to say, in low budget dramas with amateurs to try and keep career alive. On the other side, we have Akane. Complete opposite. Also, a talented actress but with insecurity in her own abilities. Always thinking she isn’t good enough and that she needs to work harder. That’s puts a heavy burden on her, making her insecurities stronger. Both Arima and Akane are chasing the same goal but can’t stand each other’s presence and are in a way, respectful of one another. They realize their rival is a talented and respected actor and will take every opportunity to outshine them. This combination of different story is one of strong points in this anime and it’s what makes characters so loveable and interesting.Of course, everyone will tell you that first episode is the bomb. It’s by far the best episode. It’s an hour long, maybe even a bit too long, because in some parts you can feel that story isn’t progressing or that pace has slowed down significantly. But in the end, it really pays off. It sets up the plot in excellent way. I won’t spoil it, just trust me and give it a chance. And that’s where we come to pacing. After great first episode, next several episodes can feel a bit dragged and you feel like nothing is happening. It’s because the first episode delivers an amazing presentation and introduction to the series and after it can feel like excitement has dropped down by 90%.Oshi no Ko requires a bit of patience to get a momentum after first episode and it really pays off. If you are the type that requires that almost every episode is and emotional and eventful bomb, which I also personally prefer, that this anime might not be for you. But if you give it time, it will pay off.Animation is great considering the genre of anime. Most of times, for me, in drama animes, I don’t find animation that important. I will though, criticize it or praise if it sticks out. In this case, its great, Scenes where characters are acting or dancing on the stage are rly nice and fluid. Their movements and reactions are not stiff or unnatural. It shows the intention of the scene and it looks really good. Emotions on character faces are also really well done. When characters are sad, happy, frustrated, angry, depressed, the art style depicts that as it should. You can feel their emotions, which automatically makes character more likable.In drama and thrillers, you usually don’t prioritize action and flashy effects. You must focus on characters and narrative. And I think Oshi no ko does that pretty well combined with great animation and character design. Again, after first episode, pace slows down a bit, so if you are not very patient person, that might get you away from this show. It requires patience. If you have patience, you will end up with a great show that nicely depicts how entertainment industry is working, how young rising starts deal with stress, popularity, criticism, how it impacts their private lives and to what ends they must go just to keep themselves above water and what price they have to pay to stay relevant because entertainment industry can be rough and unforgivable."
Collar x Malice Movie: Deep Cover,"I really don’t know why the score is so low because I thought this was a pretty good movie and a very faithful adaptation. My only guess is that the few people that have watched it didn’t originally play the game and had no idea what was going on.StorySurprisingly it wasn’t an adaptation of the game’s story but more a side quest during said story. It made sense in the context of X day and wrapped its story accordingly. I was genuinely surprised of how it turned out since most of the visual novel adaptations that I’ve watched often want to do as many routes...as possible in 12 episodes which is impossible. So, what about this new story and X day case, was it good ? I would say yes, it was very much on par with what you could expect from the game, dare I say it was better than the events in unlimited (mostly Shiraishi’s route). The climax was great, everyone giving their all to catch the culprit and was very collar x malice like. In fact a lot of scenes had that collar x malice feel.ArtNot gonna sugar coat it, the animation wasn’t the greatest. The chara designs translated well into an animated form, which is amazing considering the level of detail of the style of hanamura sensei. But yeah animation mostly stiff and lazy, they had moments where they put in some effort but overall it is the weakest point of the movie.SoundThe fact that they took another visual kei group to make the opening and endings, akin to plastic tree for the games, was awesome and definitely fits the vibe. Sound design was great too and the osts were great too. Fitted the vibe too. Now as for the voice action, Ichika’s va did great, her voice was Ichika even if she is undubbed in the games, it just felt natural. They brought Konishi into the mix and he was great, as were the other guys.CharactersThis new character was very interesting, keeping the theme of justice of the whole game. Everyone was also handled with care. They didn’t act out of character, unlike some vn adaptations. They all had their moment to shine. Just a nitpick, Sasazuka didn’t get as much screentime as the others but that’s just me. The relationship between Ichika and Yanagi was as sweet as ever and I’m glad he was the main love interest for the movieEnjoymentObviously, as my review reeks of subjectivity, I enjoyed the movie. Maybe the search for it for more than a year was also to blame for how hyped I was when I finally found it.OverallThis is a product made for the fans, for the ones that have played all the routes of the first game. I cannot stress enough that if you’re new to the series don’t watch it. It literally spoils who the lead of the terrrorists is, the one that is revealed in the last secret route, at the last chapter."
Nisekoi,"Ok, here is the thing.You have an harem with:-Donkan male lead, magime, straightforward.Waifus:-Kitoge, lead waifu, violent cute tsundere.-Kosaki, wafu Bijin hasukashi.-Tsugumi, an unrealistic mary sue.-Marika, a schemy yandere that shows later on....-Maiko, Shuu, techincally a sidekick really, special mention because this one managed to be entertaining at times.Nothing strange here.The premise is kind of creative thou, family circumstances forces the two leads into a fake relationship, this gives the show it's name. it's really a flavor kind of thing and the series evolves as expected.So why to see this stuff in 2024 then? well it's because the Shaft magic tricks. Shaft here performs for what probably will be remember. Long history short, this series is about classic Shaft stuff.You should try this just to see if Shaft manages charm you in any way. Else drop it.The source material is a real mess, and it's not worth for your time.Cheers!"
Kussetsu,"Pretty good but also pretty bad adaptation.The story is essentially original as it's not part of the original VN. The story being changed or converted when adapting a VN is not weird, like in Kanojo x Kanojo x Kanojo, Aneimo2 or Resort Boin, to say some of my all time favorites that changed the story to make it more cinematic. In this case, the situation we see in the OVA is not impossible though, it's more like it didn't had the chance to happen.The characters are pretty much the same and don't feel any incongruences between the original VN and the original story for the...OVA, only the main heroine had her villainism buffed and the protagonist may or may not have different motivations (it depends on perspective).The animation is soft and fluid, it's comfortable to look at and aged pretty well... Except for the scenes when they shadowed the characters in an already dark location to add more ""mystery/drama"" to the scene, that looks awful.A problem in specific I have (more like a thorn than anything else) is the mix of flashback/flashforward story telling they use, I FREAKING HATE THAT. Showing the end and then saying ""And this is how it happened"" is something I hate and always will.The story, animation and scene direction are pretty good, only the the jumping between before and after is bad."
Nisekoi:,"It's such powerful punch to pass trough the ep 12 and hit next and.. wow! surprisingly there is nothing more there... that was the END?It's totally truncated, knowing that probably was an ongoing source at the moment, and difficult to work with, i mean, it's shonen jump, but... that was really bad.I don't know what to do with this score honestly, because, the adaptation, what shaft did with this, it was actually good, period.It's a power shortage kind of ending.Oh almost forgot about this, if you notice the oddity of Kosaki's imouto just spawning out of nothing into the show, it's because of...the rolling waifu release of the source material. That gives you an appropriate snapshot of.... you know..."
Keijo!!!!!!!!,"This anime will change your life. I'm blasting multiple fat ropes at my computer screen.To get to the point of my review, I would say that this anime is the antithesis to all anime and that it will make you rethink the entirety of any sort of anime trope that you will see on modern television. In short, this is something I believe that everyone can watch this show and get something out of it, whether its education, fan service, or togetherness, there is something here for everyone!My favorite character, Kawai Hanabi, truly lives up to her name! She is incredibly kawaii and makes...my heart go doki doki, heh. But in all seriousness, the way the world is built around these strong independent young ladies makes my head spin with anticipation for what will come next. Who will win? Who will lose? Well, in any case, there are neither winners or losers in Keijo!!!!!!!!!! there are only the friends we've made along the way."
Kimi ni Todoke 3rd Season,"Season 3 of Kimi ni Todoke is basically the reason why I enjoy watching NTR.Kazehaya having a nothingburger dilemma that causes drama/tension in their relationship, which is then instantly resolved is utterly pointless that it's actually worse than watching filler.There is no real reason to focus on Kazehaya and Sawako anymore. In fact, this whole season could have easily just diverted full attention to Sawako's two other friends and it would have been much better than whatever unnecessarily long detour of a season this was.In fact, Kazehaya getting NTR'd by Pin would have been enjoyable to watch while he soyboys in the corner."
Mushoku Tensei: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu,"I don't watch much of isekai. This, however, is a truly masterpiece. It has the refreshing story that deviates from the cliche story line of others. The story is really good with quite a fast tempo. The high fantasy world is just nice, not too corny and the class structure is well explained.Some people gave bad reviews because they do not like the ""immoral"" behavior of the protagonist. They think this anime should not be recommended because it shows a boy with a 40-year old memory from previous life is having sex with a 15 year-old girl in medieval era and that is gross. The...same people probably recommended anime that involve killing human, satan worshiping and killing one own parent, and these are okay to them."
Rekishi ni Nokoru Akujo ni Naru zo,"Bad.The anime's proposal is no longer very innovative, at least it should do a solid job with the proposal presented, however everything is executed in the most boring way in the world, the universe is not captivating and no character has charisma, it is cloying how superficial and artificial everything is.The protagonist should have some charisma, some relevant personality trait, but she also fits as a secondary character, since she does not have any deep development.The ""romance"" is the worst thing I've ever seen, the romance scenes are totally unnecessary and add absolutely nothing to the plot, except to disgust the viewers.The ""heroine"" is another...character without salt and no development, with the charisma of a Renault Kwid.Everything in this universe is bad, generic and poorly used, just an anime to try to make some money, stay away."
D4 Princess,"This is an okay anime from the early 2000s.  It's one of those anime with cute girls that's mostly a comedy but gets somewhat dark towards the end.  This was actually a trend in the 2000s, there were a lot of anime that did that, although even as far as anime with those endings are concerned this anime isn't insanely dark at the end just more so than it was prior to the final 2-3 episodes, which isn't really saying much.  The  plot revolves around Doris Ruridou, a young princess who had just entered Teito Academy. She is also a Panzer,...a person with special abilities and fights with a weapon called a ""tool"". Shortly after entering, her older sister shows up to teach her how to fight as a Panzer against other Panzers who challenge her.  And that's basically all there is too it.  It is what it says on the tin.  What you see is what you get.  And it was fine, but nothing special in my opinion.  I do have to say, while I don't normally comment on this, the ending theme song is an absolute bop.  Yes, the ending, not the opening.  Also each episode in this anime is less than 10 minutes long, so even though it's 24 episodes long, it won't take you that long to get through it."
Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu 2nd Season,"Not as consistently good as the first season, but the highs are definitely a lot higher and ends on pretty much the perfect note. Many romance shows tend to go down the path of dumb misunderstandings and melodrama, while this one manages to mostly avoid all that while delivering on probably the most satisfying conclusions I've seen in a romance series in a while.There are a couple episodes in this season that kind of feel filler-ish, but each one does at least manage to slip in a reminder of how much Ichikawa has grown and developed since the start. I also found myself actually...laughing a lot more at the comedy in this season. I did notice some QUALITY moments too where it felt like the characters were pretty off model, but I can forgive it since it looks great during the moments where it matters most. I also appreciated that some of the side characters got a lot more screentime, especially Ichikawa's sister.Great show. Gave me diabetes. Might actually check out the manga since apparently there isn't close to enough content for a 3rd season anytime soon."
Shi Cao Lao Long Bei Guan Yi E Long Zhi Ming,"I really enjoyed this story about a herbivorous dragon misunderstood as some great evil dragon. My favorite part of the whole show was the relationship between the two main characters, which I found surprisingly deep and touching given the nature of the show (a cute comedy). The dragon is a funny character - mistaken for strong but actually weak, the opposite of some characters from other shows that have the opposite dynamic. Kind of reminded me of Angel Densetsu. I really grew to like Ling Zi over time, even though in the beginning she was a bit over the top.The episodes are pretty short, but...I thoroughly enjoyed them and am watching the second season now!I thought the art style was pretty nice. Not the best or worst animation I've seen."
Megami no Café Terrace 2nd Season,"The Café Terrace and Its Goddesses Season 2 has a lot going for it, but it also has a handful of things that play against it too.  I'll assume you've seen Season 1 for the purposes of this review.Story & Characters: Let's start with the strengths, many of which continue from Season 1.  The storytelling is still quite strong.  The first arc focuses around a competing café, known as Family.  It features a rival owner who hires five girls to run the café for him.  There is a minor problem this posses, as it's not the most use of character...design - each girl resembles and shares characteristics with the current cast.  Leaving that out, I actually enjoyed the storyline with that setting quite a bit.  It posses a serious problem for Hayato and company and, while it's still a little goofy, they go about their business in trying to find a way to coexist with this new crew.  Expanding the setting can only be a good thing considering how much time is spent in Familia anyway.One character that really starts to shine is Ami.  You may recall that each girl got their own mini-arc in Season 1, but Ami did not receive the same benefit.  And, like the others in Season 1, it was pretty well told.  Much of Ami's character is about this weird, over-the-top girl who always seems so carefree, but introducing a serious problem for her fleshed her out so much more.  This actually was really good timing, because you can see her finally develop as a character, especially when you consider the finale.  She was great here.  This isn't to say the rest of the crew didn't develop either.  The other four were still really well represented, though some got more screentime than others.  Shiragiku and Akane might have the least here and I'd like to see the two of them developed more if this series were to continue.As the series carried on, I felt like the second half started to get slightly dull in terms of exciting material.  This isn't to say an attempt to continue strong storytelling didn't continue because it remained different.  I just didn't think it was quite as interesting.  If you liked the weird and over-the-top stuff from before, then you'll still find it here.  This, along with the excessive fan service, were probably my least favourite parts of this series, but the latter was at least a little more held back than before.Aside the new Family cast, there weren't a ton new characters to really sink your teeth into, but at the same time, you don't really need to.  There's enough story elements with our current cast that I didn't feel more than a handful of additional minor characters were necessary, and they delivered that here.  Hayato, for the most part, remains the same person as before, which I enjoyed for the most part.  You can clearly tell that he's starting to feel pressure about who he likes most out of the five girls and if this series were to continue, I hope he starts to form more of a connection with someone.  (Story: 7/10, Characters: 8/10)Art: The series looks more or less the same as the previous season, but in terms of shine and terrible censoring.  (9/10)Sound: I don't have a ton to add here, as everything sounded fine.  The OP wasn't nearly as iconic as the first season's, but that's a minor gripe at best.  (7/10)Overall: The Café Terrace and Its Goddesses Season 2 continued to be an entertaining series, even if started to taper off in the second half of the season.  Audiences happy with the first season should still enjoy this series and it continues to do right by its characters, which should have been the goal with such a large main cast.  If it were to continue, there are things I'd definitely want to see, especially after the developments of the finale, but I'd check it out to feed my curiosity.  (7/10)"
Jitsu wa Watashi wa,"My Monster Secret (Jitsu wa Watashi wa)Rating: 8/10Every once in a while, you come across a rom-com that doesn’t just make you laugh but also warms your heart. My Monster Secret is exactly that—a delightful mix of supernatural chaos, endearing characters, and wholesome romance that kept me smiling from start to finish. It’s quirky, it’s funny, and most importantly, it’s unapologetically sincere.The Premise: Refreshingly AbsurdThe story follows Asahi Kuromine, an ordinary high schooler with a not-so-ordinary problem: he’s terrible at keeping secrets. When he discovers that his crush, Youko Shiragami, is actually a vampire, he promises to protect her secret. But things don’t stay simple...for long as more supernatural shenanigans (and secrets) pile on.It’s the kind of premise that sets the stage for hilarity and heartache in equal measure. The blend of romance, comedy, and supernatural elements gives the show a unique flavor, and it doesn’t take itself too seriously, which works perfectly in its favor.What Made It Shine for MeThe Characters Are Lovable Weirdos:The heart of My Monster Secret lies in its characters. Shiragami is the kind of heroine you can’t help but root for—sweet, awkward, and deeply loyal. Asahi, meanwhile, is an absolute gem of a protagonist. Sure, he’s clumsy and a little clueless, but his sincerity and determination make him incredibly endearing.And then there’s the rest of the cast. From alien principals to devilishly mischievous childhood friends, every character brings something fun and unexpected to the table. They’re exaggerated, yes, but in a way that feels deliberate and charming rather than over-the-top.The Comedy Hits the Mark:I genuinely laughed out loud multiple times while watching this. The humor is ridiculous but never feels forced. Whether it’s Asahi’s panicked attempts to keep multiple secrets under wraps or the wild antics of his supernatural classmates, the show knows how to keep things light and hilarious.Romance With Heart:Beneath all the chaos, there’s a genuinely sweet romance at the core of the story. Asahi and Shiragami’s relationship develops naturally, with plenty of cute, awkward moments that make you want to cheer them on. It’s wholesome without being saccharine, and that balance is what makes it so satisfying.A Unique Take on the Supernatural Genre:Unlike most supernatural shows that focus on action or drama, My Monster Secret leans into its comedic side. It uses its fantastical elements not to create tension but to amplify the absurdity of everyday high school life. It’s a refreshing twist that makes the show stand out.Where It Could Have Been BetterPredictable at Times:As much as I enjoyed it, the story doesn’t stray too far from the rom-com formula. You can usually see where things are headed, even if the journey there is fun.Pacing Issues:Some episodes feel like they drag on a bit, especially when the focus shifts away from the main couple. The humor and side stories are enjoyable, but they occasionally overstay their welcome.Lack of Depth in Some Characters:While the main cast is well-developed, a few of the side characters feel more like running gags than fully fleshed-out individuals. It’s not a huge deal, but it does make certain moments feel repetitive.How It Felt Watching ItHonestly, My Monster Secret was pure joy. It’s the kind of show that doesn’t try to be anything more than what it is—a lighthearted, feel-good rom-com with a supernatural twist. It reminded me why I love anime’s ability to mix genres in such unexpected and delightful ways.Watching it felt like hanging out with an eccentric group of friends: chaotic, unpredictable, but always fun. There were moments that made me laugh out loud, moments that made me go “aww,” and even a few moments that surprised me with their sincerity.Why I Gave It an 8/10This anime deserves an 8/10 because it does exactly what it sets out to do—and does it well. It’s not trying to be groundbreaking or profound; it just wants to make you laugh, warm your heart, and maybe remind you that even the weirdest of us deserve love and acceptance. And for me, it absolutely succeeded.Would I Recommend It?If you’re in the mood for a rom-com that’s equal parts silly and sweet, My Monster Secret is an easy recommendation. It’s perfect for fans of shows like Rosario + Vampire or Nisekoi but with a more comedic and less fanservice-heavy vibe.Just don’t expect anything too serious—this is a show best enjoyed with a relaxed mind and a sense of humor. If you can roll with its absurdity, you’re in for a great time.Reviewer’s Rating: 8"
"Clannad: After Story - Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, Kyou-hen","Great episode. The Clannad series had very flat and boring heroines. However, I am glad to see that this episode gives more character to Kyou and Ryou. Sunohara is still a bro. Tomoya acted a bit out of character in this episode, but it's understandable why. I appreciate that the plot they started got resolved. I usually hate how love triangles lead to long term awkwardness, but this one lasts one episode so I found it enjoyable.Better than the original Clannad, not as good as the climaxes in After Story.This is some text filler because for some reason I am supposed to write an...essay for a single episode, which I won't for obvious reasons. Please stop reading this review because there is nothing else."
Hitoribocchi no Isekai Kouryaku,"The other anime about the Most Notorious Yapper running concurrently with this one made me raise my ranking. I basically experienced shock therapy by watching the worst fantasy anime ever. I then came crawling back to the average Isekais, begging them to let me back in. Loner in Another World is just a standard Isekai (so far) and maybe very, very slightly better.The title is (thankfully) misleading because even though the MC is a loner, for most of the show he isn't alone. I'm kind of glad this is the case because I did not want to watch 12 episodes of a dude thinking to...himself and monologuing about his amazing sicko mode MMORPG playthrough. I'm also glad the show understands its place and doesn't take itself TOO seriously.The opening theme is pretty good. The story was weak at the start, but is average enough to be entertaining after a few episodes. The characters are not that interesting, but they aren't insufferable either. The animation is average. The plot is slightly above average so far because after 8 episodes, I am looking forward to where it goes. The opening is pretty good.Overall, pretty average. I recommend because even though it's average, it did not hurt to watch and by the end I was pretty entertained. McDonalds isn't that tasty nor is it healthy but I never regret eating it. Same here."
Blue Lock vs. U-20 Japan,"What they did to my favorite manga is absolutely nuts. One of the main points of Blue Lock is getting into the Flow state, yet this adaptation is literally the opposite of flow. The animation makes me want to bleach my eyes. I could recreate the entire 14 episodes in PowerPoint using screenshots taken every 5 seconds, and it would literally own this garbage of anime.The pacing is also all over the place. While the manga has its own pacing issues, it’s quadbilliontrillionmillionbillion times better than this vomit of a product. The art style, which is so dynamic and energetic in the manga, feels lifeless...here, failing to capture the intensity and psychological depth of the story.Please go read the manga—it delivers an infinitely better experience. Shame on 8bit for this.  🤢🤮 🤢🤮 🤢🤮 🤢🤮 🤢🤮 🤢🤮 🤢🤮 🤢🤮 🤢🤮 🤢🤮 🤢🤮 🤢🤮 🤢🤮 🤢🤮 🤢🤮 🤢🤮 🤢🤮 Literally made me cry how ass it was..."
Maougun Saikyou no Majutsushi wa Ningen datta,"A decent Anime. It's about a Human who is pretending to be a demon in the service of the Dark Lord as they wage war against humanity.You can clearly see that it's a low budget anime. The animation is not great, the writing is infantile and the story is all over the place. They also frequently pad up the runtime with unnecessarily long interactions that only serve to annoy the viewer. The first half of the Anime is rife with it.The main problem is that the anime doesn't know what it wants to be. There are episodes of nonstop combat, ""tactics"" and grandstanding....And then there are lighthearted romcom episodes that feel like fillers. The protagonist is surrounded by silly comic relief characters whenever literally everyone else in the world acts seriously. It can be really jarring at times, especially the ""rivals in romance"".The anime really shines I'd say in the last two episodes. It's finally taking itself seriously and delivers a relatively good battle without too many unnecessary distractions. There is a promise of a sequel as well. I guess.Overall for what I assume is a very low budget production I'd rate it at 6.5/10As I finished writing this I just realized that this isn't even an ISEKAI. What the hell. I hate it now."
Shoujo☆Kageki Revue Starlight,"My view of this anime is not impressive at all, throughout the episode when I watched this anime there was always a question in my mind, namely ""what is this anime about? What is the relationship between martial arts competitions and musical dramas?"" I can't understand the concept of this anime story. In this story, 8 girls compete in a musical drama but what is strange is that the competition is done by competing with weapons such as swords, sticks, and arrows while fighting they also lecture each other about their respective egos. This is the first time I have found the meaning of musical...drama will shift very far from its original meaning in this anime.., if you think you can find a spectacular and inspiring musical performance in this anime, you should bury that desire deep down because there is no musical performance in this anime so the music genre is wrong if it is attached to this anime. Then about the drama performance, this is also something I didn't find in this story because as I explained earlier, these 8 girls practice singing, dancing, and acting but instead compete in a strange way, namely fighting using swords and other weapons.  So about the competition that each character tries to win to become a starlight has nothing to do with musical ability, dancing or cleverness in acting in drama, but rather by being good at using weapons and giving lectures to influence the opponent's mind, then it is certain that you can win the competition. And at the end of this anime episode, all the strange competitions that the characters do along with the polemics of each character are only to determine who the main role is in the drama performance entitled starlight.?! A strange way for a role audition in a drama. Instead of showing a strong story in terms of music and performing arts, it only shows an abstract and ambiguous concept that does not meet any of the criteria for the anime genre.For the animation it is quite good and for the soundtrack, there is nothing memorable about the backsound.So the conclusion for this anime is that I cannot recommend it, it is better to try another anime with a similar story concept but a deeper introduction to performing arts or music. Thank you"
Space☆Dandy,"So much wasted potential, baby.Space Dandy has stunning art and animation, fun and vibrant characters and an interesting world. And it chooses to do very little with all of it. Space Dandy draws parallels with Cowboy Bebop but falls short of it on every metric.The less serious tone of the show trades character development and emotional punch for shallow jokes and simple gags. Episode 5, in which Dandy escorts a young girl, reveals the show is capable of such depth but chooses not to do so often.A lack of overarching story leads to a very episodic show. This isn't necessarily bad, but since...the characters of the show are almost one dimensional, there is very little feeling of development via story or character growth.The nonsensical plot and lack of consequences to the main characters cuts almost all the tension in the episodes. Seeing them getting blown up at the end of a scene doesn't mean they die, have lasting consequences or even acknowledge  the event at the start of the next scene.What carries this show is the beautiful art and animation. The galaxy explored is full of unique shapes, colours, and and creatures all wrapped up in a cool retro futuristic style . It is a seriously groovy experience that alone makes this show worth watching.The action can also be done quite well,  showcased best in episode 7's space race. Space Dandy's own take on redline,  the episode takes itself seriously. Packed full of action and style, is had me on my seat for the whole length of it. Unfortunately other action scenes in the show tend to be hampered by the bizarre comedic tone that portrays Dandy as an ineffective hero.Despite my criticisms, Space Dandy was still a fun watch. Just go in with low expectations and enjoy the ride, baby!"
Kaguya-hime no Monogatari,"Kaguya-hime was Isao Takahata-san's last film before he died. After watching most of them, I arrived at Kaguya-hime when it arrived in cinemas in Sweden. Loving his previous films under Ghibli's banner, I had immense expectations, and I fully enjoyed the very special occasion.Going by the experience of the film, it felt like a 9/10. However, after the film ended I was seized by how masterly everything was forged and put together. In the same way I can't deny how ""Fanny & Alexander"" is a 10/10 classic (you just have to surrender flat), I can't deny Kaguya-hime. The music, the artstyle, the story, how they...tell it. Everything about this film makes it clear: It is an absolute Japanese masterpiece.Rest in piece Isao Takahata. Ghibli will never be complete without you.(This review was posted for my own sake without any ambitions.)"
Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu,"My issue with Re Zero is that it's way too unrealistic.The guy gets thrown into a dangerous world of constant death, and discovers that every time he dies, he leaps back in time. And the way he reacts... it's just surreal. Almost immediately, he starts adapting and trying to help his friends. He just catches onto things way too fast. How is he even supposed to be relatable?I mean, sure, he screws up a lot at first, but the speed with which he starts catching on is nothing short of unbelievable. How did this guy even end up becoming a NEET in his...previous life? Was he a NEET by choice? I can't imagine it being otherwise.I have autism. World is complex to me. The constant deluge of information is relentlessly chaotic for me to keep up with. Life just doesn't come naturally to autists. I have strategies for dealing with this. I make lists. I wrap a blanket around me and put on lo-fi music. Sure, everybody has their chaotic moments where they take a break from things and dabble in their hobbies away from everyone else, but I'm trying to say that life just doesn't come as naturally to autists. It just does not.This is why Re Zero is inaccessible to me. Had what happened to Subaru happened to me, I’d probably spend years in useless bouts of denial, and every time I returned by death, I would ask ""Did I just die?""— and I wouldn't be able to believe that I just did, and I'd gaslight myself into thinking that I was just daydreaming. Because it wouldn't make sense to me. I'd be sure I was imagining things up. How does he get it after just a few times?The characters? Okay, yeah. Emilia is...fine? Maybe? Like, she’s potato-adjacent, but at least she’s a nice potato. And Rem? Designed to appeal to otaku, for sure. Reinhard? He's cool.Maybe this show's story doesn’t have the conceptual weight of Higurashi or the cleverness of Steins;Gate or the raw ambition of Full Metal Daemon Muramasa in deconstructing character ego or the fluidity of Summertime Render or the memorability of Mushoku Tensei. But there’s something kind of fascinating about it anyway. It's like what if universe was designed by a rationalist and we could keep retrying life or if life was a video game made by Fromsoft. It's something that makes me feel like maybe I’m the problem. Like,  the reason I don’t love it isn’t that it’s bad, it's very good, but that I wouldn’t survive in its world."
Monster,"Easily a 10/10. I have to be honest, it gets a little boring in the middle, but if you push through a little bit, it can lead up into something  pretty interesting. Despite that, this anime still sits in my top 10 anime because it is that good. I'm actually quiet surprised that an anime this good can stay this quiet for so long. I have never seen it made an appearence anywhere except on MAL's top tier. The story is so exciting. My jaw dropped almost in every episode, especially towards the end of the series. Honestly my jaw may as well be...glued to the floor HAHA. There are so many twists and surpriseing things happening in the story.  If you're love crime themed movies and not prone to gore and blood, I highly reccomend this one."
Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! 3,"Konosuba has always been regarded as a series known for it's overusage of cheap jokes, X ammount of lewd references and turning what seems to be a serious problem at first, into a whole circus. Kazuma is your egotistical and perverted friend who keeps running his mouth, Aqua is a lazy bastard who's only good to create chaos, Megumin, despite her small structure, knows no boundaries when it comes to making BIG nuclear mushroom clouds and Darkness would do everything if it meant pain, a tier above Kazuma's perverted acts. Add all these ingredients and you've got a formula for a show that racked up...a lot of praises within the anime community, making it one of the top shows recommended to beginners. It had been 7 years since season 2 premiered. We'd gotten a very satisfying movie and a series dedicated on Megumin..but it never felt complete; we needed more Konosuba.And now that's here, i'm not sure what to feel about it. It doesn't feel like the Konosuba i've grown to appreciate. What once was a mindless trashtalking series, now has grown some sort of..character able to have feelings, to think on its own rationally.This season felt like 2 movies. One, focused about the adventures with Iris, the princess of Belzberg, that also manages to add a few relevant plot points for the future; and the other movie focused on Darkness having to pay a debt because of some issues of her own. That structure becomes a problem because in every movie i've watched, you always have to add some connection between the characters and the person watching: being relatable. There's still nonsense thrown around don't get me wrong but, at times it feels quite forced as if they're being silly for the sake of catering to the theme's show, you can feel that towards the latter stages of the season.And as a result of that, Megumin and Darkness had their ""chip"" replaced. Megumin appears to have a crush on Kazuma, she acts way more ""lovey-dovey"" towards him instead of her ""scum of the earth"" approach she used to have. Darkness aswell appears the same way, the masochism is no longer her entire character because of the whole series dedicating time to her feelings and overall background of her life. This in turn results in less potential of jokes between the two and, Aqua replacing them 2 as being the only one useless in the party.Konosuba relies on its characters foolishness to achieve its memorable moments. Once you take away part of what makes them great, it loses appeal. The episodes went by so fast without me ever cracking a laugh. Felt predictable and some scenes were unecessary. It doesn't help some characters didn't have any screentime like Wiz or Yunyun that can add some silly story in the mix.I've always heard: if it ain't broke, don't fix it! You can see the people who worked on this series gave it their best(voice acting, animation) there's no complaints there but; i question whether this change in character behaviour will pay off in the future. It's watchable but it will never feel memorable as the last 2 seasons, at least to me."
Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Movie,"Help My Girlfriend Is A DemonThis was the movie that told me that jujutsu kaisen could actually be entertaining all the way through without the feeling that it was like a saw and just kept going up and down.Story engaging, characters lovable goof balls that are unique, just the theme and The Journey,fights were so entertaining and gorgeously animatedIt cannot be understated how important the rule of cool is for the show, if it was just a little more cringe like Demon Slayer than it would not work, but it is cool and it shows me cool stuff, So my brain does not question...any of it.It's a Small Part in a big narrative, It works as a self-contained story and that is a feed for a movie like this."
Kage no Jitsuryokusha ni Naritakute!,"This anime's cover provoked me for months since appeared on a main page of MAL, it's just another situation when recommendation system simply doesn't work.What, another isekai anime with tags Action, Comedy, Fantasy and people call it a 'parody on isekai genre itself'? Sounds nice, for sure it must be pretty funny and original, right? I mean, there are Konosuba, Isekai Ojisan and Isekai Bishoujo Juniku Ojisan already as great examples of comedy parody on isekai and they were pretty fresh in its ways of resolving standard isekai situations.Forget about it, Kage no Jitsuryokusha ni Naritakute! is just a bad joke which repeated...hundreds of times with an idiotic stubbornness. How is it a parody on isekai if it's keep being so serious and pretentious in terms of plot and characters' motives? Obviously it's not a parody on isekai, author of this abomination is just pathetic and insecure so decided to use excuses for his cringe worth writing skills by including silly scenes everywhere so it would look like as a total farce and circus what could help with avoiding of critics which traditionally follows anything barely serious and plot oriented.Half of this garbage anime try hard to be a comedy. Oh, it's a parody on a comedy then! Okay, then author did a good job since made a lot of unfunny jokes and put in some random delusional fool instead as MC. Another half of anime is a mess full of lengthy boring battles and basic formal dialogues. Oh, it's a parody on meaningful anime then! Okay, then author did a good job again by making worthless incoherent plot which fails to intrigue.There is nothing to discuss here in terms of details or plot moves since all of them are meaningless and tasteless just like the author himself. I don't care how this anime looks and sounds, how much money were spent and who voices who here. It's just another  'popular TM' trash with some group of fanatics which can't do anything better than spread lies about 'parody' premise in this anime. This parody on anime itself totally deserves its parody-tier 'fans', what a joke."
Ookami to Koushinryou: Merchant Meets the Wise Wolf,"What a great anime, gentlemen, I came looking for copper and I found gold, I came with the idea that it was a normal isekai but I was wrong, the story is great, it's almost like Frieren but magic is changed for economy, Holo is a very well written character Now I understand why it is so popular, I thought that later she would become submissive to the protagonist but she has her character, I also love that this anime is not cliché in any way and that there is no harem, the female characters that appear are very interesting and the best thing is...that they don't fall in love with the protagonist because yes, the soundtrack is spectacular.I recommend it people, see Spice and Wolf, it's wonderful.10/10"
Zom 100: Zombie ni Naru made ni Shitai 100 no Koto,"Oh man, this show was horrible bruh, I can't even recommend this show to anyone after episode 2, like just let it end bruh, this is sooooooo embarassing to watch. The cast does not behave like they're in a zombie apocalypse, they behave like they are in a december vacation! I can only blame the youtube shorts that I saw but in fact it's not really the shorts that drawn me in, it was the black company in japan and insane work philosophy that employees have to endure to earn their check. This made me think the show was good at first(good real life premise,...relatable as f), when in fact the writing for the show is so bad that it can't carry the show at all.Was the story unique? In the beginning, yes, but afterwards it is just weeird, bruh. Best friend decide it's better to go naked than to wear something that zombies can't bite through your skin.Do I think the artstyle is fitting for the story? Ehh it's alright, sometimes the woman has cute looks, other times it look like it turned into a comedy show.Were the characters well-rounded? Well everyone is stupid except for Miss Risk Analyzer but overall I can't, bruh, I can't continue watching.Did the characters react to situations and events in a realistic way? NO THEY DIDN'T, GOD LEFT. GOD LEFT BECAUSE HE BEGIN TO QUESTION THEIR INTELLIGENCE.Do you think others will enjoy/dislike this series, even if you didn't? Why?No, I mean if they are really bored, they might enjoy it, other wise, they are just delusional. Sure, the females are hot, but that's it, there's no well-written romance. There's no life and death situation which brings them closer, no. It's about ME, ME, ME, the MC itself."
Blue Archive the Animation,"Gacha adaptations… Gacha adaptations… Goddamn Gacha adaptations… Where do I begin with this one? Gacha adaptations are the most infamous adaptations in the industry. They’re the type of shows that clearly have no idea how to set up their stories. Either they tried too hard to connect with their source materials or they’re just lazy promotions for said materials. Blue Archive is clearly a victim of this. This sparks a lot of red flags regarding how it promotes the game itself that you might really consider thinking if the anime even tried or if you just want to play the game instead. Quite the series...we have here, huh? But tell me, the OPs and EDs are promising so you may think this show would at least be a tolerable one, don’t you- Absolutely not, and I would guarantee to tell why this series fails in a lot of fundamental aspects.What is Blue Archive about? This series is about Sensei (yes, he’s called that, he doesn’t really have an official name unless you consider our usernames in the game) who is hired to be… you guessed it, a teacher. His job is to take care of the schools in a world we call “Kivotos”. In this scenario, though, this show is at least based on the Countermeasures Committee arc. Shiroko found Sensei lying around on the ground in the town and thought it would be a good idea to have him as the teacher of a forbidden school named “Abydos”. Abydos is a shell of what it was before because as of currently, it doesn’t have any students other than the Foreclosure Task Force which consists of Shiroko, Serika, Ayane, Nonomi, and Hoshino. They want Sensei to stay around for longer because not only do they want to keep the school they study in healthy but there’s also danger involved. Blue Archive’s premises are interesting because unlike other school anime whether they have fantasy involved or not, there’s always initial tension involved and each of the story ideas tells us the creation and mystery of each relevant school. Sadly, however, this won’t last for long.Before I get into how the anime is directed, let me briefly explain Volume 1 of the game first. I’m personally not a fan of Volume 1 (and the game’s storytelling in general). While they do have nice build-ups, they feel a little too stagnant for what they are. They rely a little too much on slice-of-life aspects and as much as I’m a fan of SoL, they tend to get in the way of the story’s progression. Hell, even if we get to the serious parts, the story tends to take itself too seriously. It tries too hard to express the personal struggle of each character but most of it either felt forced or doesn’t matter. It also has symbolism which is actually damn awesome but in the end, it’s rendered as more of a concept than an actual connection to the story. With all of this being said, this right here is an anime adaptation we’re talking about. You would think that even with just 12 episodes, it should at least decently address the problems of volume 1 in the game, right? To that, I answer, HELL NO. In fact, the series does the opposite. Even for non-BA standards, the anime disrespected what the game really offered and it’s really painful to look at.The direction is the biggest cause of this show. While the direction in the game is still mediocre at best, it at least stayed true to how it connects with the story. This one, on the other hand, misses the whole point of what the story in the game aims for. It even misses the point of what Sensei is. More on that later. But you get what I mean here. The directing is the cause of why the pacing is so problematic in the first place. Cutting out the prologue is the biggest mistake this show has ever made. The prologue actually shows us how Sensei roams around Kivotos while also building his responsibilities as a teacher. We see how Sensei meets his students. We see how he takes care of his students. We see how danger is set up. Heck, we even see the mysteries set around the world. We don’t see ALL OF THIS in the show. It’s as if the show thought the first few minutes of volume 1 was the true start. On the surface, this doesn’t seem so bad. But if you had played the game before, you would have realized that this is not how we start the story. There are a lot of unanswered questions involved and this is our first encounter.Hell, even ignoring how this show cuts out the prologue for no reason, the directing is still bad. We have a lot of cool and strong shit from the game. We have the halos which play a very crucial role in the story. We have the origins of Kivotos. We have the mysterious evil leaking in Kivotos. We have Sensei’s credit card. We even have heavy lore revolving around the characters. You wanna know what the show did? While most of those are present here, none of them actually play a role while other stuff like the credit card is left out. Why? It’s because the show treats Blue Archive as a slice-of-life romcom with action as a superficial aspect (again, more on said aspect later) instead of what the game is even about. This is not Lycoris Recoil. This show shouldn’t really be doing any of this. It has a lot of things that are in the game and it still didn’t even try to use any of it alongside the absence of the prologue on top of it. If you’re wondering how nothing happens when someone gets shot by a gun even after finishing the show, I wouldn’t blame you. This is a massive problem we’re facing and it’s only spreading from here.The halos aren’t really explained here. They’re really just there for aesthetic purposes while students are invincible to gunshots. This show either forces us to play the game to discover how it works or it purposely reduces that factor into plot armor. Like I said, it doesn’t end here. The show contradicts the story by shoving in a lot of slice-of-life and comedy aspects to “cover” the unanswered chaos involved. While the game still overuses those aspects, those treatments are even worse here. The show really doesn’t know what it tries to aim for. It just seems like it wants to be like the generic seasonals we see before. It plays too safe with its setup. It doesn’t want to expand more on serious stuff. It’s not funny. It’s how it is. By the way, I mentioned how symbolism in Blue Archive is relatively underused in the game. It’s a good time to point out that it’s not present here and… that’s also really a massive problem. I can forgive the game for rendering symbolism as concepts even if it degrades the writing. But leaving them out is a horrible thing, even worse than cutting out the prologue because they’re used to show us what the mysteries are.Lastly, the fight scenes are garbage. Some may consider this as a nitpick and that’s totally understandable. But I just can’t stress to you how negatively it affects the show. The choreography is complete nonsense. Characters resolve each problem in each fight by asspulls, such asspulls as removing hardcore consequences the moment students are about to win or students are motivated by Sensei’s weak-ass words just because. There is something really off with the choreography. We’re not given enough time to see how students fight. We spend the rest of the time seeing characters do surface-level stuff. They don’t really show how they fight effectively. We just see characters winning by either random luck of their own or elements of surprise. The show is too afraid to hurt its own characters because of those problems. Hell, we can ignore the horrible fight scenes and this glaring problem is still presented. Even Hoshino, who sacrificed herself to save the Foreclosure Taskforce, is given a treatment that is not harsh enough.Let’s move on to the cast, consisting of Sensei the main teacher, Shiroko the bank robber, Serika the tsundere cat, Ayane the table flipper, Nonomi the sunflower with a minigun, and Hoshino the unstabled uncle. The main girls aren’t really much to speak of, even in the game. They have no personality other than being based on one character trait. Yeah, they do their own purpose but that’s really about it. Nothing to say here because they aren’t really worth more than a few sentences individually. The same can be said with the side cast. They have a role for each but they don’t do much. None of these characters are close to being impactful. They’re too straightforward and they don’t express much besides their cookie-cutter expressions. Yeah, we have the famous Aru shock face meme presented but most of the time, they’re really just plot devices to move the plot forward.But no other character comes close to being a problem child as the Sensei in this show. He is, without question the worst part of this godforsaken adaptation ever. Sensei in the game was actually a character of his own. He’s mature, he’s independent, and he sets up his own responsibilities. While I still don’t think he’s that great of a character, everything he does in the game is at least understandable. In the anime, you get none of that. He’s reduced to being a generic harem protagonist who’s afraid of certain things for no reason. He really has nothing to show. He’s just there because the anime really needed a teacher around. Think about it, he’s a living contradiction to the story. He clearly has no idea what he does as a teacher. He only does his job because his students really need to succeed. While that is understandable by itself, he’s brainless because he mostly follows his own students just to keep his job going instead of actually taking care of his own responsibilities alone for once. Seriously, I really want to punch him in the face.The animation in this is bland. It’s stiff. It looks like it was made by middle schoolers who recently discovered Twitter. The character designs, anime or game, are a massive hit-or-miss. While they at least fit with each character, most of the time, they still look generic and aren’t really my cup of tea. The soundtrack, minus the OP and ED both of which are fine, is deplorable. From a generous perspective, this is the biggest crime in the show minus the absences of the prologue and the symbolism as well as the flanderization of Sensei. The music is outright amateur and doesn’t fit well with Blue Archive at all. The voice acting is good, though. Hoshino’s voice actress really went all out with her character.It’s a shame with how the anime went and the anime is a shame itself. Really, though, it manages to miss the whole point of what Blue Archive is. Listen, I personally don’t like Blue Archive in general but I can still see how it’s written. This show is a spit in the face in how it “promotes” the game. It’s yet another generic example of how fundamentally flawed Gacha adaptations are. Just look at Arknights for a moment. Sure, it’s not very amazing but the story in there is still pretty good and manages to connect with the game well. Blue Archive’s anime cannot do the same. It tries too hard to be its own thing when it messes with what the game offers. Let’s hope that if it were to have a sequel that adapts volume 2, it would at least avoid the problems this anime has. But I highly doubt it would happen."
Shoushimin Series,"SHOUSHIMIN completed 8.62/10""we r just arrogant high schoolers""P U R E - P E R F E C T I O NI was originally gonna start this review with this (when I started ep 9)""I am gonna first talk about the thing I HATE ABOUT THIS SHOW, is that it's suppose to be ordinary, and  how many people hated the  'filler' eps those were my best eps, as that is what it's suppose to symbolize and not this whole ass  hard core criminal storyline, cuz this then just turns into child detetvie trope, detection q, conan, kindaichi etc""...But after completing ep 9, my heart went steady again, and I was proved wrong, that NO, THEIR IS NOT A SINGLE THING WRONG WITH THIS ANIME, not ONEWith the quote above(start of the review) , it made it clear that the show is, was and will be ABOUT CHASING THE ORDINARY as stated in the titleI was hoping for something hyouka esqueI got something diff completely which just shows yonesawa's writing capabilities, his these two works r WORLDS APARTComing to the worldSo. Much filling and vibrance in a world which is exactly empty,I have seen shows, post covid prods which visibly become empty, desolate, this show, literally.

Great Pretender,"A very very good 6. I would recommend it for the thrilling contained heists but dont be surprised if you find yourself wanting to drop.It took me many years to finish this (i watched the first part on netflix then time kept getting away from me after the second part released).The animation, overall story, music, etc is all top notch, but the conman plans in each arc are fun as an arc but I didnt feel like the overall story was moving forward (kinda like detective conan or other long running shows) EXCEPT for the growing feeling that the mc was being used. This...cycle kept making me lose interest over the years and only watch a few episodes at a time.This feeling was brought to a head at the end and it feels like some pretty big narrative swings were about to be taken until collapsing back into same ol same ol safe conclusions.I think the first two con heists are really fun, but as a whole the show should have shrunk its run time and been more brave with the ending."
Zhan Shen: Fanchen Shenyu,"one of the best Chinese anime I've ever watched. While the story may not be entirely unique, it still manages to deliver an engaging narrative that fits well within the genre. For fans of action and fantasy setups, the plot is enjoyable, even if some elements feel familiar or predictable.The art style and animation are the standout features of this series. The ""god-like"" animation brings the battles to life with stunning visuals, making every fight scene feel epic and intense. The detailed character designs and vibrant backgrounds add depth to the world, perfectly complementing the grandiose theme of gods and mythical beings.In terms of characters,...they are well-rounded for the most part. Each has their own strengths and flaws, which make them relatable and believable. While some characters might feel overly powerful or idealized, their reactions to situations are grounded enough to keep the story immersive.If you're someone who enjoys beautifully animated fight scenes and well-executed action, this series is a must-watch. Even if the plot doesn't break new ground, the visual spectacle and intense moments are more than enough to keep viewers entertained. Fans of the genre will likely appreciate it, while newcomers might find it a good introduction to the world of Chinese anime."
Uzumaki,"What a shame. After all those years of waiting for a good adaptation of one of the most famous manga created by Junji Ito, we got a show that is, at best, strongly mediocre.It's a shame, really. Episode 1 was brilliant, after all. Simply beautiful artsy art, smooth animation, great direction that suceeded in building up the atmosphere of uncanyness and mysteriousness... Everything was polished; everything felt top-notch. And then episode 2 was released. A huge quality drop in every aspect, mostly when it comes to animation and direction. I'm tolerant and used to quality drops in long-running series, but come on - Uzumaki anime...consists only of four episodes, not four hundred. And yet, its second episode was not only painful to watch, but also upsetting, given how good its predecessor looked like. Heck, even the overall tone of this adaptation seemed to change for the worse. Like I said before, I'm pretty tolerant when it comes to that kind of things in anime, so me finding such radical change simply unacceptable and pathetic really makes one think about the intensity of the lack of quality that the discussed thing has.This anime is faithful to the source material, even if it has some modifications or omissions here and there, which is normal for an animated adaptation of an illustrated series. Too bad that at the same time most of the episodes are simply badly animated. They leave a bad impression, make the whole experience rather unpleasant, and if mixed with rather mediocre direction (too chaotic at times, mostly on the aforementioned ep. 2, but appearing also on episodes 3 and 4).The only elements that I can't tell anything negative about are those related to the audio side of this series, I mean voice acting and music. The latter is something you'd expect from watching an anime. The voice acting industry in Japan has a lot of very talented and skilled voice actors, after all. As for the latter element, while the soundtrack isn't groundbreaking, it i well-executed and, along with the strong voice acting, helps to mitigate the impact of the poor animation in some scenes, making them slightly more bearable to watch.Uzumaki anime will surely not be forgotten in the future, after the season during which Uzumaki anime had its premiere ends (Fall 2024). Though, in this case, it's not a compliment. It's better to be forgotten than to be mentioned as an example of one of the biggest anime disappointments of the 2020s decade."
Dandadan,"Honestly I didn't expect much when I started watching this anime but to my surprise it exceeded my expectations completely. Considering a lot of new gen anime tend to be pretty generic or bland this one really stands out in some aspects.The first few episodes even though they were enjoyable did not impress me in any way since the Mc looked pretty boring (the usual nerd boy that eventually gets super strong) and Ayase (the popular girl that magically falls in love with the school nerd) looked like a generic tsundere character. The story didn't seem like it was going anywhere but it was still...interesting to watch because of the unexpected things happening.However after the first 3 episodes the anime starts going in a different direction. The story starts getting more serious among the funny comic scenes.The villains in this anime are just great, even tho the concept is similar to JJK  I feel like it is done in a much better way, since they got clear ideals, a good backstory and characterization.The animation looked weird at first, I couldn't tell if it was bad or it was just a different style, but I actually got to like it a lot. It looks really fluid and nice to watch.The music is great, especially the opening that is really catchy.Overall this anime is really outstanding and if it stays this consistent till the end it will definitely become a big title in the anime community."
"Kekkon suru tte, Hontou desu ka","If TLC made an anime, 365 Days to the Wedding would be it. It has such a goofy premise to begin with, but the execution makes it even more ridiculous. I'm only 3 episodes in and I feel like I've watched an entire series because of how much happens in it. Yes this anime from a critical perspective is horrible, but that does not mean it's not enjoyable to watch.There's not much to comment on artwork, sound and animation. It's at the standard for anime nowadays. Characters however? I have a few things to say. Rika and Takuya are fine main characters. They won't be...your favorite and they definitely won't be mine. These are two blank slates surrounded by a bunch of mostly energetic people who have a lot more personality than they do. It does make for some interesting moments with side characters, and I don't hate the trope. But Kama (yes, the cat) is easily the best character in the show.Back to the plot, like I said it's silly. Sometimes it gets a little too out there though. It's a rom-com but some of the things that happen are just so ridiculous that it creates plot holes at times. The co-workers also feel ridiculously stupid solely for the plots convivence. I won't spoil anything, but you'll know what I mean if you watch it. Overall, it's just one of those shows you that shouldn't look past the surface for. It's not going to be for everyone."
Serial Experiments Lain,"This show is really weird and kind of difficult to watch because it's so abstract to a point where it feels like a nonsensical mess sometimes. That being said it's the kind of media that sticks with you  long after you finish watching it, and it'll make you remember it, leaving a surprising impact as you take a moment to step back and look at the internet from the outside.Most shows are designed to be entertaining but this is more focused on it's message. I could go on about it all but a lot of it has already been said by countless reviews and...video essays.My main take away is the importance of the human body. It is part of who we are and protects us against evil. We must not confuse the digital with that of the real world as making that separation puts us in danger of losing ourselves.It's kind of all over the place sometimes but I'll give credit where it's due. It sure is interesting. If you're looking for an anime unlike anything else, this is definitely that."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"At first, I didn’t expect much from this anime. In fact, I didn’t know what to anticipate beyond a vague memory that it would involve some comedy and romance—something I barely recalled when I added it to my playlist years ago.If you enjoy works like Daily Lives of High School Boys or Beelzebub, this anime is definitely for you. These titles share the same bold and exaggerated humor that defined much of the 2000s and 2010s. But beyond delivering a highly entertaining comedy, the show also introduces a subdued yet captivating romance between the main characters.What truly stands out, however, is how the anime portrays...the lives of those living under the Arakawa Bridge. At first glance, these characters seem like absurdly over-the-top caricatures created purely to fuel the show’s humor. But as the story unfolds, you begin to realize that each of them is there for a reason. They’re individuals deeply disconnected from Japanese society, each carrying their own struggles. Some have no intention of fitting into societal norms; they simply want to live freely, unshackled by the rules of conventional life. This is particularly evident in how they completely disregard the protagonist’s wealth, as if money holds no meaning to them.As for negatives, some viewers might find the character development lacking, especially since the protagonist tends to react to the other bridge residents in the same way throughout. However, there is subtle growth, though in a series like this, dramatic changes might actually detract from the humor. Additionally, the romantic moments, while present, are few and far between.That said, this anime is absolutely worth giving a chance for its humor, its unique take on societal outcasts, and the charm of its unconventional storytelling."
Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui!,"I never laughed when watching Nichijew, I cried (in boredom) watching Azumanga Do'h, I watched Daily lives of High School Boys stone faced as the minutes of my NEET life faded away watching unfunny shit. But Watamote changed that, this is the first anime I've genuinely ever found funny, this is the first anime in existance to do Japanese humour well. This anime will literally change your life.Then again I want this anime to remain obscure and not be tainted by pleb shits who watch 0IQ unfunny stuff like Dandandan or like Vinland Saga...hey if you liked Vinland Saga don't watch Watamote, it's not for...you, infact it really sucks11!!11 Go back to your wannabe seinen shounen crap Vikings my ass they never existed and Vinland (and in extension Northwestern Europe) does not exist."
Serial Experiments Lain,"Anime is a great medium of artistry to be displayed. The reason a lot of people venture into anime, including myself, is to be creatively driven or emotionally moved. With the growing age of modern animes, a lot of the older, less novel animes tend to get pushed into obscurity, especially to the eyes of newest consumers of the market. For the average new-gen consumer, even animes in the 2000s seem to be considered old. There are exceptions to this old-new phenomenon. For example, shonens like Naruto, Bleach, Dragon Ball, One Piece, etc, and certified classics like Cowboy Bebop or Neon Genesis: Evangelion are some...on the list. Serial Experiments Lain is a sci-fi mystery drama that can be easily swept under the mountain of sci-fi and mystery animes.Or so you would think...Look at this review from the angle of a newer generation of anime enthusiast. After getting used integrated with anime, the consumer watches the basic ""normie"" animes. Then, they gets bored due to the oversaturation of well-animated action animes. So they delve deeper to find something, anything to give their mind a break from the monotony. After scrolling, they find a bunch of people talk and praise an 1998 anime called Serial Experiments Lain. They look into its history, seeing its prevalence among anime reviewers and MyAnimeList. So after waking up at early hours, they binge the entire series.I know this very well, as this is my perspective.And I would watch it for the first time ever again and again and again.Instead of going piece by piece, I will go into what I think makes Lain so great.- - - - Storytelling - - - -To understand Lain is to understand philosophical principles. Theology, mental illness, loneliness, purpose, all ideas that wrap into Lain in a wonderfully projected package. To unwrap it is similar to completing a game. Constantly going through small things all to lead up to the main objective. The main objective is always in sight but is not achievable until all the small things are completed. The small things can satisfy, but the main objective is one that the player knows will give them the most satisfaction. In my watching experience, Lain is confusing to start and weird to just pick up out of nowhere. But personally, I love that. Its not the kind of confusion that pisses me off, it's the kind of confusion that intrigues. The kind of confusion that makes the watcher long for more. It makes you work to understand how and why everything is happening. It gives you the main base somewhat linearly, however, when piecing the details together, it fits beautifully. Who would've guessed that a suicide victim's message would've caused all this? This review is spoiler-free, so I won't speak about the ending phase. But, oh my god, it is moving.- - - - Style - - - -A key part of Lain is its style. Between its artistic portrayal of its themes scattered among the background or its lighting changes to represent important areas that Lain interacts in, the style is prevalent and necessary to understand the overall message and story. Between layers, which are episodes, the premise of blending the border of the Wired and the real world shown with how the powerlines stay parallel to powerlines intertwining and balling up to a point where they break are incredibly creative details. The change of Lain's room from going to relatively empty to chaotic cyber landscape, just showing how far Lain is connected to the Wired. The text used in the opening sequences and title card makes you feel like you're in the Wired. The bright white used in contrast with the mix of red and black in nearly every day scene adds to that surrealistic feeling.- - - - Environments - - - -Don't even get me started on the environments. Cyberia feels lively and always moving. As if at any moment something important, good or bad, will happen. The same goes for the Iwakura home. Even if it may be silent, it's almost as if you don't want to be. Like something unsettling could be right around the corner, adding to the mystery ambience. The loud drone of the powerline transformers as Lain walks to the train paired with the train's atmosphere join in a unsettling, mysterious vibe. The best example of a great environment is the Wired. The Wired is supposed to be a simple communication and information medium but it has so much more than what the surface entails. I can't go into it, just watch it an find out.It has so much more to it that I can't describe here, not without it spoiling the show. I want this to be a persuasive review, so I would like it the reader of this review to watch Lain. It will take you through so many ideas that you may have never explored before.+ added bonus point for boa - duvet. actively attempted to skip it, but it was so good that I literally couldn't.Personal Rating: Let's All Love Lain / 10"
Chou Robot Seimeitai Transformers Micron Densetsu,"I'm proud to be the first negative review for this show. Fam... It's bad. The 6.82 that the show currently has is being very generous. This is about as average as an anime can be. I have to assume that the people who rated it anything higher than a 5 just have nostalgia for it OR they really love Transformers and haven't seen enough anime to know how to spot a bad one.First thing to know is that this show had an unusual production where it was written, produced, and animated in Japan, but it was released with English voices first. If you watch the...English dub, you're literally watching the inferior version. A lot of animation errors were corrected for its Japanese dub release. For some reason, the English version renamed all of the characters. Some of the names feel totally incorrect for the character while others make more sense. For example, if you find yourself wondering why Red Alert doesn't seem like the Transformer named Red Alert that you're familiar with, that's because he's actually called ""Ratchet"" in the Japanese version of the show. But I personally don't think either name fits this character. So who is he supposed to be? I have no idea. It's a mess. I don't know what they were thinking. If you aren't familiar with ANY Transformers, you probably won't be bothered by this, but it WILL probably confuse you later when you try to engage with any other Transformers media.I feel bad for the minicons in this show. They're treated like literal robots without personality. None of them speak and they're just used as weapons and accessories by both sides. They're one of the weakest parts of the show, which is extremely unfortunate because they're supposed to be the central focus of the story. I can appreciate what they were going for in THEORY, but the execution is just uninteresting and passionless, and it makes it feel kind of perplexing as a decision overall. It really feels like it must've been a ""We don't have enough time, so we just have to go with whatever we come up with first and make it work"" kind of situation. (Apparently production was being rushed by the network, so that feeling doesn't seem to be unfounded.) People complain about the Transformers cartoons feeling like toy commercials (because they are), but this is definitely one of the most blatant examples. This show exists as an excuse to flash robots on the screen to make you buy them. Quality be damned.The human characters are what I expect from this era of low-effort anime for children - especially from the shows that were trying to make you buy something. Which is to say, they aren't interesting. There's the girl, the boy, and the other boy. They occupy more screentime than they deserve because they effectively do nothing. Their relationship with the Transformers is paper-thin. At best, they're in the way. At worst, they're annoying. I feel a little mean, but there's nothing substantial enough about these characters to make them worth defending.Most of the episodes take place in a vague field or canyon where the two sides fight in boring, poorly animated battle sequences. Once you've seen one fight, you've seen them all. They don't get more interesting. I found myself zoning out through 70% of most episodes.I've seen fans say that the designs of the Transformers is what they like most about Armada. As toys, they look too blocky and cluttered. In animation, they look stiff as hell. I don't know what possessed them to make designs that would be that difficult to animate.You know it's dire when even the out-of-context compilations on YouTube can't make this show seem funny or interesting. It's just boring, and that's one of the worst things a show can be. If you're easily hypnotized by Optimus Prime, I guess this show is for you."
Blue Lock vs. U-20 Japan,"Season 2 of Blue Lock is one of the worst adaptions you can get for your favorite manga. While Season 1 already was rough with its very bad looking CGI and not-so-great animation, it was still solid enough with some highlights sprinkled in between. Season 2 meanwhile is a whole powerpoint presentation (not even exaggerated, there's a powerpoint transition at one point) most of the time with way too much VFX to make still-frames look better. (Which does not work)Most feet interactions are now completely CGI, which doesn't look great, but somehow still better than the rest.. though it still reminds me of Galactik Football...from 2006.So far there only has been like two ""highlights"" where the animators really tried to save this shitshow, but overall, nothing can be saved anymore.The U-20 Arc could've been one of the best Arcs this year... if it would be Production I.G instead of 8bit.As it is now, this Season is just a big disappointment and a disgrace to the Manga author and its fans.The only good thing about it is the source material, because that is still insanely good."
Yozakura-san Chi no Daisakusen,"In a world filled with sadness and loss, how we do cope? At its core, Mission: Yozakura Family (MYF) is about answering this in a simplistic way that all ages can understand. It may not be a ground-breaking answer, but sometimes simplicity makes for the most effective reminders. Happiness is found through accepting absurdity and opening your heart to others.I haven't consistently updated my MAL in years, but I've never anticipated an anime more prior to its release than this series right here. So, I'd like to give my review from the perspective of a long-time source material reader.Many protagonists of Weekly Shonen Jump manga...(and their anime adaptations) share overlapping traits. Taiyo Asano is no exception, but his introduction is effective. The anime opens with a flashback and a monologue that instantly explains what he's about. He's an anxious, traumatized teenager who's scared of losing people he loves. The theme of loss can be interpreted in all sorts of ways with many people. It's not just Taiyo either. The series reveals early on that the titular Yozakura family have also experienced loss. Most notably, in my opinion, is Kyoichiro Yozakura.Kyoichiro is introduced as an off-putting, antagonistic force.  He's instantly juxtaposed with Taiyo. In the first episode, while Taiyo is the ""good-guy"" and Kyoichiro is the ""bad-guy,"" Taiyo realizes that both of them are victims of loss who have developed unhealthy coping mechanisms and altered personalities. With Taiyo, it's his extreme social anxiety. With Kyoichiro, it's his extreme obsession with his sister (while his obsession with Mutsumi Yozakura becomes an ongoing gag, the character writing is taken seriously enough to not let him be portrayed as an incestuous predator). Taiyo's journey begins when his desire to protect who he loves overpowers his fear of loss. As a result, he influences and inspires the entire family to overcome their own loss.Mission: Yozakura Family is less about romantic love and more about familiar love and a general appreciation of mundane moments of joy that we often take for granted until they can no longer be replicated. There's a large focus on humorous interactions amongst each other and the illogical circumstance about this series' world of spies. The spy element of the series is used as a joke more than anything. Very little about the way the Yozakura and other spies work make sense. Whether or not this is funny will vary from person to person, but it doesn't harm the series' writing as the absurdity and chaos of life (both good and bad) are things we have to accept. Taiyo and Mutsumi's relationship is cute to watch, but it lacks any real drama or significant development simply because it's not the driving force of the story.The story is a slow-building mystery of discovering what caused the hardships of Taiyo and the Yozakura family and then fighting to prevent further loss from occurring. This element of MYF is really fun to watch, but it's also where the anime adaptation fumbles the most. The production planning for the anime was reportedly great, and anyone with knowledgeable of the recent works of animation studio SILVER LINK could tell you that the quality of the anime's 27 episode run was surprisingly well. However, doing surprisingly well when expectations were disastrous doesn't exactly cut it for many anime fans seeking high-quality art and animation. Aside from the notably talented voice cast and, MYF's quality is quite average which can be a turn-off for many seasoned anime fans.Another struggle the anime adaptation faced was pacing. The staff clearly wanted to adapt an ambitiously large amount of content in a single two-cour season. There are ways to adapt large amounts of content within a limited episode count that can come across as lazy. With MYF, that clearly wasn't the case. They managed to get an extra episode more than the standard 26 and they added some additional content that fixed some of the biggest criticisms of the manga. However, they had to remove fan favorite scenes in order to reach the end point. Many of these involve episodic plots and characters who only received small cameos and references in the anime that can easily be repurposed for the confirmed second season. However, the Skeleton Island arc particularly suffered from cut lines and shortened backstories that won't be coming back. While the decision to cover as much content as they did to tell a satisfying story in a single season is highly respectable, it wasn't without its drawbacks.Overall, this anime can be a really fun time for anyone who enjoys light-hearted excitement or anyone struggling with grief and loneliness. Even the power-ups introduced in the second half of the season reflect each character's individual coping mechanisms in really creative ways. However, I'd recommend it alongside the manga rather than as a substitute. Both versions have their pros and cons, but together they make up what is my personal favorite fictional story of all time. The second season is in production as of the writing of this review, and let me assure you that things will keep getting better from here."
Kusuriya no Hitorigoto,"This anime is so incredible in all aspects, that i had to write a review about it. Plese, if you are thinking if you should watch it or not, give it a chance, I'm certain you will not regret it.Let me say something, I'm surely not a fan of historical anime, and thought i wouldn't like this show when I first encountered it. How of a fool I was. The plot is a 10/10, the characters too, the subtle romance is so cute i can't even describe it.Maomao is such a good character, and her love for what she does is amazing and contagius....The mistery of this show is very good too, making you think about everything that is happening. The lore of each character is equally interesting and touching."
Mirai Nikki (TV),"I struggle to call this a ""good"" show but it's definitely entertaining.Like seven different girls have their tits out, nipples included, two of those are either during or shortly after their rape-involved backstories, there is a lot of shitty CGI, the MC is a crybaby, it has flaws for sure but it's a fun show and that's all that I can ask for, given some of the shit I've seen this year aloneUnlike a certain show I've seen that also has 12 holders of the titular object, this DOES have fun battles and stuff throughout, which I am very happy with. Given that there are...12 diary holders and 26 episodes, the pacing is pretty snappy and it's always moving, which does have its drawbacks.Let's talk about the diary holders.The First (aka our MC) is, as I described above, a bitch. A whiny crybaby. I don't remember him being this insufferable in the manga but maybe it's like Zenitsu (who I actually like but that's neither here nor there) where having to HEAR him makes him worse. He does EVENTUALLY grow some balls and we even get a good arc where he's working in harmony with Yuno as a pair and pulling off a pretty wicked plan but even that kind of falls to the wayside and he kind of regresses.The Second, let's be honest, it's probably why you're here. I wouldn't say she's my FAVORITE yandere but she has earned the title of Yandere Queen for a reason. Yuno is batshit insane and carries the anime whenever it's dragging by sheer yandere power. My problem is less with her and more with the First. Bro, just kiss the girl. ""waaaah! waaaah! I have a hot psycho killer girlfriend!"" Second-world problems, my man, hit the weights, take a shower, get a fucking clue. Like, I know that's considered a problem in-story too but even so, I still have to watch this story with my own eyes, you can't just make him insufferable and go ""erm, it's part of the story!"" like yeah, it is, but you know?Third, lmao, moving on (for what it's worth, he did his part well)I thought the Fourth was okay. I enjoyed his part in the story, even if his end result was a little underwhelming.I thought the Fifth was unlikeable. And, yeah, I guess that's probably the point but it would have been nice to smack the piss out of that wimpy coward. I guess good job?FUCK the Sixth. I guess, like with the Fifth, I'm not supposed to like her, but I would've at least stomped on her handball or something for what she tried to do with Yuno. I know this was the rape backstory that WAS in the manga but tbh, I kinda feel like this one was less necessary? I get why it's here, I guess, but considering what her life is like outside of the sexual abuse, I don't think she'd be a very pleasant person anyway.Speaking of rape, the Seventh! I actually really like the Seventh. Other than Second and Ninth, they're probably my favorite diary holder. They provide a nice balance to the main protagonists and I think their arc was one of the highlights.I genuinely have no feelings on the Eighth. She's just kinda there. I guess she's ""the good diary holder"" but I didn't feel much of a connection there.The Ninth is probably the second fan favorite and for good reason. We get lots of time to bond with her, she's got a decent little subplot, nice fights with Yuki, I'm glad it wasn't JUST Yuki and Yuno (although I do have a gripe to discuss later).I honestly forget the Tenth even exists a lot of the time. Maybe it's because they end up befriending Yuki after but like he's just some weird dog boy.Tbh, I kinda wish the Eleventh was in it more? It's not that I like him so much, I've just GOTTA have more but... there's no real arching antagonist, it's just the author pointing Yuno at the nearest target and firing. I feel like the Eleventh would make a lot of sense as the main antagonist but he's just a diary holder at this point.The Twelfth isn't in it much but he's funny. I kinda wish he was in it more because he doesn't get much screentime and is the subplot to someone else's arc.Other than that, I really liked Akise. I kinda forgot he even existed before watching the anime so it was a nice surprise to see him again.Although speaking of Akise... I don't really get why the Survival Game even exists? Deus Ex Machina HAS an assistant, why didn't he just go ""fuck you, Murmur, you're God now""? I guess she's shown time and time again to be biased and not qualified but you're telling me a five year old child is?I guess maybe they convinced him it'd be funnier to do a Survival Game?But also, how exactly does this work?Deus Ex Machina is dying and it doesn't seem like he was attacked, it just seems like natural causes.So if someone were to win this Survival Game, are they immortal? Are they eventually going to have to pick a successor? Gods in this series seem as susceptible to physical attacks as a normal human being but they also don't seem to age? How exactly did Deus start dying?Speaking of Deus, I wanna talk about Murmur for a second. I thought the post-ED epilogue skits were a nice touch, I found them chuckle-worthy and while you could have easily done a preview, I think it made me connect a lot more with Murmur than in the manga.I mentioned rape earlier and I feel like this leans into the trashier aspect of the show. Basically every attractive female has their tits out at one point or another in the show. Second, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, both Hinata and Mao, even Yuki's crush pre-Yuno? Like, I'm not deducting points for it or anything but damn.Also, it's very Yuki/Yuno-centric? Which, yeah, absolute masterclass of a doctorate thesis there, SSP, ""the main character is the focus of the show"" but idk, I think it would've been cool to see some non-First/Second diary holders squaring off. Imagine Fourth v. Ninth v. Twelfth or Fifth v. Eighth.So how does this death game end?I actually really like it, although if you watch all the way to the end past the last ED, it starts poking at it to undo it, which I am not happy with.I won't spoil how it ends but it's a nice, bittersweet end that I think fits the story.Idk, it's kind of a junk food series. I wouldn't say it's an Objectively Good, scholarly masterpiece. It's kind of schlocky and more of a junk food show that you can blow through in a week or two. If you wanna watch a yandere go sicko mode on a bunch of fools, I would recommend. I don't think it's for everyone but it certainly has an audience, it's very popular for a reason."
Seishun Buta Yarou wa Yumemiru Shoujo no Yume wo Minai,"Well, this is my first review of an anime, please don’t be harsh😅.To be fair, I enjoyed original series a lot, but I didn’t expect the movie to be THAT amazing.I am not a big anime geek or something, so it’s hard for me to judge drawing. I enjoy watching anime once in a while. And a lot of them are romance anime, so I was prepared for somewhat loner MC, but it was a pleasant surprise for MC to be that interesting.I really loved this movie, the plot was actually amazing. It made me, a grown man, shad a tear, not...even one, probably:). I really loved it, probably because of a lot of factors, but the music made the experience SO much better, more beautiful even.After all, this was a wonderful series. I watched it all in a single evening.Thank you for reading."
"""Oshi no Ko"" 2nd Season","I liked this anime for the first season, although I didn't really like it, but I think this anime is good enough to watch.Like the opening song in the first season, this anime seemed to be in turmoil and immediately rose to first place in the MAL rankings, for those of you who don't know this, but unfortunately this popularity only lasted temporarily.I was quite happy when this anime announced a second season, but from the thumbnail I felt something was strange.And it turns out my hunch was right, this anime is not what I expected.Why do I feel disappointed? Maybe I can explain some.First,...this anime is about Idols, but for some reason in the second season, the storyline 100% changed to a different direction. What is this? I wonder! Why did this anime turn into an anime that tells about Theater? Aren't these the characters that are telling about Idol?Maybe some of you will say that this anime is not really an Idol, or that Idol is just a mother while her child is not, or that this anime tells about cyberspace competition, and other almost similar answers.Yes, I understand that, it's okay for the story to change into a drama actor, but there should be a process first, I saw that at the beginning of the first episode this anime was already on the drama actor path.Second, for the opening and ending songs, it doesn't seem to describe this anime, As we know, in the first season, this anime had good opening and ending songs, but unfortunately in my opinion, the second season was not as good as the first season.Third, from their voice actors, is it because I didn't rewatch the second season, hearing the characters in this anime speak feels different from usual.Or is it because the storyline has deviated from Idol to drama players that makes me think so? Whatever it is, I think the voice actors don't sound consistent from the previous series.Lastly, in the first season, the older brother was determined to find his mother's killer, but with the opening of the second season, he became a drama player, I think that would still be a long way off!I'm not a manga or LN reader, so I only know the development through the anime, so when this anime changed from Idol to drama actors, I found it very unpleasant to watch."
Jujutsu Kaisen 2nd Season,"The only reason to watch Jujutsu Kaisen season 1 is to get to season 2 eventually. The second season completely blows the first one out of the water. Season 1 felt like a very average shounen. Season 2 was jampacked with action, fighting and story. While season 1 felt like it was progressing at a snail's pace, season 2 went nuts. The first arc was a prequel with a great story, action and villain. The second arc goes back to the current timeline and is very bloody and action packed. Every episode had something fun happening. It's just like the saying, ""There are years where...nothing happens and there are days where years happen.""First of all, this is the best animation I have seen yet. PERIOD. That alone makes this deserving of a 10. It's like watching more than a dozen fights with the quality level of Naruto vs Sasuke. A complaint is when the fights are shitting lasers out the wazoo, it's hard to keep track of what is going on. The prettiest fights in this show are the ones where the power is limited and you can see what is going on. If you want your eyes to tear up, watch the Yuji vs Choso episode. It is the best animation I have seen.Sadly, some flaws leak over from the first season. A lot of the side characters are very uninteresting and they remain uninteresting in this season. In fact, the Kyoto students except Todo are all still annoying and irrelevant.The power system is still very convoluted just like in the first season and you don't understand what the hell is happening. Sometimes I do understand it, such as Achilles and the turtle and Choso's blood undergoing osmosis in a hypotonic solution. However, there is no enjoyment gained from understanding that. I still have no fucking clue what the basis is for Gojo's powers, it feels like a bunch of semi-relevant but completely separate powers. Then they start throwing terms like Reverse Cursed Technique without explaining them and it gets even more confusing. All of these complications..... for no benefit to the viewer."
Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken,"talking about the best isekai anime, one thing I will say is it's hard, it's hard to determine whether Konosuba or Tensura, but if I have to talk a bit seriously maybe I will give this throne to Tensura (reincarnated as a slime) because this anime has a very interesting world building and story. a very satisfying story and doesn't get stuck in the mind. the story is light but still serious and delicious, I don't even get bored of watching it over and over again while eating.I give 100 out of 10 for this anime, an anime that I always wait for the new...season. Light Novels never disappoint."
Burn the Witch,"Burn the Witch obviously at this stage some obvious flaws as a result of getting pushed into such a small time frame but despite that I still think it was a fun watch. I feel like Kubo really wanted to go in a younger more colorful direction in contrast with the edgy and angsty style of Bleach and he has done that very well. This being set in the Bleach universe also brings up a lot of questions regarding what dragons are. Since they are basically a version of hollow, what would dragons be? Hollows come from the souls of humans while dragons seem to...breed and hatch from eggs. How does the power system work? Could the Chief beat Goku? I came out of this with more questions than answers. I anticipate the direction that this series is heading and if another part of this gets released I will surely watch more."
Sora yori mo Tooi Basho,"I like very much that this anime doesn't have fanservice and that they don't make the main characters stupids and dumb just because they are women, young women. It is true that sometimes they do dumb things, but like most people their age would do. I just see them as young girls who are experiencing and enjoying life. Anyway, there will be exaggeration and nonsense because it is anime, and that's my reason I overlook some things in this anime, and anime in general.In my view, the ending of “that” episode is exemplary among works in general and one of the best culminations I've watched....It made me like this anime even more.I wouldn't be more detailed about what I like and do not like about this anime because, for me, the simple fact of writing a positive review for a work, which I rarely do, shows my personal admiration.In short, I will remember and recommend this anime."
Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!,"Konosuba or I often call it Konosubung in my local language is my favorite Isekai anime, I give 100 out of 10 for this anime, it's really amazing considering what I get from this anime is also amazing.the story template about the main character being reincarnated into isekai then having the task of defeating the demon king, but one thing that is different from other anime is that the story in this anime is very funny, instead of appearing fierce, the story is actually very silly and makes my stomach laugh.the characters are also very detailed, and strong in character, Kazuma is the MC with...ridiculous skills, Darkness is my favorite, and of course our Goddess of Stupidity Aqua, Megumin with her explosions.the anime that I always wait for the new season, I hope it will be available soon to watch the new season of this anime."
Gakuen Handsome,"If it had raunchiness, and vulgarity, heck, I’d even allow creepy sex jokes – it would live up to it’s potential and be a 10/10. It had a certain character who seemed to be that type, but it just didn't happen. Without those, it's not even funny bad, it's just bad.The episodes are 3 minutes each and they are so painfully PG that 3 minutes of it is just enough for the watcher to see what’s up, exhale through their nose (like you would when you see a funny short video on your For You page on that other app)  and move on to...the next show. Because every other 3 minutes would just be spent in vain, repeating the same re-clothed, reheated dinner type jokes with little to no flavor to them.It is pretty clear what this show was trying to do, it’s primarily a parody of the BL genre, harem, high school setting and everything that happens in those shows yada yada. But the issue with it is that IT DIDN’T GO HARD ENOUGH. AT ALL. When they first look at the cover art, what do potential watchers see? This freaky, purposefully made mess created in freaking MS Paint! That’s what drew me in, and I’d assume most of the other people.It looks completely insane, so why aren't the actual action and story as deranged too? Mind you, it does have some haha hehe wow silliness, funny ED and some predictable shock value elements (can you even call it shock if it’s predictable?) but with what this could've been that's the equivalent of standing in front of a huge buffet with all kinds of delicious and exotic food, and just taking a cracker.TL;DR: They look like freaks but they aren't freaky at all. :("
Gintama,"This is the best anime for the comedy genre, maybe even the best of all anime, I'm serious about itfrom the beginning to the end (finished) in which season I forgot because there are so many episodes, I never get tired of watching it. a very extraordinary comedy in my opinion, adult comedy, classic comedy, parody, politics, and so on. even the story can enter our dimension. my favorite characters are of course the MC, Gintama and also Hijikata and also Zura, all three are clowns in their respective groups haha. I even really hope that a new series of this best anime will be...made again. the voice actor from Gintama (Tomokazu Sugita) is the best in my opinion, with his distinctive style that is very suitable for playing the stupid character haha.I give 100 out of 10 for this extraordinary anime, and will continue to hope for a new series of this anime."
One Piece,"First, I'm sure everyone here must know about One Piece. and understand how amazing this anime is, its long story and who knows when it will end. heheindeed there are some things that I don't like about this anime, such as the bad powerscale, the shape of the characters that appear in this anime is not proportional, the mysteries that have not been solved but OdaSensei instead adds new mysteries that eventually pile up. and some other shortcomings. which some of you may also agree with me. regardless of all that, I give 10 out of 10 for this amazing anime.and hopefully we will live...long enough to be able to watch this anime. hehealmost forgot, my favorite characters are Zoro and Luffy as well as Robin and Hancock."
Hunter x Hunter (2011),"Hunter x Hunter 2011 (HxH) has its flaws, but it is overall the most enjoyable shounen out there. The music is very good and fitting for the scenes in the show. It has strong story arcs and moments, although 2 of the arcs are tedious. The characters are a bit shallow, but their actions and interactions are entertaining. The flaws of the show are a lot of the time buried in its strengths so they are inconsequential. Sometimes, however, you do notice them rear their ugly heads.Most of the popular shounen have one thing that sets them apart from every other one. For example,...for Naruto it was the final villains and their backstories. For HxH, its biggest strength is its flexibility when it comes to morality. A protagonist might have an evil or a good background. A good person can do evil and an evil person can do good. Everything happens within its context and every case is taken separately. One good example is an antagonist trying to develop a protagonist so he can savor killing him brutally when he's stronger.HxH is not interested in moral grandstanding. It's not about Gon talking down to every villain and doing self-righteous monologues. Everyone has their goals and they work towards them. Gon is a very useful plot device in that regard. A kid raised in the countryside whose end goal is to become a Hunter and in the process, learn what motivated his father to become a Hunter. Gon is curious to see and experience everything in his journey. Consequently, he tends to view things with interest rather than being judgemental. If Gon sees a technique for killing, his first reaction would be amazement rather than give a lecture on why killing is bad.Most of the show follows Gon and Kilwa. Gon is the curious, whimsical but dauntless child who wears his heart on his sleeve. In contrast, his friend Kilwa is careful and calculated. Leorio is comedic relief. Kurapika is my least favorite character because he is self-righteous and edgy. However, the show handles him really well especially after the first arc. At some point you don't really see Leorio and Kurapika that much because it doesn't make sense for them to always be together, plot-wise.It is best to view the plot as episodical rather than a continuous journey towards a certain goal. The structure of the show is multiple subplots that usually relate to some bigger overarching plot for a character. For example, an arc might be centered around achieving a certain objective which progresses Gon's end goal of finding his father.The biggest weakness of HxH is two very tedious arcs. The Greed Island arc felt like a filler arc, except for the very end of it where they just randomly throw you a conclusion that progresses the story. I personally view it as the author wanting to do a fantasy anime on a whim. Similarly, the Chimera Ant arc felt like it lasted an eternity. To add insult to injury, the climax had some really long scenes where time is frozen and they just narrate what everyone is thinking. It had a few strong moments, but I wish it wasn't so stretched out."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"So I just finished rewatching FMAB an hour ago and haven't stopped crying since. There is something almost magical about this series. It lights up a fire inside my heart. I adore it for all it is and what it did to me.Being on the older side, you can expect animation that is not as great as the newer ones, but honestly that doesn't apply for this one. I'm very focused on how the anime looks before anything else. FMAB surprised me. I appreciate that the production decided to use CGI very minimally (although the only thing I hated about it was Envy's true form...animations). It gave a traditional vibe, but not the type that would annoy me personally.Story-wise, I liked that the focus wasn't ONLY on the Elric brothers. You get bits of stories, motivations, goals, thoughts etc. from various supporting characters. That, for me, deepened my attachment to this series. The entire plot was very well arranged. Nothing was rushed or too slow. Everything was explained clearly at exactly the moment you needed to know that information. Another plus, the plot twists. Although the end can be easily predicted, the journey in itself until there is getting slightly more complicated every episode. It was fun to see Ed and Al's adventures, hardships that they've gone through, everything they learned, and their trust in each other.As for character development, LET ME TELL YOU. I got towards the end loving characters I used to dislike or even hate (primary example: my baby Greed, I love him). Every participant in the brothers' journey got their truth spelled out, figuring out their objectives, setting new ones, forming relationships, changing their ways, finding out who they really are etc. It's spectacular to watch every character grow.For the last point, something that I personally love seeing in anime: the tint of romance. I liked that they made it as a sub-subplot ahahah. For some of the characters, it was clear as day, but for others, it was so subtle and thoughtful.Overall, FMAB is a masterpiece. Bonus points because the OST is so good. 10/10"
Perfect Blue,"It's not a bad movie, but it is a bit boring, and barely qualifies as horror, far far more of a drama.The commentary/exploration of idols/idolization-obsession/parasocial relationships/performance industries/(s)exploitation, oneself/one's persona/other's perception of you, delusion/reality/fiction, mental health, etc. was decent aside from embracing lookism of beauty=good, ugly=evil. Though some of it did seem a bit surface level.The story itself involved a lot of empty fluff scenes, and overall very little of interest happens other than in proximity to some dancing, SA, and a few scenes of violence.The plot itself is kinda predictable as only 3 or so options are presented for the narrative antagonisms and most end...up being shown as such, and an unreliable narrative means most any of the other possibilities could conceivably be true as well.It was much more cohesive than the similar Paprika, though less visually interesting. I liked this marginally more.(There's also a hilarious plot hole where the character she's acting as within the meta-show starts off as a non-character sister after the murders are already happening, and the writer guy is stuck on who to make the killer while the show airing, then he decides to have her SAd as justification for her becoming the killer... so the only possibility would be that they did a flashback to setup this random sister as a SA survivor which would be hilariously terrible storytelling in a murder mystery to retcon her character, and kinda makes the meta narrative surrounding that tv show fall apart.)"
Dandadan,"Honestly, after the first episode I was going to drop it. Even though nothing happened with those aliens I was really uncomfortable with it. But I decided to do the whole ""three episode"" rule and it's actually a really fun watch! What surprised me the most is how sad episode 7 made me! Actual masterpiece of an episode! I can tell why the manga readers were freaking out about this despite what almost happened (and did happen) in the first episode.With that said, the anime is still obsessed with genitalia and it's really hard to recommend it to people who might be more bothered by...high school children being the target for these ghosts and aliens in those ways."
Kidou Senshi Gundam: Tekketsu no Orphans,"*No spoilers*SummaryMobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans follows a set of orphan child soldiers who form a group called Tekkaden, as they engage in an escorting mission through space. The story is part of the Mobile Suit Gundam (MSG) universe, though watching other MSG shows is not required. There are plenty of giant machine battles, as is expected in the mecha genre. The story starts off interestingly by introducing themes of freedom, liberation, war, mistreatment, and loyalty; however, the story develops more into action, battles, and politics which detracts from these themes. There are excessive characters, and very few of them have time to satisfactorily develop with...all the action. Overall, this series may be of interest to you if you enjoy the mecha genre, sci-fi, and action, and you don’t mind subpar character development. If you are interested in a similar genre with more meaningful characters, dialogue, and thoroughly explored themes, then I recommend Eighty-Six instead.Story: 5/10The story starts, captivatingly, with an emphasis on the mistreatment of the orphan characters as child soldiers. It begins to explore themes such as mistreatment, freedom, and loyalty, although most of these ideas fall short partway through the story. The plot incorporates political tomfoolery as the members of the Tekkaden group embark on an escorting mission. The pacing is satisfactory, although the plot accelerates partway through. This amplifies the action at the expense of character development. By the end, the story is complete, but the meaningfulness explored at the beginning is overshadowed by the action of flashing machines, space travel, and weird political figures with fancy beards. Whereas similar shows tackle political themes in a meaningful way, Iron-Blooded Orphans tosses in unnecessary political rules for plot convenience (or inconvenience, as is the case near the end). The story overall is average, and the biggest flaw is that the plot focuses too much on action and thrills and not enough on the characters. If you are looking for a generally straightforward story with an emphasis on action and moderate suspense, then this will likely suffice; however, the change partway through does detract from the overall meaning.Characters: 4/10There is a plethora of characters in the show with insufficient time for them to develop because of all the action. Some barely have backstories, some are used merely as plot devices, and even some of the interesting characters are practically written out of the story altogether once their bland character arc is completed. This is quite problematic for any story, and it is especially so for Iron-Blooded Orphans because the story itself could have been compelling: The themes lend to character development, yet the story focuses on fights and uncanny political subterfuge instead of the characters’ decisions, wants, needs, emotions, etc.  Ultimately, these characters end up generic and one-dimensional, despite beginning with plenty of potential.Art: 6/10The art is a highlight for this show, especially for fans of action, since the majority is a bunch of giant machines blasting at each other. Some character designs are quite extravagant, especially with the fancy hair styles. These designs help to differentiate between the characters.Sound: 5/10The music is generally dull and unforgettable, but it is adequate.Enjoyment: 4/10I have never been a huge fan of the mecha genre because it often focused on action and battles over substance. I had read the reviews of Iron-Blooded Orphans and thought that this one might be different. It does start off nicely and seems to tackle meaningful themes, but I did not enjoy the second section because it shifted to action rather than developing the characters.Total score: 4.8/10 (low-average)"
Vinland Saga Season 2,"Vinland saga season 2 is a strong disappointment comparing it to the first season. There's hardly any action or suspense, the protagonist takes half of the season to come to terms with what has transpired and essentially wants to become jesus. The pace is sloggish, they deliberately make shots too long conveying no new information with the unnecessary extra seconds. The ideology of nonviolence that the protagonist goes for doesnt make any sense in the timeframe and setting, nobody during viking times would've been shocked by violence that was part of the culture that the warriors lived. I couldn't really care for many of the...characters in the series even when their deaths were dramatized to the extreme. Furthermore, the spesific circumstances of the love triangle were also appalling.Without s1 I wouldn't  have wasted my time for this. But also without s1 the expectations would have been different. I don't think you should change the genre of your anime between seasons. A classic tale of vengage is always more entertaining than a wannabe jesus with poor pseudo philosophical blabbering behind it."
Dungeon Meshi,"Dungeon Meshi is a big plate that has full meal for you!! Whether you like it or not you will watch the entire series.WARNING for vegans & vegetarians planning to start the series, well some scenes you will hate it and some scenes you won't mind it but over all I guess it could be triggering at times to watch this show. (I'm not vegetarian btw) But this anime is a gore anime. Like there will be bones and blood.Anyways let's start the review shall we?Art, character design and world building: 10/10This anime has the best art I've seen so far. Wish Earthsea had an...adaptation and it looked like this. Character design and world building and everything feels so vivid, very cozy and extremely up-to-date like so 2024. Everything looks like it was drawn out of deviantart and reminds me of how art used to be before the AI. Characters and movement and the expressions seem all very organic, real and funny.Plot: 8/10Food is the plot. I mean it has that sense of humor you could see in manga like Dorohedoro or Dai Dark where characters are carefree and focused on things but not 100% locked into their goals so many other things happen while they are on their way to their main goal. It's like every episode there is a main plot and gears are spinning but they are totally on the background and usually they have fun and a lot of things happen. I think compared to anime like Naruto where main plot episodes are really serious and progress is really slow then they add up fillers which are completely irrelevant, this is a better way to process plots. Like lots of fun and things happen slowly one by one.Overall rating: 9/10:I'm not a business man but I can be busy but I finished this anime in one sit. Like entire 24 episodes I binge watched! But my rating is 9/10 because I know that this anime may not be everyone's cup of tea."
Kotoura-san: Haruka no Heya,"This special is just pointless. The premise: the main character of the main series, Kotoura, briefly interviews the 5 main characters of the show, effectively providing a basic character synopsis for each. No matter which order you watch this special with the main show, it doesn't make sense: if you watch this before the show, it spoils the character dynamics and how they develop, and this provides nothing new for after you're finished watching.For positives: some of the jokes are somewhat funny, I guess? Oh! It's less than 10 minutes long, so it at least won't waste a ton of your time!Yeah, don't waste...your time with this one."
Murai no Koi,"This anime is a really great hidden gem. I think it's definitely worth a watch for its unique characters, humor, and surprisingly deep moments.Pros:1) The biggest and best thing about this anime are the supporting characters. They break the stereotypical archetype of the Japanese beta male and have characters that aren't the biggest losers you've ever seen who have never even spoken to a female and get bullied by everyone including the mailman. These characters are... normal. They aren't the class losers, they've dated girls, aren't afraid to be tough or even physical, and talk like normal kids their age (they don't struggle to...form the most basic sentence like most male characters in anime that are basically the lowest form of beta males who need a 30 minute internal monolog before they can even reply to the simplest question from a female). They flirt with and actively pursue girl their age and seem like they're just well adjusted. My favorite trait is how fiercely loyal they are to the MC and stand up for him every chance they get. The dynamic between this trio, their dialog, the way that they are all different but still all manage to be on the save wavelength, and just how cool they all are is what really makes this show for me.2) The humor doesn't always hit. Sometimes things get lost in translation or Japanese humor just doesn't work with the western palate. But the majority of the time most of the jokes are very solid. I had a few laugh out loud moments. The humor tends to very typical Japanese humor (obviously) with things and facial expressions being dramatically exaggerated but it's different enough to stand out.3) The surprising depth that is later revealed about the MC and his relationship with the love interest. While most of the time the anime isn't super serious or dramatic, the backstory of the MC meeting the love interest, and the backstory of the love interest's family dynamic was very touching.4) The overall vibe and feel. This anime stands out because how just how different everything is; specifically the character and their attitudes. They're a friend group i would actually want to be a part of. They want all the characters eventually cross paths and interact with each other is always well don't. A bonus is there are no little girls being sexualized or no one that looks like a 7 year old (that's actually a 3000 year old demon who looks, sounds, and acts like a 7 year old) actively trying to be in a relationship with the MC. In a  culture with lolis, where being a loser and a beta male, not having any experience with girls is the norm, its refreshing to see an anime like this with characters like this.Cons:1) The animation and art style won't be what most people expect. Now, I've never been someone that cares about the animation quality. i don't value style over substance. I won't think an anime is the Bee's knees just because it was animate but some acclaimed studio while having the plot of a toaster. But even I can say the animation leaves a lot to be desired. I don't know how to describe it other that saying a lot of stuff just isn't... animated. They find other ways to show that events happened like still images or caricatures instead of the normal animations. I take it this was don't for budget reasons? I wish I could say it doesn't distract or take away from the anime but there are times where it does. It isn't a complete deal breaker though, as this isn't a battle anime or anything like that were it needs an A++ in animation quality.2) The sudden introduction of a rival competing for the MC's love interest around episode 8 really threw me off. This character wasn't even mentioned before and they went on to be such a major part of the show. The MC plays a back seat role and isn't even seen as this new character steals the screen for a good 3-4 episodes. It felt so out of place. This wasn't the MC's anime any more, it was this new characters. Also the way the love interest was so smitten with the new character really felt out of place for the way her character was written. It made the MC look like a cuck at some parts or that he was competing for a woman that was already in love with someone else. It made you wonder if the love interest was even worth having if she could so easily be captivated by someone else even after knowing the MC loved her.3) Poor pacing and introduction of random one-off characters are also a minor annoyance with this anime. There are big events that are built up that either get cancelled, never occurred, quickly glossed over, or turn out to be a minor event. I think this is a pacing issue more than anything. Also, in episode 7 (I think) so many random new characters are introduced (they are presented to be important but we never hear from them again) and these character have similar design to other characters in the main cast that it really made it hard to even tell who's who. It didn't help that for this episode many of the main cast were wearing disguised or dressed up (even dressed as the opposite sex). It didn't help things that certain characters are non-binary or androgenous. I was so lost that entire episode.Mixed:The ending was a good ending but it felt a bit lack luster. Things you normally expect to see at the end of a romance anime were not shown. While things did wrap up nicely, we were TOLD what happened instead of actually see it play out which as really unsatisfying.Overall I think its a great anime that was much different from anything this season and worth the watch for the characters alone."
Tengoku Daimakyou,"Very intricate plot, great stories of struggle, tragedy, and triumph in a collapsed world. It is extremely, and I mean extremely, refreshing to see an anime that leaves critical elements of the story for you to connect the dots, I.e. it doesn’t have the cliché ‘aha!’ narrative that spells things out for you. It could have been a tad more dark giving us more of that ‘why did he have to die!’ moments. Although I don’t know how that would impact the fantastic humour. Nevertheless, I’m not saying it is not dark, it actually had me biting my nails and with a grieving heart enough...times.Given the above, it is a solid 9, eager to give it a 9.5, but without making me break a tear from tragedy, I can’t give it the 10/10.In short, if you’re fed up with the la la land happily ever after anime era we live in now, this is a gem"
Giji Harem,"Giji Harem is honestly such a refreshing romcom. It doesn’t just throw around the usual tropes; it plays with them in a really clever way. Rin, the main girl, is the soul of the show. Her whole deal of pretending to be different ""harem"" characters to entertain Eiji is both hilarious and heartfelt. You can see how much she enjoys it, but also how much she genuinely cares about him. And Eiji, while being the classic clueless guy, starts to notice the real Rin behind all her performances. Their dynamic is what keeps you hooked— both the comedy and the underlying sweetness.The voice acting really...stands out here. Rin’s VA, Saori Hayami, nails every one of her fake personas, making each ""role"" feel distinct while keeping Rin’s core personality intact. It adds so much charm to her antics. And the animation captures every comedic beat and emotional moment perfectly, it’s vibrant but never over-the-top. Even the little things, like Eiji’s reactions or Rin breaking character, feel so genuine.What I love most is how it balances being light and fun with these deeper, more intimate moments between the two. It’s not just about laughs; you can feel the connection growing with every episode. It’s one of those shows where you can’t help but smile the whole time. Definitely a solid 10/10 for me."
Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu,"this is what i call a master piece there was no part that felt boring the plot is well done, no characters felt annoying and mc has good and concise development throughout, i don't have any complaints about the story i would be interested in seeing where the parasites come from and have an individual arc but i think 24 episodes is good enough it didn't felt dragged at all, and the story there were parts where i felt it was predictable like certain deaths in anime but it didn't really ruin the anime in any way when the death of the character happend it...felt like a fitting death, and the world is also interesting of parasites there was good world development too like how the government started reacting to the parasites i don't want to spoil anything but i think everyone should give this the 3 episode rule and im sure you'll love it go into this blind to get best experiencethis is what i call an anime that will stay in my mind for lifetime"
MF Ghost 2nd Season,A great watch for any motorsport or car enthusiast. The second season of the sequel to Initial D. I think the second season has improved in quality even from the first. The character and car animation is pleasant and the racing displays tons of excitement to watch. The story has solid pacing and doesn't feel rushed. The characters also have decent depth for being a show focused on racing (even if some of them are scumbags...). The OP and soundtrack are fantastic in this anime as well. This is a must watch if you are into racing and cars.Story - 8.5/10Animation - 9/10Enjoyment - 9.5/10Characters...- 8/10Pacing - 8.5/10Soundtrack - 9/10Honest review from an honest anime enjoyer. Thanks!
Murai no Koi,"I know why you are here. You probably heard some imbecile call this anime atrocious, or maybe the art style gave you the impression that this is a “so bad it’s good” hidden gem. A good candidate for that drunken watch on a Friday night, right? It couldn’t be further from the truth.The plot is nothing unusual for a romcom: high school boy falls in love with his teacher but she has a dark secret (is addicted to the 2D world), so he tries to emulate her favourite character. As with any comedy, the quality relies on whether the author is able to deliver fresh...scenarios and jokes before the audience is able to predict the outcome in advance. As this is the case here, highlighted by a bright cast, this paragraph could end right here with a succinct positive recommendation.But this is not the slightly above average romcom of the season. This is one of the best litmus tests for appreciation of artistry in the anime medium. Bear with me.---In any artistic medium, it’s easy to correlate a display of technical competence with overall quality. Bernini is rightfully known as a genius for transforming blocks of marble into seraphic representations of myths and legends. If you take “Apollo and Daphne” and compare it to that amorphous clay piece your nephew gave you after school, it’s easy to conclude the former is a superior form of art in technical terms (even though you may cherish your nephew’s present more than a free pass to the Galleria Borghese).Nonetheless, such correlation is not perfect. Art has a strong subjective component. If that was not the case, one of those thousands of “perfectly drawn portraits” we see on social media would be more valued than Picasso’s whole career, since they are a 1:1 copy of a real-life image, while Guernica looks like the aftermath of an ugly accident between Lego trains. Still, one can easily spend dozens of minutes staring at Guernica, appreciating every small detail in awe. The carnage represented by that one painting is arguably more effective in representing the horror of war than a carbon copy painting of a scene from a gore film. While browsing Instagram, you may find m@ndy009’s charcoal drawing of a horse impressive, but it lacks expressiveness if it's only a display of technical prowess. It’s nothing a good photograph couldn’t capture as well. Why is Guernica’s deformed horse more noteworthy? If you take a look at Picasso’s early works, you can see he had the capacity to paint however he wanted. So why choose simple geometric forms? There is a special component that separates good art from sublime art: artistry, or the creative vision to express oneself.My former examples were restricted to sculpture and painting, but we can make parallels to any other medium. Nowadays videogames can look as “realistic” as live action films, yet it’s hard to find any new decent game to play. The film industry is capable of using top notch special effects to make magic seem real; the only problem is how boring they make those magical worlds. The best music is not necessarily the most difficult to reproduce. The best book does not necessarily contain the widest vocabulary. In animation, a crisp art style with fluid movements may be good to look at, but I’d rather rewatch Texhnolyze than to follow the new seasons of a “sakuga porn”.Any piece of art is a collection of components assembled together to reach the finished product. Animation, script writing and soundtrack all can individually stand out or singlehandedly ruin an anime. You don’t need each and every one of them to be state-of-the-art displays of technical prowess to make an anime good. In fact, working within constrains or even choosing an alternative “subpar” style to better express their vision will arrive at a more meaningful result. Each part must serve the overall work. They can be compared to organs in a body. While your pancreas is not aesthetically pleasing to look at, it still serves a pivotal function. When you admire the beauty of Monica Bellucci, keep in mind her ugly pancreas is working just fine.---Now, let’s make sense of all my rambling.Murai no Koi, to put it gently, has a minimalistic animation and art style. My middle school stop motion flicks had more frames than some scenes from this anime. However, this is not a problem at all. The direction was able to use those sudden movements and “camera angles” to maximize the comic delivery. Absurd inner monologues were perfectly matched by even more absurd facial and body expressions. Because actions sequences were in jest, not having that fluid movement was no detriment at all. The plot follows an appropriately erratic pace, which is only achievable if the production team is competent and not burdened by three sleepless nights in a row. You can see they were having as much fun as the spectator.Overall, it’s a breath of fresh air. Here you have an anime that escapes from the vicious convergence in art style and animation standards most series conform to (or fail trying to). The director understood the heart of the (already good) original manga. He then worked within his budget to deliver its full potential. Jokes and references land; all characters have their time to shine; the plot is paced properly. Everything works as a highly functioning organism."
Murai no Koi,"Murai in Love — The manga-turned-anime PowerPoint animation strikes again...it's just pure laziness, I'm telling ya...or this is just a modern animation technique that is perfected depending on the source material?In the modern age of the AniManga industry, where the age-old argument of ""quantity vs. quality"" is just as important as the years pass by, you can't doubt me in the face that while the industry is facing more shortages in manpower than ever, studios are ""trying"" to get creative in utilizing just about every and all animation techniques, not just to cut corners with the ever-decreasing budget but also to deliver within the insanity...of deadlines for all anime projects. This has been the case for the once-renowned studio of J.C.Staff, helming the extreme insanity that is almost unheard of: nearing the total double-digit count of shows (including Summer's leftover that is 2.5-jigen no Ririsa a.k.a 2.5 Dimensional Seduction). That is just tipping the scales of Japan's notorious infamous Black Company-esque workplace, but I digress, because all of the studio's shows have their own flare that you could still watch them for what they are.This then, segways to mangaka Junta Shima's lone work of Murai no Koi a.k.a Murai in Love, a bare-bones rom-com between an adult and a student, and the similarity that helms that relationship is a fictional character from a game. On hindsight, this completed manga series enclosing 71 chapters within 7 volumes that once had an 8-episode live-action TV drama in Spring 2022 before the anime came around, I'm guessing the peeps in Japan having the chance to see the drama is a novelty in and of itself to experience the manga in live-action format (as opposed to something like anime). And 2.5 years later, the anime finally comes around...to be given J.C.Staff's once-heavily panned and now ""solidified"" motion-comic treatment that Gokushufudou a.k.a The Way of the Househusband got back in Spring 2021. Is this for the worse, or better, this time around? You be the judge.If you'd ask me what I think about age-gap romances, there is a ""yes and no"" depending on the circumstances in which the setting was set up to begin with. And in Murai no Koi's case, that would be the series's male MC named Murai: the cool-looking blonde-haired student who excels within his grade in school, who has the usual clique of high school friends (like you would any growing young adult), and the romantic love interest...of a teacher? As it turns out, his homeroom teacher of Ayano Tanaka is quite the teacher that more than the usual colleagues of the fellows around her, she is seemingly unmarried for her ""young"" and youthful-looking age. The problem with her (or as the students refer to her as ""Tetsuko"" because of her ""steel heart"") is twofold: she is only interested in the pseudonym character that comes from the Otome game that she plays: Hitotose, and the realization that like 2.5D Seduction, the difference between the titular fictional character and Murai himself is battling thealmost exact appearances in different 2D or 3D plains, that Tetsuko refuses to acknowledge that Murai is the splitting image of her favourite mobage character enough to consider him as a candidate for love, that confoundedly has been established since their childhood days (no spoilers on that).If the main couple just can't establish their connection, there's always the friends around them that would help make that E.T. establishment effort work. Murai's friends of Kiriyama and Hirai, as the chitter-chattering birds they are, are true ""bros before hoes"" guys who just want to see their good friend be acknowledged by Tanaka, while measuring up against the others who could jeopardize their relationship. The fellow classmates, ranging from the bros to the Nishifuji sisters of Yuka and Hitomi, who are related to both Tanaka and Murai are real craftswomen in the drawing department; they're like fans in the form of annoying flies around both of them in trying to strike a chord together. The real contenders are Murai's childhood friend of Yayoi Fukunaga and Tanaka's coworker of the ""teacher from hell,"" that is Yamakado-sensei; they're the real trouble that the close friends must gander and bond together to avoid any and all confrontation of the worst possible scenario of both the Prince Charming and his Cinderella getting separated for good. This is where the comedy aspect does its best, and it definitely gives the anime a stretch of what there's to offer about Junta Shima's writing, which is not just fast but exacerbating to a degree that is quick-witted and holds nothing back in a surprisingly non-cliche manner. In a way, it leverages into the otaku culture and the constant gag humour that is a part of its bizarre shtick just to get the romance vibes going, and I can't say that I hate it, but it did get some chuckles out of me at certain moments.Being the first of J.C.Staff's 9 shows for Summer/Fall 2024, I need not mention the Paper Mario-esque motion-comic that Hi Score Girl and Shinigami Bocchan to Kuro Maid a.k.a The Duke of Death and His Maid's director Yoshinobu Yamakawa took in his approach learning from fellow Gokushufudou director Chiaki Kon about literally ""cutting corners"" in animation by making the manga come alive only by colour and expression (I'm looking at you, Blue Lock vs. U-20 Japan). As mentioned, Gokushufudou got the bad apple of J.C.Staff going for the motion-comic style (and it's even ironic that its earlier Fall 2020 TV drama is leaps better than the anime), but for this show. it...kinda works? Sure, it's all over the place, but as I've mentioned, it depends on what the source material is like, and in this case, the motion-comic nomenclature perfectly suits the aethestic of Murai no Koi to a T. With Yoshinobu Yamakawa being able to add his own flavour into the anime, no matter how ""bad"" it looks, the other aspects help support the sole deal breaker so much that at the end of the day, animation takes a backseat for the main content to shine through.The OST is fairly lacking in spots, though it is just there for show and not really noticeable. Riinu's OP is especially catchy (that is if you speed the song up), and Yabai T-Shirts Ya-san's ED is a glorified mess of a mashup that has to do with the show's themes and genres, just plain forgettable. A mixed bag.If you want to try out Murai no Koi a.k.a Murai in Love, I'm sorry to say that you'll have to take J.C.Staff's motion-comic animation for what it is. I'll give it points for trying to stand out by taking a downgrade in one of the most critical aspects of anime, and in my case, it was a constant but consistent hit-or-miss experience.Maybe (or definitely) you'll have a better experience than I do, and at the end of the day, that's what counts as an opinion of not just one, but of the many."
Garakuta-doori no Stain,"Away from bustling streets of everyday people hastily making their way, past pitch black alleyways, and into dirty corridors occupied by a vast array of strange anthropomorphic animals, you’ll find yourself at a junkyard where the illustrious Mr. Stain resides. Sorry, did I say illustrious? I meant the complete opposite. Mr Stain is an unknown homeless man that spends his days scavenging the dirty junkyard for items he finds interesting. He’s joined alongside the many inhabitants of the back alley, but never in alliance with one another. For if something is found, everyone acts in their own selfish desires—often vile in executions for their own...greedy self-gain. This place is dirty, disgusting, and brazenly violent. Yet it’s behind this veil of disgust that Mr. Stain presents to us a surprising depth of humanity and relatability, the kind that pushes you out of your comfort zone and defies sensibilities. Well, at least that’s what I get out of Masuda Ryuuji’s work.Because yes that’s right, this is another work by Masuda Ryuuji, the creator of Popee the Performer, and one that is often overlooked compared to its predecessor. Airing just two years after Popee the Performer and a run of just 13 short episodes and a 30 minute OVA finale, Mr Stain builds itself a unique identity that somehow takes even more creative liberties than Popee the Performer. Rather than working within the restrictive limitations of its budget and software, Masuda builds upon the creative foundations he built during the production of Popee and expands on them to achieve even more of his bizarre ideas in Mr Stain. However before we get into that, I need to preface this review with a recommendation to read my Popee the Performer review if you haven’t, as it adds much needed context for this review.Upon starting the first episode of Mr. Stain, the first thing you’ll notice is the detailed background designs, atmospheric lighting and effects, and a multitude of objects occupying the space. This is in direct contrast to the limitations faced during the production of Popee the Performer which took place in a simple, flat desert plain. Masuda Ryuji wanted to make the world of Mr. Stain feels more alive and interesting, thus a meticulous focus is placed on set design and atmosphere.Alongside this focus on backgrounds is a significant improvement to the camerawork. Part of Masuda’s decision to place Mr. Stain amongst tall buildings is a desire to express a sense of physical space in animation, much like a camera does in live-action films. By utilising 3DCG, he’s able to easily convey this idea due to the camera being a literal physical object within that space. It goes without saying that traditional hand-drawn animation can achieve a similar effect, but it requires an immense amount of time and skill. By utilising computer technology, Masuda is able to bring his desired cinematic style into animation. As Masuda Ryuji puts it: “The main attraction of 3D CGI animation for me is the potential to combine the best elements of live-action camera work and animated expression. In simple terms, with 3D CGI, you can virtually build a set inside a computer, similar to stage design in live-action, and place a camera within it to move around. This allows for realistic camera movements—such as circling around a character or raising the camera like on a crane—enabling direction beyond simple cuts.” (Masuda, Oct2009). You can see the result of this in the first episode, for example, when Mr. Stain and his cat buddy (if you can even call them friends) Palvan enter a room. Instead of cutting away to a different shot, Masuda utilises the free flowing camera to crane upwards, showing the characters walking through windows, and up to the roof of the building, all in one seamless take. Mr. Stain constantly has shots where the camera circles around characters, such as in episode 2, which does a great job at establishing the surrounding area and showing unique angles and details you’d otherwise not see. All of this does wonders to bring the space occupied by Mr. Stain to life.This purposeful and meticulous focus on establishing a sense of space achieves realism, too. Unlike Popee the Performer, which indulges in its absurdity to form surrealist humour, Masuda attempts something completely different with Mr. Stain to achieve a similar level of surreality. The titular character, Mr. Stain, is deliberately designed with more human-like features; his movements are smooth and lively (in contrast to the rigid movements found in Popee the Performer); and he exhibits emotions and reactions the viewers can relate to. Mr. Stain is often portrayed acting illogically, such as in episode 3 where Mr. Stain falls in love with a portrait of a woman in a painting, to the extent that he’ll stop eating (and taking care of himself in general) to stare upon her figure for hours. Palvan attempts to please Mr. Stain by adding to the painting the image of Mr. Stain, but he becomes furious upon seeing himself, perhaps disgusted by his own image next to someone who, in his eyes, is perfect and beautiful. Enraged, he furiously rips apart the part of the painting that Palvan drew on, with a bloody hand from the broken glass shard he uses. This scene is raw in its disgust and incredibly uncomfortable to watch, and that’s the point. In Masuda’s own words: “People are emotional creatures. They tend to react emotionally more than logically. So rather than create designs written on paper, I have characters react emotionally - and interestingly - to the story.” (Masuda, 2006) With this idea in mind, Masuda is able to create characters that feel real. Characters you’ll find yourself genuinely compassionate towards. Characters who have a heart, in spite of the surrealist moments throughout the series. Masuda is also attempting to portray a “strange realism,” the kind that makes you feel uncomfortable on purpose to portray the rawness and brutality of this setting and these characters.To get an idea of what I’m saying, look no further than episode 4 where Mr. Stain finds a bird in a cage in the junkyard and, of course, tries to eat him, but he manages to escape. However, the bird then saves Stain from falling to his death, which leads to the two bonding with each other. But the bird died because of the change in season as it was a summer bird. So Mr. Stain violently chops up the bird, cooks it, and stuffs it in his mouth. Masuda talks about in an interview about how when he was young he would see chickens being chopped up this exact way, so he was very used to this kind of unapologetic violence.All of these scenes are disgusting and uncomfortable. Mr. Stain’s art is weird and gross. Yet everything is portrayed in a strangely real and relatable way—exactly what Masuda is trying to achieve. Characters that are morally questionable and disgusting, yet undoubtedly human. It’s able to tug at your heartstrings and make you genuinely care for these characters, even after (or during) these brutal and disgusting scenes. Alongside the art amplifying a sense of realism, everything makes for such a surreal experience. If I haven’t sold the idea that Mr. Stain is incredibly surreal yet, during the last scene of episode 2, the lizard that hung out with Mr. Stain and Palvan dies and his ghost rips a fat cigar right in front of their faces before ascending to heaven. Everything about Mr. Stain is batshit insane, yet the fact that it’s able to build a world and establish characters that feel relatable is impressive. I’ve got one more quote from Masuda to ponder: “I’ve always been drawn to stories where things don’t quite come together perfectly, often with an ironic twist. It’s something closer to Terry Gilliam’s style of humour [Monty Python] than to typical Hollywood movies. I also loved manga growing up and frequently read works like Phoenix by Osamu Tezuka. It’s not a happy-ending story—instead, it explores themes like life’s disjointedness and challenges. And because of that, the ‘fate’ that sweeps the protagonist along takes on a strange weight, a unique realism. It’s not just gritty; it’s more like a vastness that leaves you awestruck once you finish reading.” (Masuda, Oct2009).I find Mr. Stain to be a significant part of Masuda Ryuuji’s portfolio of 3DCG anime for all the reasons I’ve discussed in this review. He was able to more freely explore the wicked, and oftentimes grim, ideas he has. You can feel his creativity overflowing throughout Mr. Stain, be it through the characters or set pieces. It’s a shame that Mr. Stain is often overlooked in comparison to its significantly popular predecessor, since I believe it provides a similar level of crude and wicked absurdity that made Popee the Performer so charming in the first place.And to end on a similar note as my Popee the Performer review, Mr. Stain is the idea of rejecting your sensibilities and embracing unconventionality personified into a story. Mr. Stain is the kind of anime you can very easily dismiss on a surface level for its strange art style and disgusting story. Yet it’s exactly these aspects that challenge the viewer’s sensibilities, as it’s able to portray a surprising sense of humanity throughout its surrealism. It’s visceral, raw, and real, all of which makes for such a truly unique experience that I highly encourage anyone interested to try.

Isekai Ojisan,"This is a story about an uncle who comes from another world according to the title.Reminding those who want to watch this anime, don't take the isekai in this story too seriously. Although there are tsundere characters, isekai characters, isekai powers, unique abilities, because some story is filled with humor.I like this kind of story because it is very entertaining and makes me laugh. I really enjoy it from the beginning to the end of the episode filled with funny stories, funny dialogues, funny characters. Main characters Ojisan and Takafumi managed to make me very entertained in every episode. some unexpected plots also make the...story even better. Other characters like Fujimiya, Elf, Mabel, Alicia and her party also help the story become more interesting and of course there are many funny things. Musics, OP / ED are also good.Overall, highly recommended for people looking for entertainment, laughter, and funny stories."
86 Part 2,"Can an anime really go two for two? Absolutely.Initially, I thought this season might fall short compared to the last and while it lacks some of the elements that made the previous season truly unforgettable for me, it still holds up as a fantastic continuation.This season expands the world and dives deeper into the characters, individuals who have known nothing but war—forcing them to confront the question: what comes after? Their struggles and anxieties are evident as they grapple with the possibility of peace and among them stands a headless reaper, a complex character who, at his core, is just a boy trying to protect...his friends from death.The story takes a fresh direction, exploring new facets of this war-torn world, and it all builds to an incredible conclusion as both worlds finally collide (I cried like crazy). While I still consider Season 1 the stronger installment, this season was an outstanding follow-up, one I’d happily rewatch again and again."
"Sayounara Ryuusei, Konnichiwa Jinsei","Not bad, not amazing, and kind of weird.This is not a bad anime by any means, I have watched much worse than this, but there's also some much better anime then this too, and definitely ones that are less weird.Let me elaborate on each point.The Good:1. Really good animation quality for such an obscure anime, it's animation is really crisp, and bold, if can understand that. I almost find it to be a waste being used on this anime since it's so good.2. The story is somewhat bland & cliché and feels like a lot of this is a small harem, considering the few women...who like to follow the MC around. Now that isn't a forced plot point to this anime, more so it is a side detail, with the MC mainly just being another OP reincarnated MC who fights and protects his village. However, believe this; The MC actually has some values, and isn't a total sad loser or an awful douchebag?! Which is surprisingly rare with this type of anime for some reason. The story has a decent plot, which doesn't drag out, and the pacing is decent as well. The characters are a bit cliché, but they are good since they actually get a personality and are understandable in their actions and beliefs, with the MC having a good backstory to aid it all.The Bad:The positives, sometimes are the negatives. This is bland & cliché, so no matter the fact that I find this to be enjoyable, the story is something that could be put together by grabbing 6 reincarnation animes and shoving them into a blender, and filtering out the mediocre characterizations that you sometimes get. I wouldn't watch this if you have some other animes you have been looking at watching, since this is really just more of the same, with a little better animation and characters. That said, if you are bored, this is actually decent enough to keep you entertained, just keep in mind it isn't unique or magically special compared to anything else.The Ugly (aka, Weird):For some reason drinking in this anime revolves around milk. Now that wouldn't be anything I would care about, BUT for this anime it revolves around half human animals (see where I am going?), and the local drinking place is just a place where you drink a half cow/human's breast milk, which is also somebody's wife, and their daughter also gives out her milk too, see where I am going? This is kinda weird, and I agree with others that this seems like a disguised fetish of some kind. That said I don't think it ruins an entire anime over a 2 minute scene, but I wish that the producers would've just cut the scene entirely since it added almost nothing besides a moment to scratch your head and think ""Why am I watching an anime where people drink a half human/cow's breast milk"".6.5/10, truly a milky experience."
Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen,"Late review but i will review it.I have been waiting for the continuation of bleach anime since i finished reading the manga.Thank you, welcome back bleach, Ichigo. Thousand year blood war characters are finally animated. Hearing the voice of bankai again :)Voice, characters are very nostalgic, also new characters are very good animation in this season.Yhwach and the others, soul reaper, every episode i remember the manga storyline that i have finished reading and finally this has been animated it is very good. Also the fights in this season are very good.For newcomers so as not to be confused it is better to watch the...previous bleach seasonFor bleach fans it is highly recommendedContinue watching the next season"
Akira,"This was the first anime that I saw. I was in my teens and it got me pretty well hooked on realizing that animated does not mean for children.There really is no more violent a story I had seen before this one. The whole concept of magic and whatnot was pretty familiar to me but the psychic ability and metamorphosis that happens were really something that captured me right off the bat.There are scenes in the movie that some may find disturbing, but it does not pull any punches when it comes the level of sheer realism when someone with a deadly superpower is unleashed...on a city. Up until that point most of the superpower things that I had seen were all along the lines of Superman, Batman, and the whole cartoon lineup on Nickelodeon in the 90's, this was not the same.I know the movie is coming up on more than 35 years old now, but if you haven't seen it. Just watch it."
"Shijou Saikyou no Daimaou, Murabito A ni Tensei suru","A jumbled mess of over-the-top anime themes and tropes combined in a fast-paced story that attempts to meet too many story points. This show, to me, seems perfectly written for the content rating demographic of PG-13. The culmination of all aspects of this anime fit what I would expect a thirteen-year-old boy to enjoy and look for.The story behind the show is nothing unique but it isn’t bad, the problem is the execution. The pacing of the story feels awful which is not surprising given the twelve-episode length but even for a single cour anime this one feels bad. Due to the pacing issues...of the show many of the “side” characters or characters that are the focal point of “pivotal” scenes or events are simply that. Mainly one-off characters that serve a small purpose and then aren’t seen again. Many of the main events in the show just don’t feel very special or important. This can be seen tremendously in the last three episodes as these episodes focus on a world-threatening conflict, that boils down to the regret of the main character. The outcome of the conflict is not externally shown or even really reflected on by the main character, making the overall events seem unimportant and just like points on a checklist that need to be checked off.Another major flaw in the story can be seen via the synopsis of the show. The premises is supposed to be an overpowered “Demon Lord” reincarnates in a weaker state to find an equal that he can be friends with. At no point in the show does the main character state that he is weakened or give off the impression that he cannot use his full, pre-reincarnated, powers. The “equal” that he finds to be his friend is by no means an equal, she is a character that fits the same struggles he experienced in his previous life but even those struggles are only apparent until their relationship starts. The main character also supposedly wants to keep a low-profile but does nothing to do so, at every opportunity to hold back or fly under the radar the character does the opposite.Many of the characters and personalities in the show are boring or annoying. I don’t particularly mind flashy and repetitive characters commonly seen in rom-com anime, but this show was too much. All major characters of this show follow a standard anime trope or character-type, and many crank the dial to the max. Examples include your stereotypical bashful, jealous harem girl and your arrogant, domineering female warrior type. These are just two of many character types to expect in this show. I think both character types and even many of the others in the show are good when done properly but in this show many of them feel too literal in their representation of the character type and their template becomes their entire identity. By the end I felt no connection to any characters in the show and found myself really rooting for nobody.Sometimes a bad or niche anime can be saved by the power system or combat within, this is not one of those cases. The magic looks great and feels strong. I found myself thinking that a lot of the magic used would be cool to use in a video game. The system behind it is completely ignored outside of the first third of the show. The best “explanation” a form of magic gets in this show is, “that’s a lost technique” or “you can double cast?!?!” With some of the magical sequences in the show being extremely cool and story focused it is a real shame that the understanding is inferred rather than explained. On top of this, the sword combat is boring and unimpressive. All in all, the combat is rather bland outside of the main character’s magic.This show was not very enjoyable. It’s possible that as I have gotten older this sort of show doesn’t appeal to me anymore but with the poor story elements, over the top characters and themes, and lack of world or system building I just could not get into it. About half-way through I thought of just dropping it but stuck it out just in case to no avail. This show isn’t all bad as there are some funny moments but that is the pinnacle of the show, a few funny scenes."
Summertime Render,"im a fan of time travel anime, and i really liked how this series completed the whole story in only 25 episodes.i enjoyed the anime, but i put it on hold for a really long time (i stopped at episode 20) because there was something i just didn't like about it. after i finished it today, i realized what my problem with it was. i think there was too much exposition; from the start until the 24th episode, there was too much dialogue explaining what was happening instead of showing them to the audience, which i found dull or lazy. it felt like the show...was spoonfeeding me with information instead of making me think about how and why the events in the anime occurred. they even over-explain the plot twists.additionally, the last episode was full of plotholes. though the ep's purpose might just be to give the audience a proper conclusion to the story, so i didn't dwell on it that much.don't get me wrong, it was an enjoyable anime and i recommend others to watch it so they can judge it themselves. it's a good anime to start with for time travel fans.overall, i'd rate it between 7/10."
Koi wa Futago de Warikirenai,"As a man, I don't like what the MC did. It will just hurt them all in the long run, I know making decision is hard, I know choosing between the two is hard but as a man you need to make a decision. You can't say ""I love you both, so wait for my answer"", that's a total BS move. Don't come saying you need time, you 3 are freaking childhood friends, the MC have a lot of time to decide by that time. Even if we count the age of the 3, the MC can still decide.Sometimes in life you have to...choose, you can't make a stand still, it is given someone will get hurt but if you prolong it, all will get hurt, so man up and decide.For making this kind of ending has just put the effort of the 2 in a sour end and making the MC a coward jerk. If this end is just a continuation for a new season for them to finish this, then I will be happy to score this higher and write a more appealing review, for now this is my stance."
Jurassic!,"Although this is just a 1 minute short, you can really tell it has the Megumi Ishitani touch.She later directed some of the most beloved One Piece episodes (including One Piece Fan Letter) and is one of the best directors in Toei. My understanding is that this was one of her first projects, and you can already see her incredible vision for coloring and ""softness"".Aside from the visuals, the time constrain of 1 minute makes it hard to tell any complete story, but it does a suprisingly good job at conveying one anyway. Just a typical boy-meets-girl with pretty visuals and a lot of dinosaurs/pre-historic...animals.It's just 1 minute long, so it's worth a watch."
Clannad: After Story,"Clannad: After Story (from now on called After Story) is a decent step up from Clannad. The boring high school setting is replaced with an adult setting. For some reason, it is very rare to find a romance anime that isn't in a school or university setting. The decision to have Tomoya working in After Story already sets it apart from other anime. It's no longer about school festivals and whatnot, it's about starting a family.The downside of After Story is that it doesn't shake off a lot of its issues during Clannad. There are still repeated unnecessary gags. In fact, some of these gags...continue from Clannad which is embarrassing. The first half is just not bad, but not good either. Nagisa is still flat and boring while Tomoya carries the story forward.Even though the execution leaves much to be desired, the fresh setting at least allows me to see things that aren't in other romcoms. I would say most of the show is somewhere around a 6.5. However, what pushes the show to a 9 for me are several key moments where everything comes together. If After Story was rated on these moments alone, it would be an untouchable masterpiece. The core of After Story's enjoyment is several very strong, very emotional climaxes.I say this as someone who never feels emotional watching a show or a movie. I had a pokerface during Iron Giant and every movie you could think of. I didn't give a crap during the dog scene in FMAB. But several key moments in After Story caught me by surprise. For that alone, I will never regret watching the show. It was worth sitting through the garbage dump that is the first Clannad.With that said, I think it's a risky recommendation because if you don't feel anything during those scenes, you might not enjoy After Story. Therefore, decide based on this information."
"Party kara Tsuihou sareta Sono Chiyushi, Jitsu wa Saikyou ni Tsuki","Welcome to ""They Thought I Was Weak But Im Actually a Sigma"" #542. As usual, The moustache twirling old party members are irredeemable assholes. ""Can you go unalive yourself right now?"", they tell average safely-written main character. Let's call the main character John because I can't be bothered to even look up his actual name. It's not worth remembering. John replies with ""Hahaha you are so funny"" because he is Gandhi and he forgives his enemies. His newly acquired waifu gets angry on his behalf. His old party members start being aggressive towards her and we get the classic ""You can insult me but not...my blue haired loli.""What did you think of that parody? Actually that wasn't a parody, that actually happened.These shows sometimes sound like parodies of themselves. It is insane how unremarkable and predictable this is. At the start of watching this, I imagined the most basic, common denominator plot just to compare the show against that. As I watched more, I realized my imagined plot is exactly what the show is. I imagine you will have the same experience."
Gakkou no Kaidan,"Ghost Stories is one of the most bizarre yet unforgettable anime experiences, not for its original content, but for the sheer audacity of its English dub. While the Japanese version is a fairly average supernatural series aimed at children, its English adaptation by ADV Films flipped the script entirely. Granted free creative reign due to the show's poor reception in Japan, the dub team transformed the series into an irreverent, self-aware comedy packed with absurd humour, pop culture references, and off-the-wall dialogue that often had little to do with the original story. The result is a chaotic parody that unapologetically pokes fun at itself, other...anime, and Western media. While not for everyone due to its edgy humour, the Ghost Stories dub has earned its place as a cult classic, delivering an experience that’s more memorable for its comedic audacity than its plot. It’s an anime like no other—equal parts trainwreck and comedic genius."
School Days,"School Days is sometimes praised for being a takedown of the harem genre, and for its parallels to Shakespeare. Yet Puella Magi Madoka Magica is a Shakespeare-esque deconstruction of magical girls, and it's no good. What makes School Days great is not its relationship to other art but its precise depiction of teenage neuroses. If director Keitaro Motonaga wanted merely to skewer harem tropes and punish his characters for their immorality, they would not have been portrayed so compassionately.School Days portrays the unique tragedy of early high school, where children barely more mature than they were a few years earlier are suddenly acting like...adults. Sekai initially seems friendly but flirtatious, even slightly suspicious. The reality of the situation is revealed by her lifelong best friend who says ""Sekai is the type of person who cries for hours when she's sad"". One realizes that Sekai's sexual forwardness is an attempt by a sweet, outgoing girl to channel her natural extroversion into something ""cooler"", less ""embarrassing"". It's affecting because it's believable; who didn't know a girl in middle school who cried over everything? Each character is revealed for the middle schooler they are beneath their high school clothing. The ED shows the smiling faces of the cast at their best, a frequently heart-wrenching contrast to the shadows of their former selves seen just moments prior. Even Makoto, the sex-fiend protagonist, becomes sympathetic in moments when the show reminds that not so long ago he was a normal, kind boy. The ensemble cast allows the series to tackle many of the different ways people fall into hurting themselves and others sexually. Motonaga manages to save devil-may-care nihilism, one of the most obvious causes of sexual irresponsibility, for a brief conversation between three nameless side characters. Our named characters have thornier motivations.Despite the sympathetic perspective, no character is alleviated of responsibility for their mistakes. School Days achieves some of Robert Bresson's aim to make the audience feel the omnipresence of God. Each decision feels moral, even apocalyptic, with every wrong move being physically painful to watch. The series is constantly gripping and substantial because one is made to remember that every action has consequences. One female character sees a play after committing a secret, devastating, emotional crime. ""Do you believe that if no one was to hear your words, you could get away with anything?"" one of the masked actors says. The girl, in response, disappears. It is a frightening moment, but it also inspires self reflection. An especially painful juxtaposition occurs when Makoto breaks a girl's heart, and is visibly about to apologize and comfort her, but instead, for no clear reason, chooses to walk away. His neglect of his natural, human inclination towards goodness is excruciatingly true to life.School Days is not a well animated series, and even sadly contains two episodes full of Ecchi through the use of unfortunate angles. Despite all the sex in the series, however, none of it is lingered on or portrayed in a titillating manner. Motonaga is a sneakily poetic filmmaker. A kiss timed to the wonderful ending song of the second episode is a primer for gasps to come. A POV shot of Sekai guiltily glancing down at her feet is damning; raindrops falling on Kotonoha's phone is crushing; a fireside dance intended to begin a relationship takes on a bittersweet fondness when it is revealed it is actually the end of one. One particular act of violence spills black blood, a chilling counterpoint to the glowing ketchup present in the Kara no Kyoukai films. The show is full of montages, and don't be surprised when emotions well up while watching them. In School Days, they are far from a way to easily condense information.None of the series reads like build-up because every episode is climactic, but the characters still feel far more than they say, and those feelings have to come out at some point. School Days is very dramatic, yet crucially no one sheds tears until they absolutely cannot help it. When the tears finally fall, one gasps both for the believability of the performances and the candor of their confessions. The final episode is famous for obvious reasons, but pay attention to the final dialogue scene, in which Sekai admits her rationale for kicking off the entire plot. Her explanation is catharsis for all the shattered hearts in the series, and ours too."
Tokidoki Bosotto Russia-go de Dereru Tonari no Alya-san,"Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in RussianRating: 7/10Some shows hook you with their premise, others with their execution. For me, Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian falls somewhere in between. With its charming blend of tsundere antics, cultural quirks, and slow-burn romance, it’s the kind of anime that feels like a guilty pleasure—but one you don’t actually feel that guilty about.The Premise: A Quirky Twist on High School RomanceThe story revolves around Alisa Mikhailovna “Alya” Kujo, a half-Russian high school girl who hides her true feelings behind cryptic comments in Russian. Our protagonist, Masachika Kuze, is her laid-back, somewhat clueless classmate who understands every...word she says—but keeps it to himself.This setup isn’t groundbreaking, but it’s unique enough to stand out in the overcrowded high school romance genre. It’s a dynamic that creates plenty of fun misunderstandings, heartfelt moments, and just enough tension to keep you invested.Why It Worked for MeAlya’s Personality: Alya is a classic tsundere, but the Russian twist gives her character a refreshing edge. Her sharp tongue, coupled with her vulnerable moments when she thinks no one understands her, makes her endearing rather than overbearing.The Russian Factor: Let’s be real—anime with multilingual elements is rare, and the inclusion of Russian adds a unique flavor here. The show doesn’t overuse it; it’s sprinkled in just enough to highlight Alya’s personality and background. Plus, hearing those soft Russian phrases? Chef’s kiss.Masachika’s Chill Energy: Unlike the dense male leads we’ve come to expect in romance anime, Masachika is surprisingly perceptive (at least when it comes to Alya). His decision to keep his understanding of Russian a secret makes him more interesting—there’s a quiet cleverness to him that balances Alya’s fiery energy.The Slow Burn: The show thrives on subtlety. It doesn’t rush the romance, instead letting the relationship grow through small, meaningful interactions. Every glance, every playful jab, and every rare moment of vulnerability feels significant.Where It StumbledLimited Scope: The story is very character-focused, which is great—but it doesn’t do much to expand beyond its central duo. The side characters exist, but they rarely get meaningful development or time to shine.Repetitive Humor: While the banter between Alya and Masachika is fun, it does get a bit repetitive. The same teasing dynamic plays out in different settings, and after a while, you start wishing for a little more variety.Missed Opportunities: Alya’s Russian heritage is a great hook, but it isn’t explored as deeply as it could be. I wanted to see more about how her cultural background affects her relationships or her perspective, but the anime keeps it mostly surface-level.How It Felt Watching ItWatching this anime was like enjoying a warm cup of tea on a chilly evening. It’s not the most intense or memorable experience, but it’s comforting and sweet in its own way. Alya and Masachika’s interactions kept me smiling, and there were even moments that made me pause and go, “Okay, that’s cute.”That said, it’s not the kind of show that leaves a lasting impression. It’s enjoyable in the moment, but once it’s over, you might not feel compelled to revisit it.Why I Gave It a 7/10Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian gets a 7/10 from me because it’s good—but not great. It’s charming, it’s fun, and it has a unique twist, but it doesn’t quite push itself far enough to stand out as something truly special.It’s the kind of anime I’d recommend to fans of lighthearted romance or anyone looking for a relaxing watch with just a touch of cultural flair. But if you’re expecting a deep dive into character development or an unforgettable love story, you might walk away feeling a bit underwhelmed.Would I Recommend It?Absolutely—if you’re in the mood for something cute, simple, and slightly off the beaten path. Alya’s sharp wit and Masachika’s quiet charm make for a delightful duo, and the sprinkling of Russian culture adds just enough novelty to keep things interesting."
Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!,"I cannot, with a good conscience, give this anime anything higher than a 6. It’s awful, degenerate, and grossly self-aware. And yet, as much as I will decry the endless fanservice (and the entire episode dedicated to it), I still found myself somehow enjoying the stupid and immature comedy. Say what you will about my own shallowness that I could enjoy the perverted and overused jokes, but that's how it was. Honestly, it was more like a ""wtf, so THIS is how far they'll go"" moment every time the show surprised me with an even deeper level of depravity. Naturally, the character writing and plot...development are unceremoniously thrown right out the window from the start, but whatever remains still manages to be begrudgingly funny.Final Rating: 6"
Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken 3rd Season,"This season had classic Slime action, silliness, drama, politics, etc., but was unfortunately also chock full of filler or at least filler-adjacent scenes. It's still good, but ""mixed"" implies that some viewers will not enjoy this, and I genuinely believe that. I personally had to watch some episodes at 2x speed in order to tolerate all the forced feel-good moments and stretched out dialogues.The first 12 episodes seemed to have much more thought put into them. The plot seemed focused, the pacing was perfect, and any serious moment had tiny little silent gags carefully inserted in the background, like the production team was having...a good time making it. In other words, the classic Tensura experience.The latter 12 episodes were completely different. The pacing seemed almost glacial and many scenes felt forced. 2-minute scenes that took 5 minutes, accompanied by inspirational music cues and random smiles from characters that are barely involved in the scene (and not in an ironic way), it was honestly exhausting at times. Granted, part of the charm of Slime is the circle-jerky nature of it, especially earlier on. But it wasn't as charming this time around. Perhaps the power creep is getting to it and things just don't feel as grand anymore given all that's happened.  Or perhaps those scenes were just written worse this time around, or both. Regardless, it was rather disappointing.I can only hope that poor time management made them rush the last 12 episodes and that's why the quality dropped, otherwise I'm not setting expectations too high for season 4.8.5/10 for the first 12 episodes, 5.5/10 for the last 12 episodes. Overall, 7/10."
Ragna Crimson,"glad to say I was pleasantly suprised with what this show had to offer, which at first glance didn't seem like much.a classic case of dont judge a book by it's cover. in this case, the cover being the generic artstyle and boring animation, as well as the too common fantasy world withh dragons, hunters, magic etc.the lore was suprisingly deeper than I thought. most of the time, it seemed like the author actually had a plotline in mind while writing the story. keyword: most of the time. yeah the story isn't that unique, but still had enough stand out charactaristics to differentiate itself...from the flock.the characters were probably the best part of this show and the only reason i'd made it through.  many side-characters had well made suspenseful moments and dialoges throughout the series.particullarly crimson, who was actually an unpredictable character felt like he fit his role perfectly. lia was also a great character that quickly became my favorite. on the topic of side characters, some backgrounds felt shoved as a minute long flashback, but as a 24 ep season with a decent sized array of characters, i think it was juggled decently well,  as far as power fantasies do atleast. some plotholes and weird writing are present but kept to a minimum, which should 'mostly' be resolved in later seasons.the production was meh and very rough in most fight scenes, but the animation isn't the reason anyone would choose to watch this show for. atleast the voice acting is good.the pacing is somewhat choppy, while it seemed the show would take the continuous action and motion route in the begining, the pacing quickly takes a halt and deaccelarates immensly in later arcs, which does kill the momentum. the major fights are painstakingly slow and feel like a chore to get through sometimes, but there are definitly hype moments that grab you from the skip button.overall this show was definitly enjoyable and a good waste of time i could've used to work on my life instead of watching 2d charcters talk in japanese all day."
Grand Blue,"Had too much of shounen? its time to deep dive into the ocean(quite literally) with Grand blue!It cannot get any funnier this anime. 12 episodes are just too less for a hilarious anime such as this. Each episode is packed with laughter. Try your best not to watch it on a big screen (the men just love going skinny-dipping in the ocean). Its a highly recommended slapstick comedy anime.Anything can happen any second, u really need to keep your eyes wide open to get the best views of swimsu- (cough_cough) of the wacky antics happening above the ocean and below it too.We could have definitely...seen more participation from some characters but i guess that's the restriction of our limited number of episodes. Overall, this anime is unique even in cliche moments, thus distinguishing it from any other Comedy-genre anime."
Katsute Mahou Shoujo to Aku wa Tekitai shiteita.,"If you like cute and heart warming anime series this is the best, if you do not like this is the worst. I loved it but if you are not into this genre you will be bored. Voice actings are masterpiece, can be the best ı have ever seen. Animations are very good but the art style is a bit different so you may not like it but as ı say animations are very good. Story is not the strongest weapon of this serie the character dynamics is. That mean if you can not bound to characters you cant enjoy the anime."
Hibike! Euphonium 3,I just really don't understand why they only gave the third and finall year only 13 damn episodes. You'd think they would've learned after the second year movie and the backlash it received.Year 3 still isn't as bad as year 2 but what really makes it so depressing is that the number of episodes really is the core problem. Every arc feelt rushed and most characters lacked the brilliant characterization of year one (which had more than double the episodes to play with).It' still worth a watch for any fan but because of how much I anticipated this third and final year I must say...it's probably one of the biggest dissappointments of any animes I've watched.
Noragami,"""Noragami"" - this is the anime that you will never regret watching. Yes, the plot in the first season is not developed yet, it is only outlined, and it is done quite reasonably and logically. Most of the story is to be expected in the second season. But that doesn't mean that the first season is made up of useless fillers. Each episode is designed to draw you in easily and enjoyably. You really see the lives of almost real, existing people, who have a lot of difficulties and problems, the solution of which requires effort and means as well as human participation.The main...character, Hiyori, is neither a living nor a dead girl with a typical shoujo heroine character, very similar to Nanami from ""Nice to Meet You, Kami-sama"". While they share some similarities in appearance and a desire to help others, their personalities are quite different. Hiyori is gradually revealed as a brave and determined girl who can go into hulk-break mode when necessary, which doesn't spoil her in the slightest.The second of the three protagonists is the homeless and suddenly hyper-responsible butcher god Yato, who will do anything for five yen and a prayer: he can get rid of mould in your bathroom, find your lost cat, or even save the world. The fixed cost of donations doesn't affect the quality of the work, which the hapless and forgotten Kami-sama literally hunts down, resorting to petty hooliganism on the subway and in the streets - spray-painting walls to advertise his services. The best thing about this character is his design, which looks fresh and original. It is unlikely that you will ever forget this character, especially because of his literally magical eyes, whose blue colour conquers the hearts of fans.The third of the protagonists is the weaponised soul of a vicious and capricious boy named Yukine, whose charming appearance melts women's hearts. You'll hate him for a while, because troubled teenagers are generally no fun, but then he'll be brought up properly, rest assured. And yes, the strength of this boy is once again his original and memorable design.The supporting characters are also quite original, just listen: there's the goddess of poverty, who appears as a cute and intriguing young woman; a harsh female inquisitor in a mistress costume, which would delight any masochist; a tough man who transforms into a lace fan to create chaos and devastation...And there's more.Music. The music in this anime is breathtakingly beautiful and so natural, as if it was created specifically for this anime. It adds colorful accents and creates a distinct atmosphere, making the pathos scenes more impactful than in the original manga.Animation. Animators show wonders of skill, working meticulously on details. The characters never lose things in their hands, and the directors never forget to give a few extra seconds to objects that fall, break, scatter, tear, borrow, etc. The colouring of the world of ""Noragami"" is simply impressive, it speaks of a special style that you will later recognise from a thousand. The landscapes, the temples, the animation of phenomena and magic are all masterpieces. This is a massive work, hidden behind the light and smooth movements, but it becomes apparent when you take a closer look. Personally, I was struck by the complete synchronisation of lips and voice, the vivid facial expressions and fluid movements, the gracefulness of the transitions, which are imperceptible to the eye but speak volumes about the quality of this anime."
Youkai Gakkou no Sensei Hajimemashita!,"Aside from the fact that the teacher is a pervert and probably should be behind bars by nowThis anime offers a unique blend of comedy and unconventional storytelling that sets it apart from the typical seasonal lineup of magical girl shows, pure isekais, and overly familiar harem tropes. While the premise might initially feel controversial due to the behavior of the teacher, which could be a deal-breaker for some viewers, the story grows more engaging as the students begin to form an unexpected bond with the character. The humor is lighthearted, and the series gradually becomes enjoyable once you push past the first couple of...episodes.Though it’s still incomplete, I’d give it a solid 7.6 so far."
God Mazinger,I Dropped it after just 3 eps. Pretty boring ..The only thing that was somewhat okay was the mech itself and that alone. The anime tries combing mech/isekai which it does pretty horrible . Honestly just watch the other mazinger anime’sHonestly if u like mecha maybe don’t watch this it’s a pretty boring mecha anime . Plus it follows a villan of the week formula which some feels boring in this anime . The other mazinger anime do a better job.Boring dinosaurs aswell.This mazinger anime is probably weakest anime out all of the mazinger franchise .  It makes all of...the mazinger anime look masterpieces……
Another,"The concept and the plot is pretty good. It is a good combination of mystery and horror. The mystery isn't the cheap kind where they withdraw most information from the viewer and then the main character pulls it out of his ass. When the conclusion was reached, I felt like it made sense and was possible to predict from the information given.My biggest complaint is the characters. The main character is extremely stupid. A lot of the time, you will end up screaming at the screen for him to ask very obvious questions. This results in the plot being stuck in the same place for...several episodes just because the characters are too stupid to ask the obvious.The character personalities aren't that interesting either. They do their part, but you don't really feel attached to any of them. However, at least they aren't painfully cliche like the average harem. I felt neutral towards them. I also didn't feel sad when any of them died either. I only felt sympathy for the ones that died in a painful way."
Perfect Blue,"I will start with the negatives because I can fit them into a few sentences. It's true that a psychological thriller needs time, but it still felt a tad slow for the most part. The plot isn't dense enough to warrant that much runtime so I wish more was happening. If you are impatient, you might not like this.However, as an impatient person, I still very much enjoyed Perfect Blue. I think the problem the main character faces is pretty relatable. The atmosphere feels pretty uncomfortable and empty the whole time. Even when she's in the city, it feels like help is very far away...from the perspective of Mima. It's very nice to transfer that feeling just through sounds and scenery. The climax felt really creepy, which is impressive when done with animation rather than live action special effects.If you don't mind slow psychological thrillers, you will probably like this."
Enen no Shouboutai,"Fire force really gets wayyyy too much hate honestly, actually fire show that is probably worth giving 3 episodes to anyone.Art/animation - 9/10 exceptional animation all througout, some supreme fight scenes and great looking experiments with the colour pallete. Character designs are always good and smooth when fighting, only major issue with the animation is the main issue everyone has with fire force and that is the fan service, alot of it just doesnt make sense and only lets me down whenever it happens. Even as someone not opposed to fanservice the wild nature of it in this show doesn't fit. There is a time...and a place.Characters - 9/10  Shinra is a seriously great main character who gets some amazing development. The enitire crew all just seem like really good people to be around, you can always feel their love between eachother and it lifts the mood alot to see people getting along soo well.Sound design - 10/10 holy shit the sounds are earbreaking in the best way, the best way to describe it is as if it is a hollywood movie or a large blockbuster such as top gun, all the actions sound intense and add to the scale of the fights. the way the bass drops is soo different and should be incorporated into other high action animes. The openings and endings are also peak as hell.Story - 6/10 Now the story is probably weeker than the typical shounen anime but it isnt bad, just feels kind of slow at some times and largely carried by the characters and the animation. The story does have some pretty high highs and no very low lows but lots of mid story wise.Enjoyment - 7/10 The start hooked me but towards the end it started to lose me until the end where It caught me again, it was pretty consistent when I could bring myself to watch it and always had a good time seeing whatever was going down.overall 7/10"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"I have mixed feelings because a lot of minor complaints add up. FMAB is a jack of all trades, master of none. This is amazing if you compare it to the average shonen. However, there are true masterpieces that are more deserving of the top spot. Not to mention that there are shows out there that completely break the norm. FMAB doesn't break the norm, it just rises above it slightly.First of all, I think the superpower system is pretty average. The law of equal exchange might have been interesting on paper, but in the show it's just Edward putting his hand on the floor...and shooting rocks at people. Similarly, Roy just shoots fire but in the show he has a circle on his glove. That's two people whose superpower is ""shoot stuff at you"".The characters are weird because the more important the character, the less interesting they are. My favorites weren't the Elrics or Roy Mustang, it was Hawkeye or Hughes. However, most of the cast is pretty average.The ending of the story is pointless. You spend 64 episodes watching the Elrics run around the world trying to fix their problem, but none of their side-quests really matter for their end objective. It feels like the story of the side characters is what actually matters, not the Elrics.This is made worse by the fact that some arcs seem pointless from the start. The Elrics get dragged into side quests that last a pretty long time, achieve nothing, don't tell a relevant story, and aren't that interesting anyways. You see the start of an arc and think ""is it really important to do this right now?"" and sometimes the answer is no.The show is fine, I just wish it wasn't hyped so much. It made me expect more than the show really offers."
Romantic Killer,"Netflix if you cancel one more good show I am going to lose my mind.I was bored and wanted something nice and simple, like any typical shoujo, to entertain myself. And then I stiumbled upon this anime, not expecting much. You can imagine my surprise when I became glued to my seat, binging the whole thing in one go.I really enjoyed the whole plot surrounding the romance in this anime, I think its much better than the romance itself, with plot twists and complicated backstories as well as recurring trauma/issues. The romance itself was lackluster, I wanted a little more of it but I didn't...mind much because of how good the actual plot is.However, I will say the male leads just felt like they were multiplying for no real reason because all of us knew that other than the first two, the competition was nonexistent, and those last male characters just felt like background characters who accidentaly got pushed to front row. But we can easily forget this as they aren't brought up very often or seen as serious competition.I really wish I could see more of it, to know what comes after those cliff hangers and continue the story, but allas I won't.I definetely recommend this to anyone looking for a sorta dark and very interesting shoujo anime."
Dragon Ball Daima,"I wasn’t thrilled when Dragon Ball Daima was announced, thinking it might be a placeholder before the next Super season. But it quickly proved itself—and it only gets better with every episode.The characters are handled with care, staying true to the personalities and growth we’ve seen across Dragon Ball, Z, GT, Super, and the movies. It’s a pleasure to see them react naturally to the story rather than being forced into plot-driven choices.The animation strikes a great balance between nostalgic charm and modern quality, and while the story has familiar beats, the execution keeps it engaging. It’s clear this was made with fans in mind....Highly recommended."
MF Ghost 2nd Season,"This show is not worth watching, i have never seen that unlikable characters, like ever. In the 7 Episode it sinked to me that i do not care who wins, Bauckenber or Sawatari, Blue Alpine or that White porshe, i do not care, i dislike them both i dislike almost every driver, they do not have soul, they are plain as minecraft flat world. Stupid Cameos that are here for Nostalgia. This whole show looks terrible and the colors are washed up for no reason. It suited the Intial D, because it looked retro, like a distant memory. The cars looks good. The soundtrack is...there, i must admit that only watched this show because of that soundtrack and nothing else. I wanna drop this show. I am incredibly disappointed, i was looking for this show for soo long. I think the characters deserved more room and author should give them some good and likeble atributes ig, like for example Sawatari, the kid who dates girls only to dumped them, when they turn 17 ? Give him some redemption quality. For example he is sorry for that 17 thing, but he cannot help him self, but that girl and with some mentoring he is able to overcome that, and make sure we know that from the start that he is sorry and he is actually trying."
Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero,"I remember that after seeing the first trailer for this movie, I was genuinely worried about its visuals. The CGI didn't impress me. The next clip, released some time later, looked better, but I was still unsure if CGI was the right choice for a movie belonging to the Dragon Ball franchise, especially after such marvelous spectacle that the Broly movie was. It was quite intriguing and worrysome to hear that the next Dragon Ball movie wouldn't be made in a 2D technique, but would be a CGI movie instead.Well, it appears that, at least for the Super Hero movie, CGI turned out better than...good. It looked simply awesome and offered detailed models, smooth animation, a good color palette, and stunning special effects (including those you can see when characters are powering up). I can understand that it might take a while to get used to it (longer or shorter, depending on a viewer's tolerance towards CGI), but at least in my case, it didn't take long to get used to it and stop noticing it, as if the movie was done in the same way as all the previous Dragon Ball movies.The story focuses on Gohan and Piccolo, offering a refreshing change from the usual Goku and Vegeta-centric narratives. It was a pleasure to see a movie dedicated to other beloved characters, especially those that many fans (including me) have wished to see in the spotlight.Super Hero's first half might feel a bit slow at times, but such pacing is understandable, given the need to introduce new characters and establish their motivations or goals. While a more dynamic approach wouldn't have hurt, of course, the slower pace was appropriate for setting up the main plotline.While in general I don't consider this movie superior to the one about Broly, I admit that in terms of soundtrack it's on a slightly higher level. Not that much better, but I could memorize more tracks from it than from the Broly movie, including the main theme. They also felt more fitting to the general vibe offered by Super Hero. Hearing all the effects amplified by speakers at the cinema was simply a fantastic experience.In terms of fighting choreography, the element that's very important when talking about anything related to this franchise, Super Hero might be the best Dragon Ball movie ever created. The action scenes were filled with intricate details and complexity, whether it was hand-to-hand combat or ki attacks. The well-directed fights, set against beautiful landscapes, were surely a visual treat for one's eyes.Definitely, Super Hero is worth watching, and I'm saying it as a person who was not initially hyped. With its blend of humor, action, stunning visuals, and a great soundtrack, it's sure to entertain Dragon Ball fans of all kinds. I had fun both while watching it for the first time in the theater and re-watching it at home some months later.Note: I originally reviewed this movie on September 13, 2022. However, after re-reading it two years later, I decided to make several improvements. As a result, I deleted the old review and submitted this revised version. I consider the new version way better than the old one."
"Hachi-nan tte, Sore wa Nai deshou!","The 8th Son? Are You Kidding Me?Rating: 5/10Sometimes, you stumble across an anime with a title so bizarre it immediately grabs your attention. The 8th Son? Are You Kidding Me? is exactly that kind of show—quirky, intriguing, and full of potential. Unfortunately, while it starts strong, it quickly loses its way, leaving you with a mix of frustration and faint amusement.The Premise: Off to a Good StartThe story begins with Shingo Ichinomiya, a modern-day office worker, waking up in the body of Wendelin, a young boy in a fantasy world. Sounds familiar, right? It’s yet another isekai, but this time with a twist: Wendelin isn’t...the hero of a prophecy or the heir to a great kingdom—he’s the eighth son of a struggling noble family. This setup had so much promise, hinting at a refreshing underdog story.Initially, I was hooked. The whole “nobility with no resources” angle felt like it could bring some fresh challenges to the isekai formula. Wendelin’s discovery of his magical abilities and his struggle to rise above his family’s financial woes were intriguing... for about three episodes.What Worked (Kind of)Decent Worldbuilding: The fantasy world is fairly well thought out, with its own political systems, magical hierarchies, and societal struggles. It’s not groundbreaking, but it’s functional enough to keep you interested at the start.The Animation: The visuals are serviceable, with some solid designs for magical effects and landscapes. It’s nothing breathtaking, but it doesn’t feel cheap either.Wendelin’s Magic: Watching Wendelin master his magical abilities and rise to prominence had its moments, especially early on.What Didn’t Work (And There’s a Lot)Where do I start?Pacing Issues: The story rushes through its most interesting arcs. Just as you start getting invested in Wendelin’s struggles, the show jumps ahead to him being a prodigy with wealth and status. The rags-to-riches journey happens so fast that it feels completely unearned.Flat Characters: Wendelin is likable enough, but he’s surrounded by a supporting cast that barely registers. Most of his companions feel like cardboard cutouts fulfilling generic fantasy tropes—loyal knight, flirty healer, and so on. None of them stand out or have meaningful development.Lack of Depth: For a show with such a unique premise, it doesn’t dig deep into its themes. The idea of being the “8th son” barely factors into the story after the initial setup. It’s just another isekai with a magic-wielding protagonist who becomes overpowered way too quickly.Inconsistent Tone: The anime doesn’t seem to know what it wants to be. At times, it tries for lighthearted humor; at others, it attempts serious political intrigue. The result is a messy, uneven narrative that struggles to hold your attention.My Experience Watching ItWatching this anime felt like going on a hike where the trail starts off scenic and full of promise but quickly turns into a boring slog. By the halfway point, I was just waiting for it to end. That’s not to say it’s completely unenjoyable—there are a few fun moments scattered throughout. But those moments are rare and not enough to make up for the lackluster story.Why I Gave It a 5/10To me, a 5/10 is the definition of “meh.” The 8th Son? Are You Kidding Me? isn’t terrible—it’s watchable, and if you’re new to isekai or not too picky, you might even enjoy it. But for someone like me, who’s seen their fair share of isekai, it’s painfully average. It had the potential to be something unique, but it settled for being just another face in the crowd.Would I Recommend It?If you’re desperate for an isekai fix and have nothing better on your watchlist, give it a shot. Otherwise, there are plenty of other shows (Re:Zero, Mushoku Tensei, or even The Rising of the Shield Hero) that do what this anime tries to do but much better."
Odd Taxi,"At a first glance, this anime might be easily to look over due to its premise of character designs. However, its stylistic choice, is well, just that. Odd Taxi is different from other “furry fandom works,” since it has no plot about any sort of dichotomy between different species of animals. Its choice of characters being anthropomorphic animals has little relevance to the show. The relevance that it does have plays a major part in resolving any lose ends or questions the viewer may have. There is one element these anime typically share though, which is some type of close connection between two characters. Odd...Taxi doesn’t stray too far from this concept, though it would be best to leave this description as a vague semblance to these other “works.” Much of its thrill doesn’t come from the story itself, which is why watching watching one episode wouldn't be enough to satisfy some people. Its enjoyment is rewarded through uncovering Odd Taxi’s mystery as the story progresses. So, once the art feels familiar, the design choice of the cast should become ingraining.Odd Taxi tries to be a lot of things, but it could essentially be boiled down to a mystery thriller drama. The nature of these genres leads to most of the plot’s trend towards spoiler territory. So, the plot in this paragraph is mostly the bare bones of it. The setting takes place in Tokyo, though not the wealthiest area, since everyone seems to be in financial ruin. Everyone has some sort of secret or goal that they want to pursue to escape the mundaneness of modern life. The center of all of this is a seemingly atypical taxi driver named Odokawa. He seems to be rather content with his job as a taxi driver, either due to apathy or his close-minded nature. Part of the interest in this character is seeing what motivates a man who is unmotivated. He is a man who suffers from some form of an unfulfilled mid-life crisis. A man, who in stark contrast with the other characters, draws attention to himself for the sole fact of his reserved nature contrasts with the rest of the cast. The nature of his job leads him to meet with these eccentric people who just so happen to drag him along. Encounters with these recurring characters, which may seem unimportant, leave behind details that make the ending feel more complete. Additionally, Odd Taxi provide smaller details as a reward for those who pay close attention. It is not one of those shows where turning the brain off is the best to enjoy it.Most of its story relies on this characters, and much so to the point of its story more so being a series of events to show how these characters are relevant to the plot. Odd Taxi’s story is not linear, and entire episodes can be dedicated to the development of these characters. And much to their dismay, Odd Taxi does this quite well. Some of these background characters can be even more entertaining than Odokawa, whose schizoid nature could be off-putting for some people. Much of this though depends on how much screen time the characters get. Excluding the comedy duo “homo sapiens,” (they were irrelevant) I found these characters to influence Odokawa in some way. Many of the characters that largely annoy him, have the best, supposed “backstories.” One of them does so in the most petty and obsessive way after Odokawa inconveniences him. Other characters that did not get as much time to develop take interest in him for seemingly no reason. What makes him likable to me as a viewer doesn’t seem like anybody else in the story would like him voluntarily for who he is, sorry Capoeira girl. Perhaps I’m just as worn out as he is, but most of his interactions with her went over my head. Otherwise, most of the character’s intentions seem to be grounded in reality. I rooted for most of them throughout, because, oh Yaldabaoth, seeing these animals that slowly go insane and in turn make terrible decisions is hilarious. Perhaps Odd Taxi could have expanded upon these characters more. Though, how it could go about this is beyond me, since the pacing was already quite slow as is for an anime that is thirteen episodes. It is a lot easier to juggle three beanbags than five beanbags.I feel like its art doesn’t get as much praise as it should. Odd Taxi does this just as well as its characterization. Again, its choice of making its characters animals was mostly a stylistic choice. The designs are nicely done, and each one is distinguishable from the others. I like Fuyuki’s design the most, his design has an appealing color pallette. Most of the colors in Odd Taxi are more dark and muted which stands in stark contrast with Odd Taxi’s bright character designs, which helps these characters pop out. Much of its background has a texture similar to that of a comic book or smooth sandpaper. Odd Taxi was lacking when it came to its animation, which could have been better. This is especially noticeable with the cars, but everyone's movements itself were a bit janky as well. As a final point, the music was nice, it fit the scenery.Truthfully, Odd Taxi could not be considered a hidden gem anymore, since this anime was really well received ever since its release three years ago. Sure, it is still out of the public eye, but it pretty much did nearly the exact opposite of “fading into obscurity,” it got a spotlight, in the corner. Odd Taxi gives enough to hook people in the first episode, but not enough to the point where it becomes super engaging. Odokawa is an excellent choice for a main character, and the people he encounters vary in likability, which is largely influenced by the amount of screen time they have. Its art ties it altogether which makes it a more chill, standalone mystery/crime thriller for a pretty ordinary setting. Its slow pacing pays off at the final few episodes for those that notice the small details."
Kubo-san wa Mob wo Yurusanai,"Kubo Won’t Let Me Be InvisibleRating: 7/10You know that feeling when someone actually sees you—not just glances at you, but truly notices you for who you are? That’s what Kubo Won’t Let Me Be Invisible captures so beautifully. Watching this show felt like a warm hug, one of those experiences that leave you smiling even during the quietest moments.The story revolves around Junta Shiraishi, the kind of guy who fades into the background so effortlessly that he’s practically a living “Where’s Waldo?” game. And then there’s Nagisa Kubo—bubbly, charming, and just the right amount of mischievous—who decides that she won’t let him disappear into the...shadows anymore.My Experience Watching ItHonestly, I wasn’t expecting much when I started this anime. I figured it’d be another generic rom-com with teasing and cute moments. But what surprised me was how... human it felt. Junta’s invisibility isn’t just a gimmick; it’s a metaphor for how many of us feel at some point—ignored, unnoticed, or like we don’t matter. Watching Kubo go out of her way to make Junta feel seen hit me harder than I thought it would.There’s something so pure about the way Kubo interacts with Junta. Sure, she teases him (a lot), but it’s never mean-spirited. Her playful remarks always come with this undertone of kindness, like she’s trying to pull him out of his comfort zone while still respecting who he is. It reminded me of people in my life who’ve done the same for me—people who’ve nudged me toward growth without ever pushing too hard.What I LovedThe Atmosphere: The pastel colors and soft art style made the entire show feel like a daydream. It’s like stepping into a slice-of-life version of a warm summer afternoon.Relatable Junta: Let’s be honest—most of us have felt like Junta at some point. His struggles to stand out, his insecurities, and his moments of awkward bravery? I could see bits of myself in him.Kubo’s Energy: Kubo isn’t just the typical “quirky girl” trope. She’s full of life but never overshadows Junta. She makes him shine in his own quiet way, and that’s a dynamic I don’t see often enough in romance anime.The Little Moments: This anime thrives on the small things—Kubo waiting for Junta at the school gate, a quick smile, or a shared laugh over something trivial. These moments felt real, like they could happen to anyone, and that’s what made them special.What Didn’t Work for MeBut it wasn’t perfect. After a few episodes, I started noticing a pattern: Kubo teases, Junta blushes, rinse, repeat. It’s cute, but it does get repetitive. And while I loved the main duo, the supporting cast felt like props rather than actual characters. I wish they’d been given more depth because they had so much potential.Also, the romance moves at a glacial pace. Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for a slow burn, but this one felt like it was perpetually stuck in first gear. By the end, I was rooting for something—anything—to shake things up.Why I Gave It a 7/10Kubo Won’t Let Me Be Invisible is the kind of anime you watch when you need something light and comforting. It doesn’t try to be groundbreaking, and that’s okay. It’s like sitting on a park bench with a good friend—no big revelations, just a nice, cozy time.For me, it’s a 7/10 because while it warmed my heart, it didn’t leave a lasting impression. It’s a show I’d recommend to anyone looking for something wholesome, but not one I’d call unforgettable. Still, I’ll always remember the way it made me feel seen, in the same way Kubo made Junta feel seen.Would I Recommend It?Absolutely—if you’re in the mood for something sweet and easy to watch. It’s not a masterpiece, but it doesn’t need to be. Sometimes, all you want is a story that feels like a quiet celebration of being noticed."
"Hazurewaku no ""Joutai Ijou Skill"" de Saikyou ni Natta Ore ga Subete wo Juurin suru made","There is one word that can describe the show: Forced.I’m gonna stop you now, if you want to enjoy the show and just want something to fill your time, go ahead, it can do that. But if you’re looking for a real good show to talk about, this ain’t it. And you can continue to see why.The plot? To put it simply, it’s like playing DnD with a lazy DM once every few months with no notes being taken. It’s a Shield Hero/Arifureta despair to victory style wannabe without the proper build up or effort to want to do so. They show his backstory, a...forced scene to show his and the class’ behavior, him being abandoned, his despair at that, secret power reveal, and his recovery, all within the first episode.Not revealing the actual details of the plot, it has the typical popularizing cliches, not the harem surprisingly, and convenient plot drops, things being perfectly in line to make things simpler. But this pushes it to another degree, setting sudden limitations, that would’ve affected earlier plot, to make the current situation more dire, then forgetting they exist in later similar situations and coming up with another restriction instead. Any minor obstacle is surpassed within the next few minutes without any build up, as if they were just setting it up as a safety net to stifle question. Characters, that seem world changing, are introduced and swiftly rid of, never to be mentioned again, solely to cover up plot holes or to show off the MC’s strength. There’s also sudden romance scenes that come out of nowhere, with the heroine falling obsessively in love with the MC quickly. And man, the author must’ve been horny while writing the first half of this show because people would not stop talking about how much they wanted to have a go and what they would do with the heroine.The MC himself is as consistent as the plot, falling into whatever suits the current situation from a “I fake I’m weak to surprise the enemy”, to “Bring it on b**** I’m stronger than you”, or from a compassionate, caring, good hearted guy, to a “revenge is my only drive” character. They set some of these things up as if he’ll keep up the act, but then seem to forget they did this until later on, where they’ll touch up on it since it’s convenient, then forget about it again.The class is given screen-time, but it’s more of a, this is where they are and what they’re doing, now back to the MC kind of thing, unless it advances the plot for the MC.For the music and art portion, I’m not a good judge, so all I can say is it’s not bad. There’s a lot of cgi for anything more complex than moving just the upper body. And a lot of repeating frames, with some looking awkward being looped. Some scenes don’t make sense, possibly due to plot changes. Music jumps around a bit, but isn’t over excessive and used appropriately. Otherwise it’s your average dark themed anime style.Overall, I’d say it’s a mediocre show. Good enough to fill time, not good enough to recommend. Thought they almost recovered at the end until a forced edge-lord romance scene was placed in. I would watch a second season, but I’d rather the studio spent the effort on another more worthwhile show."
Dungeon Meshi,"I haven't watched anime for a long time and I'm back, one of the anime I watched is this.I saw the title so unique, I tried to watch it, I've finished watching it,In my opinionThe impression of the first episode is a good story, funny, dungeons, monsters, unique food, main characters who are not boring, and a relaxed fantasy story then I want to continue watching it.And I watched it until the last episode.From all the episodes, the four main characters have their own characteristics so that the story complements each other. I usually watch in Japanese but this time I also tried watching in...English and finished watching it and the voice actors are very good.Other characters in the story such as falin, izutsumi, other party and even the orc character make the story develop and good.The animation of each episode is very good such as when fighting monsters, resting, preparing to cook, dialogue when preparing to cook, it's fun to watch and often funny.The battle against monsters is very good from the preparation, before the battle, during the battle, after the battle.Thistle ""The Mad Sorcerer""  in this story is not boring either.Music (OST) is very pleasant to listen to according to the theme of the story every time I hear it I am reminded of the anime title.  OP/ED is good too.Overall, this fantasy anime very good to watch. recomended :)"
Turn A Gundam,"6.5/10 ~ Peak Gundam with some major flawsThis Gundam is truly Peak Gundam in terms of the story they are trying to tell, Animation, design, art direction and some character writing. And Making all Gundam Timelines diverge into this is something I can get behind. The fact that there are actual scenes of Industrial Age vs Space Age/ Mobile Suites and everything in between is wild, and you generally don't know what will actually happen which is a huge plus.I am a bit torn by this rating, I really really enjoyed this one... but my god was most of the viewing exsperiance for me jankey....- Only available in Sub- extremely hard to find online anywhere legally and you have to purchase expensive DVD's or Bluerays- streams of this are hard to find- no reliable torrents are available- horrible pacing- bad ending- main character is flat and bland, but kinda cute lmfao- almost every romance just happens and makes no sense- what show/time line is Corrin from, this will haunt me- I still dont understand the inclusion of the turn x, atleast they said the name was dumb in the show lol- BBEG is just a guy... why does every Gundam end in a sword fight out of mech lolThat being said this has to be the worst Gundam as far as Pacing, things just happen left and write for no explanation, The very beginning and end truly suffer from this. The ending which is about the last 2-3 episodes has a season worth of content of event that happen. The final battle just kinda ends with no real explanation, and the final sequence of where all the charecters end up are just random scenes, many of which don't feel like they really belong to anything in particular. This one really could have used a better story board director, I would assume that they ran out of time at the end or planned poorly to fit the story into a neat 50 box, which is crazy when you realize there are recap episodes in there as well.Unlike other Gundam Series that preach over and over again that kids shouldn't go to war, and morality. But rather how idiotic the government, Military and low key men can be. Especially when the military thinks it knows best, how that can be ironic and hypocritical to their motives and actions, and how power can corrupt.Like Every other Gundam series that was smooshed down into a recap movie series, I couldn't imagine this or any of the others a good watch especially for a first time, so I would skip those and just commit to the whole series.I left this one as one of the last Gundam's to watch as I thought I would want to understand all the foreseeable references to the past series I knew this was chockfull of. Past all the Zakus and the fact there is a ZZ Mobile suite, in the form of the Kapool (AMX-109 Capule), and some random flash back scenes that honestly do not impact a single thing in the story if you do not understand them... nothing here is even really that enhanced other then that you know that the Kapool should be pained Blue lolSo dont feel like you have to watch 100's of hours of Gundam to watch this... hell this one is so stand alone it could be the only Gundam you ever watch."
Another World,"JUST A QUICK ADVICEWATCH THIS BEFORE THE MOVIEThe order you watch both this OVA and Movie will change your perspective on the Main Character.I am so glad that I listend to a random youtuber's advice to watch the OVA before the movie and it might've been the wrong intentions of the author but you will understand everything about the movie more clearly without massive spoilers and because the movie will be a great end to this watch order because of the good ending while if you watch this OVA last, you will only see his depressing struggles with no reward.Depending on which order you watch...first, you will side to either the younger or the older MC, since this OVA focuses on the older MC you will understand his actions more and how much he has gone through, but if you watch the movie first, you will side with the younger MC and only see the older MC as just a villian which is absolutely misplaced anger.FINAL CONVINCING :Its only 3 episodes 20 minutes each and even available on Youtube.I hope im not too late and you already watched the movie, but if you ever decided to rewatch the movie, follow this amazing order."
Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru.,"Upon rewatching this for the first time since probably 2019, I’m proud to say it holds up as well as expected. Being a few years wiser and well removed from high school at this point, this definitely doesn’t hit as hard as it used to and seems much more angsty than I remembered. But… Hachiman and the show are intentionally written that way. It’s a coming of age story after all and from the perspective of a doomer teenager who still has a lot to learn.So what we get over the course of the season is him gradually coming out of his shell and...learning to become a more sociable person, even if he still remains quite stuck in his ways. Snafu isn’t much of a romance show in this first season, but mostly a comedy slice of life. Which is perfectly fine. It’s slow paced, but deliberately lined up to have bigger things happen later on.What we establish here is the main cast of characters and their quirks. There are definitely lesser characters who are stereotypes and not with much depth.For example, we get a token Chūnibyō and a Fujoshi, who are effective comic relief but not necessary at all. The core characters are very good though. Both romance leads, Yuki and Yui are very likable and have surprising layers to them in this first season. Their optimist and pragmatic outlooks serve for a very interesting contrast and both have great chemistry with Hachiman.He’s a refreshing protagonist because he’s relatable and highly flawed. He’s also not a blithering idiot or a doormat like most Harem MCs. I do have some minor criticisms of the first season, but frankly they’re not worth mentioning. Great first season.I’m looking forward to seeing the secondary cast fleshed out and actual romance."
"Bye Bye, Earth","A confusing, and wild ride. Bye Bye World is an anime filled with wonderful art, a great soundtrack, unique and interesting power systems, excellent world building, great characters, emotion, and a fascinating story. All things that would make it a masterclass anime, yet it has one grand flaw. The story is confusing and completely unexplained.The overall design of the show is wonderful from the character appearances, personalities, world design, art style, color schemes used, music, and voice acting. The characters are very detailed and look amazing, their swords and weapons, which serve as an extension of the characters, show just as much detail as...the main characters. The sounds of the show be it the ambient sounds of the environment, the music played or sung, and the voice acting is splendid. The soundtrack is excellent.The power system within the show is relatively unique incorporating music and marching band formation into it. This system does not only include combat as singing is used mainly to create, repair, or control things within the world. The combat system also incorporates swordsmanship and magic. The swordsmanship is relatively realistic with more choreographed stances and fighting rather than random swinging. The combat includes excellent swordplay and visually appealing magic.The character development and romance are ehh. Most of the development is, much like the story, not progressed too much and that which is isn’t explained all that well. It is hard not to grow attached to the many characters within the show. Most characters and character stories at the end of the story so far are bitter or gloomy so don’t expect a happy ending yet.If you can overlook a somewhat confusing and completely unanswered story, then this show will not disappoint. I cannot recommend this show entirely since many will be turned off by the confusing and non-explained story. If you are fine with that idea and just want to watch a good anime, then this one is a great choice. Although the main downside of this show is the confusing story, season 2 has already been confirmed so maybe things will make more sense then!"
MF Ghost 2nd Season,"It could always be worse... That's Excatly what MF Ghost season 2 is.... WORSEIf you want more Initial D then watch Miami Guns Episode 4 which is a whole ass Parody of Initial D, with CGI cars rendered in the exact same way as Initial D season 2 and this was made in the year 2000 and its more faithful hella funny and a really good throwback to Initial D, MF Ghost IS NOT.Season one was bad but somehow it went over a lot of peoples heads. This season is more like the later seasons of original Initial D where cars start teleporting and doing...wacky shit and Takumi's character development stopped.  Then again the MC of MF Ghost never had character development he's already perfect. This is just more lame incredibly long drawn out circuit racing with way too much non-character development injected into each episode.Like I said before watch Miami Guns Episode 4 if you what some funny as hell Initial D Parody action, don't watch MF Ghost season 1 or 2"
Fumetsu no Anata e,"This anime is probably the biggest fall-off I have ever seen.The first few episodes were genuinely some of the most interesting beginnings of a show. The concept and story was very unique and fantastic to watch. An honest 10/10 show from the get-go. Then it fell off. Fell off hard. It managed to go from a 10/10 to a low 6/10 by the end. The story branched off into weird stuff and no longer had what made it so good. It became a boring show with predictable scenes, eye-rolling annoying characters, and bad/lame stories.Highly disappointing show and very frustrating to see what could've been a...masterpiece fall off so hard.I would not recommend wasting your time watching this show except for the first few episodes."
One Piece: Gyojin Tou-hen,"Absolute ass! As one may know perfection is not in human nature, however human could come as close as 97percent of perfection. By having experience, knowledge, imagination, creativity and critical thinking.To think they could fumble hard on such a simple work was not on my radar. From not being able to give a proper flow, to cutting important manga panel ( they cut my beloved Hancock panels (*sob, sob).AnimationThe first episode was good in term of animation. But afterward it got below average for some reason. Maybe they are saving for later episodes (fighting episodes?) Which is better than nothing, I...guess.Even though toei has been letting down one piece from the start. Yes from the start. If it weren't for them one piece could have been so much popular, however it may be the time, finally for one piece to go seasonal, Finally. Tears in my eyes of happiness. (The good thing that came out of this).Should you watch it?Absolutely! It's new one piece content baby. The opening and ending are new and good. Can't I use emoji here?"
Kimetsu no Yaiba: Hashira Geiko-hen,"very meh arcWhile the training arc is kind of cool and there are good moments all throughout, all in all, its kind of boring. The last episode does get you hyped for the next arc though, but that's kind of the problem in itself, the next arc doesn't come out for some time.So this arc: while probably great in the grand scheme of the story, was overall, kind of like a giant beach episode where nothing really happens, except the setup for the next arc.Great animation still and tanjiro is still the goodest of boys, and it does do some character development here and there,...not a bad arc but there was nothing of significance that happens until the last episode."
Kami no Tou: Koubou-sen,"Maybe I didn't notice how bad season 2 first cour was because I saw a review saying the exact opposite BUT, I loved that, nothing rubbed me off the wrong way or weirded me out. Meanwhile this after the second episode was almost unwatchable. All episodes were slideshows of faces just spouting their lines and somehow they managed to even have the fighting scenes play out that way, characters very often become doodles and lose their quality and the dialogue is so rough I'm getting physical pain from trying to convince myself it's not as bad. I absolutely loved s2c1 and like how the story...progresses here but it's adapted and animated in such. a. bad. way. it's ridiculous. And that is very specifically after the battle to board Archimedes concluded, up until then I'd noticed nothing."
Skip to Loafer,"Skip and Loafer shows that you can excel with just the basics. The characters act like human beings. Words that end with -dere are abandoned in favor of writing actually good characters. Each character has their own colorful and interesting personality and they interact like real human beings would. The characters also stay true to their personality and act accordingly. It is great that a writer finally got rid of the stupid one-trait characters that only do one thing.There is no crazy premise or story with time-travel or whatnot. The setting is just a normal high school setting. Life is chill and there are no...crazy stakes like death, poverty or world ending disaster. There is just the normal high school drama and their usual social interactions like friendship, conflict, school and events.However, Skip and Loafer skillfully makes this interesting to watch. You see the effort characters expend to connect with each other. There is sometimes friction due to misunderstandings, jealousy or malice. Other times, friendships grow due to positive experiences between people. There are no deadly stakes, but there are stakes which matter and are relatable. People aren't instantly friends but their relationships develop based on their experiences.The main characters and their interactions specifically sell the show for me. This is not a story of boy meets girl and instantly they fall in love. In fact, the romance aspect is sparse here. Sousuke himself is very socially adept and knows how to deal with others. However, he is cryptic and hides his true thoughts. Of course, you can infer how he feels a lot of the time due to his behavior and tone, but he will always politely smile and try to hide his true self. He becomes friends with his opposite, Mitsumi. She is transparent, headfirst and a little socially awkward. She interacts with people in good faith and speaks her mind.My personal analysis is that Sousuke becomes friends with Mitsumi because he feels comfortable speaking with someone who has no ulterior motives. Mitsumi becomes friends with Sousuke because she enjoys their time together and she learns more about social norms through him. It is a very interesting dynamic and it makes perfect sense why they would be friends.Sousuke's cryptic personality drives the story forward due to the viewer's knowledge that he is hiding something, especially when he deflects some questions. On the other hand, Mitsumi drives the plot forward in a ""hero's journey"" kind of way. The viewer knows her goals and you watch her try to achieve them. In a sense, Sousuke is the ""mystery"" aspect of the show and Mitsumi is the ""straightforward journey""The show relies on ""show don't tell"". Sousuke doesn't say ""My polite smile hides what I truly think."" You see it through the changes in his voice, how he talks, how he behaves, how talkative he is, etc. In fact, it is impressive how they took a character who is supposed to be cryptic and they made him subtly change his behavior based on what he is feeling. The rest of the cast operates in a similar way. Sometimes you can infer their motivations just by how they phrase their sentences or how they act.There is nothing crazy but the creators have made a great show. I hope there are more seasons. I gave this 8/10 in my personal list purely because I had to rate it lower than certain other shows and movies, but it easily deserves a 9. This is my favorite anime romcom."
Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou Season 3,"Arifureta is an anime known to many as isekai harem trash, and if not so much any more, it definitely was known for that when season 1 came out, but comparing this to the similar kind of isekai shows with an overpowered MC and a bunch of girls fawning over him that have come out in the past few years, this hits different. This is proven by the very fact that it has received a 3rd season, something a generic isekai could never do. I hope.A lot of these kinds of shows suffer from either bad character writing or weird pacing, and sometimes both of...those put together with eerie animation on top of it. By bad character writing I mostly mean MC's going through something similar that Hajime went through, some kind of betrayal or bullying, and then they still somehow have the highest principles of morality and somehow end up forgiving everybody, basically they are painted as the most forgiving, nice and kind characters and do things humans would never do in their situation.This show thankfully doesn't suffer from that, even in season 3. It knows what it is and who's the audience. Hajime went through bad betrayal, almost lost his life, and that is reflected on how he acts going forward. He values people who he cares about or is close to and doesn't give a damn about anybody else. In addition he doesn't act all edgy and ''above everybody'' for no reason, he knows he's strong because he has defeated labyrinths.The same goes for the girls around him, they are not there for a nonsensical reason, almost all of them are around him with a good explainable reason. Almost, because Kaori liking him was kind of like in any other isekai. But then again, it's not like Hajime has an uncontrolled ego, he always prioritizes Yue and tries to keep it that way, he doesn't go for every girl just because he has a chance to, Hajime has set in stone values, and that is reflected even in season 3.In terms of pacing, Arifureta definitely feels about average or maybe even a bit more fast-paced, which is definitely better than most of the isekai anime nowadays, that set out some random goal, and in the end nothing happens and you feel like the story didn't progress at all, or they skip over half the plot and leave the watcher with only questions, but it is already season 3 after all, so maybe the pacing is right and I just don't want this show to end, either or. Arifureta's story feels meaningful, actual progress gets made, and new powers discovered, although this show definitely deserves a few episodes for deeper worldbuilding, especially since it's already the 3rd season and the people who didn't enjoy the show have already left. As it seems by the pacing though, most likely not all volumes will be adapted into season 3, meaning we might just get a 4th season.Altogether, season 3 is the continuation of the story and it seems to keep getting better. The Haulia tribe arc was great, and as it's only at episode 6 at the time of writing, one can only hope that the ending of this season doesn't miss.TL;DRThe show doesn't deserve the bad rep it seems to get, as it's character writing and worldbuilding are miles above most other similar isekai. Season 3 is great and for anybody who enjoyed the first 2 seasons, this is a treat."
Plastic Memories,"Plastic Memories tries to tell a very serious story in the dumbest way possible, through very anime-esque tropes. Isla is the shy girl, Tsukasa is the very safely played dense protagonist who is polite and gets embarrassed, Michiru is the tsundere, so on and so forth. This usually isn't a problem when you're writing a trashy harem just to sell its porn afterwards. However, it is a problem when you want me to take the story as a very serious drama.The show TRIES to tug on your heartstrings, but it's not possible to get attached to very cliche tropes. When you want me to be...invested in a character, I have to see meaningful interactions and their relationship build up. I won't feel involved just because you slapped the main character tag on them and spent 90% of the screen time showing Isla being shy. I can't take the show as seriously as they want me to, especially when all Isla does is ""uwu"" and all Michiru does is ""b-b-baka"". The show has to make the characters feel like they matter. It has to show them do stuff, have dialogue, have experiences. It doesn't do much of that.The two main characters are possibly the worst combo for a viewer experience. A shy girl and a polite, safe protagonist. Two character archetypes that avoid anything happening. Consequently, the romance is them being embarrassed on screen and not doing anything meaningful. I don't recall any meaningful conversations. There's one backstory that they tease the entire show for Isla. That backstory is so mediocre that once you reach its conclusion all you could think is ""That's it? That's the crazy story I've been waiting for?""It also feels like Tsukasa doesn't really feel any stakes. If you told Tsukasa you planted a bomb under his bed that will detonate in 3 days, he will spend 2 days doing his business as usual and then at the last 3 minutes he will panick that a bomb will blow up his bed. Tsukasa somehow feels less invested in his own life than the viewer.For a romance show, I really did not feel like there was much romance. I can't remember any meaningful interaction between Tsukasa and Isla. Nothing moves their relationship forward. They don't try to move it forward. It feels like even after months of dating, they are still distant coworkers. Isla just goes ""uwu Im shy"" and Tsukasa says ""haha ok I am polite and passive and will do nothing."" After 13 episodes, it feels like not much has happened."
Nageki no Bourei wa Intai shitai,"Light version of My Eminence in shadow, basically the same tropes of MC leading an organization, with that incidental facade of acting very smart and strategic, when in actuality everything just happens to end up well, as ""planned"", because of either luck, or everyone else who's actually smarter/the real brains of the operation assuming control and working on some implied grand strategy in place by the MC, and making it all work accordingly.Tho, in every aspect this series feels as of lower quality compared to Eminence in Shadow, from character development, world building, through pacing and the structure of each episode itself. Even while having...some points of its own, it feels rushed, not giving the proper amount of time to build up scenes, plots and conflicts, and just either skipping or rushing important things, making it all fell off as lacking in impact.This will be one of those shows who tries too much to be like something else and fails at being its own thing. Passable mid, but completely forgettable."
Hundred,"Note to self:Contains good character designs. Good fan service, mostly through the costumes.Characters don't get a lot of room to grow, because there is only one season. It feels like they could have made more seasons with season one as a good starter. No real cliffhangers or impetus to continue though, aside from more fun with the crew and the occasional jiggle service.The cast is likable enough, but doesn't rise much above their stereotypes.The short of it:Jiggles with guns on a boat!Watch again? No need to see the show again, but was nice to see at least once."
Look Back,"""Look Back,"" a poignant short film based on Tatsuki Fujimoto's story, is a stirring exploration of artistic ambition, friendship, and the ever-present question of why we have the passion to create. Fujimoto, renowned for the visceral energy of Chainsaw Man, shifts gears here to deliver a deeply personal narrative that feels intimate and universal all at once.The story follows Fujino Ayumu, a young aspiring mangaka whose life revolves around the obsessive pursuit of her craft. Fujino pours her heart into creating manga strips for the school paper, basking in the admiration of her classmates and teachers. Her world, however, is upended when another student, Kyoumoto,...quietly enters the scene. Kyoumoto, a reclusive genius with a stunning artistic flair, is granted one of Fujino’s coveted manga slots in the paper. The mere existence of Kyoumoto ignites a spark of envy and determination in Fujino, driving her to hone her skills with relentless dedication.This rivalry transforms into a tender friendship when Fujino, tasked with delivering Kyoumoto's graduation certificate, ventures into Kyoumoto’s world. Their meeting is a turning point, as the two bond over their shared love of storytelling and commit to working together. The film’s portrayal of their collaboration is a joy to behold, with heartfelt montages that celebrate the growth of their artistry and their evolving camaraderie. The animation here is a marvel—not flashy, but meticulously hand-crafted, with an understated beauty that mirrors the simplicity and purity of the characters' journey.To delve further into the plot would spoil the emotional weight of the story’s latter half, but suffice it to say, life’s inevitable shifts take their toll. Kyoumoto chooses to pursue art college, while Fujino presses forward with her manga series. What follows is a meditation on perseverance, loss, and the enduring power of creation, even in the face of life’s uncertainties.""Look Back"" isn’t just a coming-of-age tale; it’s a reflection on the artistic spirit. Fujimoto dares to ask the open-ended question: why do we create? The film’s answer is as layered as it is profound. Whether it’s for connection, expression, or the simple joy of making something that didn’t exist before, ""Look Back"" reminds us of the transformative power of art and friendship.It’s rare to find a film that can elicit shock, wonder, and quiet introspection in equal measure. Look Back is one of those rare gems—a simple yet brilliant ode to the beauty of creation and the bonds we form along the way."
Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu Gaiden,"Still extremely unnecessary, and until the latter half, doesn’t really add much to the lore and character depth of Legend of the Galactic Heroes, but it’s still great to spend more time with these characters and see even a little more of the series’ fabulous worldbuilding. The main appeal is definitely the focus on the Rosen Ritter regiment, of which it does a lot to explain the purpose and evolution. If there’s any weaknesses, it’s that the first three arcs are largely uninteresting and serve mainly to demonstrate Reinhard’s ascension through the ranks, but eventually this prequel finds its feet, and though I’m still adjusting...to Yang’s new voice actor, it’s great to see him back!"
Kidou Senshi Gundam: Cucuruz Doan no Shima,"Unbelievably fun. Beautiful animation, beautiful robots. Wish I got to see the white base more but I get why they weren’t in it as much. Marcos was good but I wish Cara his character instead. The music was really good too. Sleggar was a lot better here, and Bright’s character improved tenfold with the more expressive animation. Villain team was meh but the island residents made up for it. Fraw Bow was also really good despite having like six lines the whole movie. Kai Shiden and Hayato Kobayashi, mayors of losertown, got their asses beat by a goat. I wish the secondary pilots didn’t get...the floor mopped with them, and that the fight scenes were longer in general, but that’s not a huge deal IG."
Hametsu no Oukoku,"This is hours of my life that I'm not getting back. I know its my fault (I have to finish a show once I start unless its too many miles long to manage.) The Kingdoms of Ruin is by far one of the WORST anime I have ever seen.To begin with, aside from one person in the entire story, EVERYONE is trash. Main guy: genocidal angst monster who wants vengeance because shitty people did shitty things. While I sympathize with his reasons, wanting to kill everyone is an extreme overreaction. Main girl: dumb bubblegum simp. Main guy literally threatens to kill her at least...once an episode and she still follows him like a little lost puppy. Her back story that could have been interesting is just washed under the rug. Everyone hates me because of my powers? Oh well, let me just spend all of my existence screaming the main guys name and stalking him. Villain: so overly attached to her boyfriend that she'd go to another world and ruin it just to get him back. Women whose sole motivation is the man in their lives seldom make actually good villains. Side characters: Literally just bad people with bad motivations. One character in this story is actually decent, and she gets horrifically murdered in the first episode.Then we get to the story: boy wants revenge for the murder of his mentor. Okay, we've done that before successfully in other properties. Though the boy who wants revenge doesn't usually want to kill everyone indiscriminately.... Honestly the show feels more like how much blood can we spill JUST because we can. There is an episode where people are standing in blood up to their calves. Its violence just for the sake of being violent, which I guess if that's your thing, then this is the show for you.Overall, I will give ONE episode some actual value, but even that episode is kind of uncomfortable. One episode acknowledges the hubris of man and technology with sex robots. That is the ONLY episode in the show that might be worth something for having a decent message to it. But it feels so detached from the rest of the show that I can't even use it to boost this from anything other than a 1 Rating.There are thousands of other anime out there. Please don't waste your time on this one."
Spy x Family,"The hardest mission of them all, is raising a family.Like a Pierre-Melville French noir film with an explosive jazzy atmosphere, filled to the brim with Cold War-esque counterintelligence shenanigans that is, half the time laughably ridiculous in a self-aware sense, and half the time pure entertainment galore. Pack this all together with the amazing production from CloverWorks and Wit Studio, you got yourself Spy x Family.I can see why this won Anime of the Year. The first four episodes are fiery, setting up the story, arguably perfectly. There is so much to praise. I stopped watching a while back only a couple episodes...in, yet re-watching them was even better than before. Not to mention the absolute units of an opening and ending this show has. They should be studied for how well they represent the show, without even being noticeable.The premise of the story itself is absolutely insane, so I couldn't wrap my head around the comedic aspect of it all. But, it works. They have flipped the whole premise into poking fun at the insanity of everything. A spy is married to an assassin, with a daughter who is a psychic. The daughter knows everything about them, since she can read their minds. It's a perfect setup.Yet, Spy x Family is an anime that lacks any subtly. I mean, this is a show that repeats this same premise to you, even if it is the season finale. I don't know how many times I need to be told the situation they are in before this show realizes I understand. There are many opportunities to make use of the whole psychic child aspect, yet they kind of just don't. It's often just used for cheap jokes that sometimes stick. It's one of the weaker parts of the show, and it is done a whole bunch.As the story continues, it loses steam. And I mean it when I say the show slowed down dramatically from the fast paced brilliance of the start. Not saying the story turns straight off a cliff, but it goes for the more scenic route. A route with a lot more possibilities to lose interest. They have the foundation laid out, yet there wasn't really much of a conclusion to the first part. Seems they really wanted to release both parts together in one, but that never came around.I wouldn't be quick to drop this, especially if you are thinking the story might not be worth it. There are parts in this that are actually great. Largely, the whole family dynamic is very well put together, illustrating what it truly means to be family very clearly. They are a fake family, yet it's coming into question more and more whether that is truly the case, especially as each character starts warming up to each other. I'm just stuck wondering, what is coming next? How will this end?Give this a watch, chances are you will enjoy it. It's a very unique show with a very fresh spin on family life."
Yoasobi Gurashi!,"A solid story, overall a very feel-good, sweet hentai! The character's character development was the best part of this hentai actually, despite the genre, normally people would focus more on the horny parts lol. The satifaction on the sex scenes weren't the best, the animations were lacking even though the art was splendid and beautiful. Still, it wasn't a big deal since they looked like they were enjoying and deeply in love with each other, I could felt it through the screen! The body parts are well drawn for a uncensored hentai lol. It has a very sweet story between the two mc's, the girl...who is a famous model, the guy who gave up on his dreams of becoming a photographer. The concept was simple but the details weren't left behind too! Pacing was great, though it's a short 7-8 mins per episode but it has does it's job. The only part I disliked was the random side character that barge in and had an ""affair"" with the guy. Despite that, this hentai deserves a try for sure! I have been coming back to it ever since I had watched it for the first time haha."
Look Back,"A perfect distillation of everything Fujimoto is as a person and as an author. Lines are drawn not only on paper, but between people as well. A relationship born from a shared passion for a craft ends up being even deeper than you ever thought it could get. Love for art, that translates into love for people, but also loss, grief and needing to move on.But was it truly the craft that I had passion for, or was it for you? Would I had loved my time as much as I did if you weren't there with me?And what will I do when you are...not here anymore?One of the greats when it comes to coming of age stories. Doesn't pull any punches and I had to wait a long while before being able to write anything about it. If that doesn't tell you enough about Tatsuki Fujimoto, I don't know what does."
School Days,"School Days is my guilty pleasure. School Days is 100 times better than Love Is Blind or Love Island or whatever trashy reality stuff I occasionally find myself in the mood to watch.First time I watched it was in 2007, when I was in high school. I rated it like a 5. (My taste for satire and stupid levels of drama hadn't quite developed ;))Now, 18 years later, I felt randomly inspired to rewatch, because it is just one of those anime that stuck with me throughout all those years.(How could it not?)Needless to say, I loved every second of my rewatch.I'm actually...incredibly sad that the series flopped and is looked at as such a joke, because I unironically think this is a masterpiece. A trashy masterpiece, but a masterpiece nonetheless.Give me more ridiculous, over-the-top drama anime like this, I'm begging you, anime gods.I WANT my characters to be stupid and selfish and evil and unlikeable, because THAT is entertaining.Not to sound like a snob, but half the anime I start nowadays seem like they have next to no conflict going on and there is literally no reason for me to continue watching.By the end of the first episode, School Days delivers a reason to want to watch to the VERY END. No questions asked.(The soundtrack is also pretty good.)"
Giji Harem,"I really fail to understand who would genuinely find a show like this funny enough for it to warrant a ""comedy"" tag. Toddlers maybe? I just don't understand the appeal behind anime characters making silly faces and them overreacting to the most mundane situations imaginable. The anime feels lifeless. It's fine for an anime to focus exclusively on two characters, but if the dialogue between said characters is dull and uninspired then the anime very quickly becomes a ""nothing"" show.I do historically really enjoy romcom anime, so I did have somewhat high hopes for this one. A girl who can act out several characters...and swap between them rapidly in the middle of a conversation is a very interesting plot device in theory, but the application is underwhelming. At least it had a functional romance, which is more than can be said for most other anime I've seen.I'm not a big fan."
Mitsuboshi Colors,"Mitsuboshi Colors is a little heartwarming anime that follows the daily antics of the self-styled ""Colors"", a group of elementary school-girls who defend the city of Ueno of all and one evil who may rear its ugly head from across the horizon (well, not really, if you think about it, but that would be a topic for another time).The first thing it came to my mind once I got to watch this series is just how similar it seemed to the many children's cartoons of the 90s and 2000s I grew up with during the first decade or so of the New Millennium (think ""Arthur""...and such, for example). Both follow a cast of first or second level-school children in their daily antics and little ""adventures"" in a somewhat natural setting, as a considerable amount of the series takes place in a park, actually.This anime does not contend with a high amount of characters, it is rather limited in the amount of information it decides to throw at the spectator's face. Contrary to this being a negative, it makes the story easy to follow and quick to swallow, as the series compensates for the lack of characters with personality. Every single one of this show's characters has an unique gimmick going on with them: from the cheery and energetic (albeit a bit vulgar sometimes) Sat-Chan to the fatherly and rather eccentric in more than one single way ""Oyaji"". It never gets boring, let me guarantee you that.The characters and backrounds are polished and well designed, as the overall BGM is. The show's creators really took their time to make this world feel as alive and immersive as possible, as most of the backround images are actually photos of real places with an anime style drawn upon them. Making them delightful to look at in most ocations. My only gripe with the overall design of this anime would be with the intro, which seems kinda boring and uninspired, in my opinion. The intro is the first (or one of the first) things a viewer sees once he clicks on an episode, and helps to set the mood and to some extent, the identity and feel of the show going forward. So the cold and generic melody I encountered once starting watching the series took me off of what otherwise is the warm and charming world of three little kids utilizing their imagination to live their lives to the fullest extend possible.My final toughs on this anime: if you enjoyed (or still enjoy) those aforementioned children's cartoons from the second paragraph you would probably enjoy Mitsuboshi Colors. If you enjoy little heartwarming comedies with an easy to follow story and memorable cast then I would also give it a shot, because the enjoyment you will get out of this show will leave you thinking about it for times to come."
Kidou Senshi Gundam: Suisei no Majo Season 2,"The show is a lot of fun, and overall I enjoyed my time with it, but the writing has issues. The pacing is just downright bad and every plot line suffers for it. The show has so many plot lines crammed into it, and not only does it not have enough time to properly go through and resolve them all, it doesn't use the time it does have efficiently. It also keeps ramming new discoveries and new issues all the way down to the last episode.The political intrigue balloons in scope and starts meandering. A bit over halfway through Season 2, so many things...start happening at once it would already be hard to follow if the writing held up to begin with. A lot of WfM's plot developments don't have a lot of logic behind them, but Season 2 has the worst of it - things just start happening with no explanation, plot twists come out of nowhere and are handwaved away (a LOT of things get handwaved away), things just... happen, with no real reason behind them. Beyond being hard to follow, it becomes hard to care about.The main duo's relationship suffers the most from this - unlike in Season 1 where the politics, the overarching story, and the character drama between our main two were nicely intertwined, in Season 2, for the most part, these plot threads are now separate. The main duo have no time to breathe, and their story has no time to develop. It doesn't feel like a conscious decision by the writers, but rather a consequence of a lack of runtime.The show is still gorgeous, the characters are still fun, the ending, while feeling rushed and generally unsatisfying, still has a lot to love. Many plot lines go nowhere, many of those that do get resolved don't get resolved well, it becomes hard to follow and can generally feel like a bloated, meandering mess at times. Still - while I can't outright recommend it, I had a lot of fun with the series.As an aside, it was great to see some yuri in a mainstream franchise like this. While it ended up being a minor element in the grand scheme of things, I hope WfM is successful enough to bring more yuri to genres we don't see much of it in. Failing that, I hope it's at least successful enough to make bigoted corpo suits think twice before trying to walk back on yuri developments in shows."
Sword Art Online,"This is a perfect shonen anime although probably a little too titillating for such an audience. It's no masterpiece but it is very good. The characters do not really grow, the battles are kind of similar (still very good though) but that really doesn't detract from the beautiful scenery, lovely orchestral music, overwhelming odds and overall perfect teenage angst throughout. I feel jealous of teenagers after watching this. This is an absolute love circle of an anime. Who's he going to pick? We all know who but that doesn't stop everyone from wanting a slice. I'm whole-heartedly  jealous of the protagonist. He's super cool,...perfectly aloof, extremely talented, well drawn and gives out just the right amount of thread for his lovers to pull at so that everyone gets sucked into his constant gloom. I repeat this anime is very good but probably only for young men or women who wouldn't mind the prospect of being a harem girl (I think all of them wouldn't mind being the protagonist's harem girl). I would never recommend or speak of this anime to anyone in real life but I still enjoyed it. Don't watch it."
Tong Ling Fei,"Honestly I didn't like the first few episodes. It felt like watching the same thing again and again, the FL getting in trouble and somehow getting over it. I wasn't really excited for the couple, if anything I was more interested in her relationship with her family. I felt the story didnt started actually moving forward until like half way through the series.I was about to drop it but some of the plot points were interesting and even tho they weren't develope properly, I was able to power through them and finish it.As a positive, the art style is cute and tells you...a lot about each character.I just wish they could have done better on the first eposides and move forward with the story."
Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen - Soukoku-tan,"Alright, so let me start by saying this: I’ve been a Bleach fan for a long time, and even watching it from the lens of 2024, I can still appreciate what made it stand out in the past. Ichigo, in the early days, was this bold, confident character who was better than everyone else. He wasn’t some brooding, self-deprecating protagonist—you know, the usual “I’m different from others but don’t fit in” shtick. No, Ichigo was someone who straight-up didn’t care about being hated for his orange hair or his strength. He was that guy—stronger than everyone around him, unbothered by it. The characters, the power...system, the fights—they all felt fresh, creative, and emotionally impactful. Bleach felt like a breath of fresh air in the shonen world.Now, fast forward to Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War - Part 3, and what the hell happened? This season is so mid, I don’t even know where to begin. It’s as generic as it gets. There’s nothing here that stands out. The villains have zero layers. They’re basically just there to exist. No depth, no personality, no real motivations—they’re just bad guys for the sake of being bad. It’s a bunch of “who’s stronger than who” fights, and it’s all just physical battle after physical battle. The philosophical or ideological conflict that made Bleach interesting in the past? Gone. It’s just one big slugfest where the most powerful one wins. That’s it.Let’s talk about the main antagonist for a second. This guy’s goal is to destroy all three worlds and create a new one where death doesn’t exist. Fine, whatever. But then, when he absorbs the Soul King’s power—basically becoming almighty and omnipotent in the Bleach universe—what does he do? Does he go and obliterate the Soul Reapers who are coming for him? Nah, he just chills in his new royal castle, sitting on his throne, doing absolutely nothing. It’s like the writers didn’t even try to make this villain interesting. He’s just sitting there waiting to be attacked. And when the Soul Reapers finally come to attack, he doesn’t lift a finger. Instead, he sends his minions to do the dirty work. What’s the result? A group battle with random minions, and after some predictable back-and-forth fights, the heroes win. That’s it.I mean, seriously, where’s the creativity here? There’s no substance, no emotional stakes, no complex battles of ideals—just a bunch of guys punching each other to see who’s stronger. Bleach was once something special, but this? This is just another shonen series following the most played-out, generic formula. If you’re hoping for something fresh or exciting, you’ll be sorely disappointed. It’s honestly disappointing to see a series with so much potential fall into such a lazy pattern.And while we’re at it, can we talk about Orihime? What the hell is going on with her character design? Her boobs get bigger every single time she’s on screen. It’s like the animators had a meeting where someone said, “You know what would elevate this scene? More cleavage.” Why? For what purpose? This over-fetishization is completely unnecessary and honestly just embarrassing. She’s walking, she’s talking, and somehow it feels like the entire focus is on her chest rather than anything she’s actually saying or doing.And it sucks, because I used to like her. Orihime was once a loving, caring character with genuine charm. Now, she’s been reduced to the most wasted, one-dimensional character in the series. And let’s throw Chad in there too, because what even is Chad’s role anymore? They’ve both been sidelined to the point of irrelevance. Oihime’s there for fanservice—plain and simple. Chad? He’s just there because Ichigo needs a token friend who doesn’t even participate in meaningful battles anymore.But back to Orihime: what even is her outfit? Everyone else gets armor or a uniform that makes sense for their abilities or fighting style. But her dress? It’s practically designed to show off her cleavage for no reason other than, what, fanservice? From a logical point of view, it makes no sense. From a storytelling point of view, it’s trash. And as a viewer, it’s just plain cringy.These characters deserve better. Orihime and Chad used to have depth. Now? They’re background props, and in Oihime’s case, a walking, talking excuse for unnecessary fanservice. It’s frustrating to watch, and it only highlights how much this series has lost its way.So yeah, that’s my take. Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War - Part 3 is mid, pure and simple. And it's such a letdown after everything that came before it."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Actually, I don't really like not recommending a work, because good or bad, anime is one of the animations that requires a lot of money to make.But after watching this anime, I don't think I can recommend it.The first mistake in my opinion is the spoiler that is clearly displayed at the beginning of the episode, when Boruto fights Kawaki, and Kawaki said that the Shinobi era is over, from here the conclusion can be drawn that they will fight like the previous series Naruto vs Sasuke.Another conclusion from me is that the Shinobi Era will truly end and move to the Modern Era, this...is just my speculation.Second, from the character design, I think the children in the Boruto era are made too simple, especially the children of the previous veterans.Taking some parts of his parents' designs and applying them to his son, for example Metal Lee, his eyebrows became thicker and his eyes became blacker and bigger, then slightly changing the shape of his face, Likewise with Choji's son and the other children, I don't think I need to explain much about this because you can see for yourself.Third, the Modernization Era, before entering the Boruto series, in the last few episodes of Naruto, this modernization era has begun to be seen, but not as striking as in the Boruto era.For example, there was one of the children who brought a laptop during Boruto's first fight against Iwabe.When someone says chakra, the kid with the laptop seems to be searching on Google and says that Chakra is blah blah blah...Are kids this stupid in the Boruto era? To the point of having to find out through his laptop? Even in the Naruto era, Sakura was able to explain what Chakra was without looking at the laptop, lol.Fourth, the storyline seems to just repeat the Naruto era, but slightly, just a little different from before, For example, Naruto wants to become Hokage and always feels lonely because there is no one around, in Boruto it is enough to reverse the situation.The conclusion of the Boruto series is that it only brings almost the same story, but changes it a little.And what exactly do you want to show in this Boruto Era?Entering the academy? Exams at the Academy? Even the epic battle against Akatsuki is already in Naruto, Will the Boruto Era show the same thing, but just a different generation? The point is there is nothing special about the Boruto Era, because everything will definitely be compared to the Naruto Era.I think it would be better if it ended in the Naruto Era after the Shinobi War, and Naruto was inaugurated as Hokage, and in the end everyone lived happily.If you really insist on having a sequel, I think it would be better to skip the story after a few years, like other series such as Zoids, Avatar The Last Airbender, Even idol anime like Love Live was also skipped first to move on to other idol generations.The point I want to say is, if you want to make a continuation of the Naruto story, it would be better to do it in the same world, but in a different generation after a few years have passed, after the Naruto Era.A simple example is the anime Zoids Chaotic Century and Zoids Zero, which still tell the story of Zoids but the two of them don't meet each other. and Zoids Chaotic Century are just memories,  so even though they are in the same World, they are really far apart in generation!Why do I say that? Because Naruto and Boruto are too close, so there will be comparisons between the two, I even saw in one of the videos that there was a kid who could use an earth technique that filled the match area, WTF! Even in the Naruto exam era, those who used the Kyuubi's power weren't that powerful, the problem was that they were still young, how could they have such great power in the Boruto era?Apart from that, previous characters like Naruto and his friends were made too simple, such as their hair style, For example, Sasuke was so cool in his time, but now he's not as cool as he used to be. I know that they've entered adulthood, but they shouldn't be made to look bad either. Even Naruto's parents, who already have children, still look cool, as do the other elders in Naruto's era.The point is that the Naruto Era characters were made as bad as possible so that they don't stand out in the Boruto Era.I understand that because this is the Boruto series, but unfortunately, none of Boruto's characters and the others are cool, as explained before.Finally, Naruto and Boruto are too close, so there will be comparisons between the two, especially Naruto fans, there are many, and they will definitely feel disappointed why it can be like this in the Boruto Era.It is true that this is the next generation, but they are still humans, not machines, so the difference in strength should not be too far from the previous Naruto series.For example, like the child who released the Earth element in the Stadium Area earlier, a child that small already has strength and chakra that is too excessive, If we compare, a child that small is already at Jounin or Hokage level."
Yuzuki-san Chi no Yonkyoudai.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this one. It's not easy to balance tones of an SoL with four boys living together in the same house getting up to all kinds of shenanigans with the emotional weight of their lost parents, but the show manages it pretty well all things considered. It might get just a little too light-hearted at times, but when it downshifts, you're going to feel the water works coming on. The neighbors as well were a good complement to everything happening on screen, with, in particular, Uta rising to the top.Everyone gets at least some moments to shine, so none of the characters feel...tacked on, even if some end up outshining the others. In particular, we spent a lot of time on Minako and Mikoto, who both get very well fleshed out, though I wish we'd gotten to more insight into Hayato, the boy who spent the most time with his parents and feels the greatest weight of expectation. It also could have filled us in more on the parents, who have personalities, but lack any real character depth due to a lack of screen presence.I think this series is at its absolute best when its showcasing what it can do with animation, whether that's transitioning to a much more clearly drawn style with exaggerated motions or literally having our characters running through real streets in a scene that had me laughing. I wish we could have gotten more of these inventive scenes, but the ones that were in here popped all the more as a result.I can see some room for improvement, but most of that could be solved with a S2 that, unfortunately, it's unlikely to get. Still, this was a lovely experience."
Look Back,"haven't seen many anime like this, I just had to say that movies like this or animes like Mononoke or Haibane Renmei shouldn’t be rated the same way as other anime. They’re the kind of works that don’t need a lot of plot development, instead, they really shine in the meaning between the lines that the creators leave. The details in each scene and the pacing are different from other stuff, and what matters most is the feeling you get from understanding the message. The creators didn’t just make these for money, they wanted to share something that doesn’t hinge on the series’ continuity. They’re...more like artists trying to express their feelings so we can all see it the way they do. Very few one-shots make it to cinemas, and even fewer get adapted as well as this one. You can tell a lot of care went into making this film."
Bocchi the Rock!,"Amazing show.Love the characters, love the comedy, love the music, i love everything about it. I seriously dont think there's a single bad thing about this show.It's fun, it's really well animated, the voice actresses did an amazing job, and the music is seriously great! I picked this anime as the first one to show a friend of mine that has always had a negative opinion on anime (because of the questionable people and fan-service heavy shows) and she absolutely fell in love with it and now actively asks me to recommend more anime that i think she'd enjoy. Can't wait for the...next movie/seasons.Also I recently started playing the bass and part of the reason why is this show being the push I had needed for a long time to finally trying it out (I've always wanted to play it). Ryo >>.10/10."
Akebi-chan no Sailor-fuku,"""A lot of quality wasted""Pack your backpack e be ready for best time of your life, full of joy and fun; is that how people remember their days of school? hard would be one experience that doesn't share their bad days as a student, and that's something ""Akebi-chan no Sailor-fuku"" should've treated too.The anime is beautiful; really beautiful, extremely gourgeous, artstyle and soundtrack is the two aspects that impresses for the detail excellence, the ambient is perfect craved, and that will make the viewer discomfortable at some point, the excess distracts and make it difficult to connect with the world, the magic is on the...moments viewers are deserved of beauty, if everything is wonderful at all time, nothing is trully a highlight, but the hobbies kinda benefits from that. Art here is a spectacle of simbolism and meaning, sports are thrilling and what is strength when overcoming limitations and frustations, winning or losing, every hobbie is well described, how hard is to start something new that brings joy and satisfaction in the end, and how time and dedication is the only way of improving your skills, and every girl on the show helps reinforce the ideia of learning at your own pace.In classroom there's a lot of diversity, every girl have their own unique interests, but they took ""diversity"" quite literal and took one important dinamic of sharing common interests, there are too many characters and subjects, decreasing everything and everyone would help the entire anime feels more fleshed out, and somehow, they trying to use ""Akebi"" to compensate it, poor one who's the star of the show but ends up serving as a narrative tool so the cast has a reason develop their own arcs and conflicts, has sacrificed her own development to be a solutions for the girls, in the last episode when she could feel like her own character, ""Erika"" walks in and takes all the spolight. The cast has a severe consistency problem, there is no time for everyone, so much good characters who basically don't come out of scratches, it would need a least three separately shows to accommodate ideally all this characters.The anime is quite fun being just a thing on screen, it does have a lot of variety and a lot to offer as a distraction, but it can't be taken serious, if you do, you will get out frustated and unsatisfied.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------""Muita qualidade que é um desperdício""Arrume a sua mochila e se prepare para os melhores momentos da sua vida, cheio de alegria e diversão; será que é assim que as pessoas se lembram dos seus dias de escola? Difícil seria uma experiencia sequer que não tivesse passado por maus bocados no seu tempo de estudante, e ""Akebi-chan no Sailor-fuku"" deveria ter tratado disso também.O anime é lindo; muito lindo; extremamente lindo, a arte e a trilha sonora são os dois aspectos que impressionam pela excelência nos detalhes, todo o ambiente é prefeitamente esculpido, e quem assiste com certeza vai se sentir desconfortável em algum momento, o exagero distraí e dificulta o sentimento de querer se conectar com esse mundo, a magia está nos momentos ideais em que o telespectador se sente merecedor do belo, se tudo é maravilhoso a todo tempo, nada se destaca de verdade, no entanto os passatempos se beneficiaram com isso. A forma como a arte é expressa é um verdadeiro espetáculo de simbolismo e significado, os esportes são emocionantes e o que é a força de superar as limitações e frustações nas vitórias e derrotas, toda atividade é muito bem descrita, as dificuldades de se começar algo novo e a satisfação e alegria de conseguir conquistar os objetivos, e de como a dedicação e tempo é a única maneira de aperfeiçoar as suas destrezas, e cada garota fortalece esse conceito de cada um aprender no seu próprio passo.Nessa turma a gente encontra bastante diversidade, cada garota tem seu interesse único, mas a diversidade foi levada tão ao pé da letra que tirou uma dinâmica essecial de se compartilhar os mesmos interesses, existe personagens e assuntos demais, reduzir tudo e todos ajudaria a tornar o show mais interessante, e de alguma forma, acabaram usando a ""Akebi"" para tentar compensar isso, a coitada que é a estrela do show acaba apenas servindo como uma ferramenta narrativa para que o elenco possa desenvolver seus próprios arcos e conflitos, sacrificando seu desenvolvimento para ser a solução aos problemas das outras garotas, no último episódio em que ela pode se dedicar ao seu próprio personagem, ""Erika"" entrou e roubou merecidamente todo o holofote pra sí. O elenco tem um grave problema de continuidade, não há tempo suficiente para ninguém, uma pena ver tantos personagens bons não saírem basicamente do rascunho, seria preciso no mínimo três shows separados para acomodar todos esses personagens de forma ideal.Esse show diverte quando não se tem nada para assistir, tem tantas propostas e variedade que serve muito bem como fundo ou distração, mas não da para se levar à sério, se escolher investir no enredo vai sair daqui frustado e insastisfeito."
"Tadaima, Okaeri","Just a kind of nothing burger. I feel like everyone's character development, especially HIromu and the Masaki, had a chunk of their character development off screen three years ago. In the omega's case he does learn and grow, and he's the character that changes the most throughout the course of the show, but it wasn't enough to keep me properly engaged. The two side characters, Matsuo and Yuki had more chemistry than the main duo, but the bar is still in hell. The twins did not need to be there. Masaki's cousin was okay I guess but I don't even remember his name.The kids...are cute i guess. There are some cute moments in the show that made me laugh, but it really isn't enough. I wish the kids were more annoying. They felt too perfectly cute. Kids are fucking little assholes, thats what makes the cute moments even cuter. They felt really flat.My main issue with the show is its treatment of omegaverse. I am no omegaverse connoisseur, but I am on Tumblr, so I know a fair bit. I will give the show credit: it does utilize the omegaverse trope throughout the whole show... but it doesn't really do it well. And I think that's the highest insult.For the uninitiated, omegaverses across media can vary **very wildly,** and there's really only a few general rules--and even those rules get broken. The show generally follows the main ""rules."" For the sake of gross simplification, generally speaking alphas are the semes, ukes are omegas that can get pregnant, people release ""pheromones"" like wolves, omegas go into heat, and omegas/alphas do mating marks. Betas also exist. (No one knows what betas do in this hierarchy. Not even tumblrinas.)These are the only real rules Tadaima Okaeri follows, which usually would be a great thing--shows that feature an original cast must have a very nuanced/well thought out/unique take on the omegaverse. But those are the only rules it follows because Tadaima, Okaeri doesn't remember anything else. Packs are flown out the window, despite the four or five rotating dudes that keep inviting themselves over to the main couples house. Even stilll, the only real rule that Taidama Okaeri cares about for most of its run is that alphas are semes and ukes are omeagas, with the other stuff not appearing until the final conflict. Something interesting that Tadaima Okarei does do is that omegas and alphas aren't encouraged to be together; what's normal in this verse is dating within your type. This is the main piece of worldbuilding that drives a lot of the show, and to be fair, I've never seen anything like it before. However, it ends up just being a copy paste bad discrimination story, and you could honestly replace it with ""they disapprove of this marriage because I'm gay/transgender"" and really nothing would change.I'm just... who is it for? Back when this was airing every anituber i saw treated this like it had the fucknig measles, and while we're all allowed to have our likes and dislikes, this show was so milquetoast that the fear from people like Glass Reflection seems like it's for a different show. that's another thing, despite omegaverse being what this show is about, it never really leans into the strangeness of it all. Masaki literally has gets pregnant and has a baby in the middle of the series, and all we get is him saying ""I'm having a baby"" to a jump cut of the baby in their crib. Like, seriously? The only people watching this are comfortable with omegaverse content, they can withstand a pregnant man. It just felt like it never wanted to commit to anything weirder than it's bland discrimination angle. And even still, even still!! With that discrimination angle we never saw anything beyond how people in the couple's personal lives felt about it. Nothing about systemic opression of omegas, which IMO, you HAVE to deal with if your'e doing an omegaverse with original characters.Overall this is a hard skip, for both casual BL fans, omegaverse fans, and everyone else. Don't waste your time.Also the budget for this show appears to be four pieces of lint and a toothpick, but since this is a BL, that's kinda a rite of passage."
Dandadan,"It has been 7 episodes in and the show has taken a strange turn. The first three episodes were amazing and got me hooked. But at some point, it feels like they just started subplots everywhere and I don't know where the story is going anymore. It seems like this entire season will end up just being an introduction, just like with Chainsaw Man.The animation is great. It's clear they put a lot of effort into it. My only complaint was that in the latest episode there was a bit of CG but it wasn't as horrible as Overlord. I also understand why they did...it because it was hard to animate ""that thing"". Besides that one very minor issue, the animation has been top notch.The main plot is great. It's perfectly described in the synopsis. Ken and Momo have a bet on whether aliens or spirits exist, it turns out both of them do and they get hunted by them. The first 3 episodes revolve around this and it has been amazing. However, I do not appreciate how they try to shoehorn romance. Ken and Momo are pretty funny as friends. A lot of the humor works because they are friends and not lovers. But for some reason we are throwing all of that away for a weak romantic subplot. Not only that, but it feels like it moves too fast. How are you going to start teasing romance literally like 2 days after these characters meet. I hope it goes nowhere.The humor is sometimes too vulgar for my liking. I also don't appreciate that it's that vulgar in a school setting. When it's not vulgar, it's pretty funny.I like the cast so far as well. This is the first time where I don't get completely annoyed by the ""shy nerd"" archetype. Ken, despite being shy and introverted, is pretty valuable to the show's comedy and has a lot of great moments. It's impressive how they did that while still remaining true to his archetype.Despite my complaints, this has been a very enjoyable watch. After every episode I feel sad that I have to wait for a week again."
Waza no Tabibito,"Waza no Tabibito is obviously not that appealing at the first glance and you'd be right the sound design is pretty poor especially for something from 2011 and the characters and story are quite lackluster as well but the most appealing part is the art style which gives nostalgic vibes from early video game cgi trailers.Waza no Tabibito looks,feels and even sounds like late ps1 early ps2 era trailers and it was quite a journey to watch it.So if you have 30minutes to spend and want to delve back into some old buried memories give Waza no Tabibito a shot."
Black★Rock Shooter (OVA),"I watched a video where a guy, with well-deserved contempt, talked about another guy who urged the shooting of Ukrainians in Poland like a dog.I watched a video that explained why the game ""Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City"" came out so awful.Generally there was a lot of explaining the manipulation of the anti-Ukrainian narrative and comparing, quite rightly, to how Jews in a certain country run by a mustachioed artist were perceived.Capcom generally initially wanted to do a remake of ""Resident Evil 2"", but it ended up happening much later, so they used RE 2 as a backdrop for the events in a completely new...spin-off.Confused? That's basically the feeling you'll get when watching Black★Rock Shooter (by the way, does it read Black Star Rock Shooter or Black 9733 Rock Shooter?).STORY ?/10The OVA is basically two films: one is a quiet slice of life about two schoolgirls who become friends, the other is action scenes with the titular Black★Rock Shooter. And the two films hardly interact with each other for the entire OVA. It's like if you watch ""Clannad"" and you get fight scenes from ""Gurren Lagann"" once in a while, and only towards the end it somehow comes together.And this is where I have trouble judging the plot, because it's so disconnected. But on the other hand, there is a plot about two female friends whose friendship is sincere, but is also put to the test to a certain extent over time. And the fight scenes with Black★Rock Shooter are genuinely good, although they only account for about one-fifth of the total. Even linking these threads somehow works, but only somehow, because it only adds confusion to the whole.Therefore, it is probably impossible to judge it objectively. Others will see it as an avant-garde endeavour, while others will see it as simply a big mess pointlessly glued together with saliva and duct tape.GRAPHICS 8/10Something I can certainly objectively assess, and positively, is the animation. Everything is nice, even though the two styles contrast quite a bit. The school part of the OVA is bright and pleasant, while the action part is more dark and packed with fluid fights with ok choreography. Both convey the atmosphere of their parts very well.CHARACTERS 6.5/10About the characters, I can say less: they are done OK. Don't expect depth of character here like, for example, in Violet Evergarden, but nobody here is annoying. On the other hand: nobody is particularly memorable. Even Black★Rock Shooter can at best be described as stoic, as she appears very little in her own anime (we like to call it ""The Witcher of Netflix"" syndrome). And that's about it. Surprisingly, it's the more down-to-earth characters, in the form of the two schoolgirls, that are more distinct and interesting, but that doesn't make them three-dimensional. They are easy to like, but not so easy to love. The most important thing is that it is easy to believe in their friendship, which is not, in my opinion, somehow overdone and even comes out naturally.Provided you are not an introvert: for such an individual, any form of human interaction is an anomalous concept. A colleague of mine who I forced to talk to a woman in a manga shop can confirm this. We aren't friends anymore.MUSIC 7/10Funnily enough, it all started with music sung by Hatsune Miku, from which the energy of the early second millennium beats so strongly that I felt like I had jumped into a DeLorean and was listening to the Nightcore version of ""Monster"" by Skillet again.The music in the OVA doesn't have that feel, and just as we have basically two unrelated films, we have soundtracks that are different for them. Again: both are done well, capturing different atmospheres, although not brilliantly. It's hard for me to say more than that, so I'll shorten it to ""calm music makes you calm, and energetic music gives you a little boost as you walk through the school corridor"".AVERAGE SCORE: 7/10""Black★Rock Shooter"" is a title from which I did not expect such complications when reviewing it. I give it a good rating because there's nothing to fault on the technical aspects, but the story element is so strange and alien that even ""FLCL"" seems like a generic isekai title. Many years ago, when I was still in middle school and didn't watch anime regularly, on a school trip a classmate gave me an anime about teleporting lesbians to watch (which to this day I still haven't been able to find). This anime was still more understandable to me than ""Black★Rock Shooter"". Is that bad? No, because once in a while we need to expose ourselves to something completely different from our norm.In fact, this makes ""Black★Rock Shooter"" not so much good, but unique. And I will always choose something unique over something done correctly but tasteless."
Yuu☆Yuu☆Hakusho,"I was told this anime was exceptional, mainly because it shares the same author as Hunter x Hunter. It’s true that the story is complex and promising on paper. However, the anime is a huge disappointment.The animation quality is seriously lacking: the movements are stiff, the animation techniques are poor, and the direction fails to be engaging. Worse still, the pacing of the anime is poorly handled, making it hard to enjoy.These combined flaws completely ruin the potential of the work, making it an adaptation that’s almost impossible to recommend. A real disappointment for something that could have been a hidden gem."
Chiyu Mahou no Machigatta Tsukaikata,"A big factor that made me stay at the show was its great opening, I can't doubt that it really gives me goosebumps.The plot is like everything you would expect from an isekai, only this one is not as flashy or sexualized as it is usually sold.The training is one of my favorite processes and it was well executed. I like the personality of the MC because even though he is ""normal"" he is not flat as a character.The secondary characters serve their purpose and are enjoyable, I especially liked that there is a female boss, who is not stripping every second and is actually...a fighter, it feels fresh and fun.The character designs are brilliant, you literally see some cute designs and the animation is quite presentable, I think you will like it.I'm looking forward to the second season!"
Koi wa Ameagari no You ni,"I have seen positive reviews saying that this is a rather wholesome anime for its kind. Three episodes in, I somehow understand the main guy's life and it doesn't seem pervy, but still as a 40-year-old non-Japanese man with a different perspective of age of consent, the relationship kept creeping me out. The young girl who doesn't even notice the boys around her own age but falls for the first random middle-aged guy who shows her the slightest affection and care, clearly has issues. Especially that so far her father seems absent. I'm still not sure whether I'll keep watching or I'll drop it and...stick to childcare genre."
Touken Ranbu Kai: Kyoden Moyuru Honnouji,"This anime is not exactly based on the original game, but based on the live action 2.5D stage play, where real people play the roles of the original 2D characters. It's anime adaptation of the live action adaptation of the original game. I don't know why they decided to go with that concept. Not like most of the other Touken Ranbu adaptations, stage one has its own detailed setting and overarching storyline, and it's pretty divisive too. So I think they should make it clear every time they promote this anime or sell collaboration products that it's based on the 'stage: touken ranbu'. For me,...finding that out wasn’t exactly pleasant.Even putting that aside, this anime is disappointing.The animation is not bad, I guess. But there is no consistency in the character design. They do resemble the official character illustration though. There are scores of different illustrators in Touken Ranbu, and in this show, each character looks like they're from completely different anime. The other Touken Ranbu anime Hanamaru and Katsugeki have their own animation style, i'm not sure this one does. Even the same character looks different in every scene, as if they don’t have a proper design for this series. Really distracting.The story is nothing special. It's too predictable. They also failed to get people to sympathize with the characters because they didn't explain much while dragging out the story unnecessarily. The way they portray the characters is subpar. Some characters were deliberately made into jerk or stupid for the sake of the plot's convenience. This anime lacks character development and throws in fanon tropes without much thought. It's shocking when Fudou Yukimitsu call Yamanbagiri Kunihiro ""manba chan""Maybe that would have been all okay if this was some fan service anime just introducing characters like Hanamaru. But they tried to create a complete story, and selected the characters for that purpose, deciding who to focus on and who to leave out. If the story had to be reused from the stage, at least it should've been made to stand out as an anime. This anime has no identity.No offense, but please let this 2.5D playwright just write plays. This is more of an overblown tribute to the stage play and is intended to lower the entry barrier to the live-action stuff. For the most part, they didn’t satisfy both stage fans and original game fans.I don't really hate the stage play itself, but as a long time fan of the Touken Ranbu, I want Touken Ranbu anime that is based on the original game. Especially when they're casting official voice actors. Seriously, in what kind of medium does the official voice actor who voiced the original character, end up playing that character based on the live-action actor's portrayal?Plus saniwa character in this anime feels out of place. The production doesn't seem to respect their audience at all."
"Maou-sama, Retry! R","So as for the first season, I really enjoyed it. But the second season....the second season....what in the world happened? In all my years of watching anime I have never seen an anime change so drastically from one season to the next as this anime has. Its like a totally different anime. The quality has diminished. Not sure about sub but english dub has changed in some ways. I worry for its future. I hate seeing anime not finish its story.I will trudge along and continue watching. Even though it makes me a little sad for the anime, its not the worst."
Vampire Hunter D (2000),"The aesthetics the story the characters, everything is a masterpiece as long as vampires, a gothic style and tragic storytelling are among your preferences. The first movie was really good but had it's weird bits, goofy disgusting or straight up annoying enemy fodder designs, a weird progression to the plot and the aged animation were very noticeable. Here everything is fixed and not just that but take to a completely new level. Cleaner designs, with much less needless techy sci-fi nonsense, enemies and all characters in general were really interesting and unique. Just an absolute masterpiece, the movie that would come out if what I...and possibly many others love was put together in the best way possible."
Ame wo Tsugeru Hyouryuu Danchi,"From my perspective, the story is unique. I watched it with my siblings. I like to enjoy adventure films where a child does something interesting. This anime's storyline is good, and the twist is normal, but it takes time to understand the main story.Though it is a fictional anime story, the characters are not well expressed in an emotional way. However, some points are really good, like how children are straightforward and can't make good decisions. These things are nicely shown in the anime.I think it will be awesome for those children. The attachment to the place in our memories is...shown perfectly. I'm sure they will enjoy this anime."
Violet Evergarden Gaiden: Eien to Jidou Shuki Ningyou,"I was hoping for some world class Yuri after feeling quite disappointed after the santa claus special, but it was just fine I guess.Animation beautiful as always, though that's something to be expected when you're dealing with Violet. Sometimes it looks so beautiful I Feel like it's all just passing me by, so overwhelming.The story was ok. I wasn't expecting the time with her little sister to be the bulk of it, I thought we'd be spending way more time at the school. The sister dynamic is interesting, and it went somehwere I wasn't really expecting; but it didn't blow me out of the...water or anything. Lil sis's relationship with Benedict is cute though, and I liked it.Movie was nothing special overall, but not insulting."
Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e,I watched this anime in an attempt of trying to get out of the not watching anime phase now I can’t say if I’m out of that phase but I was definitely able to binge it and with that said it is a good anime it explores something very interesting concepts and ayanokoji is a very interesting character the ending really gets touched for what is going to happen next as for the animation it’s fine puts me off at times especially kushida i hate her as of now but I think there will be more to explore about her character but for now 7.6/10...as interesting as it is it is really nothing to crazy but still a worthy watch I have very high expectations for the next season
Mahoutsukai ni Narenakatta Onnanoko no Hanashi,"This anime is just inherently frustrating to watch.While the visuals and art style are pretty to look at (even tho the actual animation leaves a lot to be desired, but hey this is J.C. Staff we're talking about), the anime just completely fails on the plot department, and this can really only be explained by a single, simple point: the characters are so agonizingly unmotivated.Not only does it make the plot agonizing to watch through, as the MC gives up after only a couple failures (often not even trying at all!!!), it also completely contradicts anything we're told by the plot, as a couple of...the main cast would do anything to become magicians and yet not even try to do what their teacher is teaching them.Kurumi, the MC, is especially bad because of this, she's actually kinda charming, but her giving up at literally any point, despite the story starting by showing her working her ASS OFF to get into the magic school, is almost rage inducing at some points when she can't even move her own ass when her friends are in real danger. She just ends up becoming very unlikeable when she keeps talking about her dream of being a magician, being handed literally EVERYTHING she needs to become one, and not ONCE, NOT. ONCE. do you see her practice with the same fervent motivation that was shown in the first episode when she was studying for the entrance exams.This anime could've been pretty decent, even good! But the writers just completely dropped the ball on the story, and the parts I mentioned aren't even close to being the only things that don't work in the story"
Tokidoki Bosotto Russia-go de Dereru Tonari no Alya-san,"What's with the hype? The cute chemistry was the only thing that kept me motivated, to say the least. But plot and story? Garbage. So, it started out interesting but then it progressively gets worser and appailing. I get it, they're cute together but c'mon, they didn't have to spend a whole 12 episodes talking about the same topic over and over again...  Although the concept of this ""hides her feelings in russian"" was creative at first, it got boring and cringe as fuck as the time goes on. I suggest yall to wait for s2 and skip this useless s1. This took me...DAYS to finish, if it was really that good stuff I would've finished it within a day. After all that hard work of speed running, this anime NEVER answered any of the plot holes. At the end, if you really wanna watch it for the fanservices or animations, go for it, it might be worth, somehow. But, NEVER watch for the plot or story, or else there weren't be any point of watching this."
Dandadan,"A mission to restore a boy's male identity has never been this interesting or taken to this level of extremity before. This show is literally a drug hallucination with school romance at its core. So far, each episode would either leave you laughing to tears, completely confused at what the heck just happened, or grieving alongside the characters. Dandadan is arguably the most chaotic yet watchable show of 2024.Dandadan's story is a testament that extraterrestrial and supernatural beings can team up and wreak havoc in ways that put Jujitsu Kaisen's Shibuya Arc to shame. Despite the craziness, the story manages to show supernatural beings have...souls too. Therefore, either recruit them to your side or simply exorcise them. Now, probably the best part of this show: the main characters. First we have Okarun, a dense UFO nerd whose curiosity lands him in hot water in the most ridiculous way possible. How this emotional trainwreck fights arguably gives life to the show. Then we have Momo, our star girl of the show who can control spirits and is truly the right girl for him. Of course, you can't go wrong with a wise granny backing you up on a ghost/alien hunt. All characters are crazy, yet balance each other in ways that make the show watchable.This show's most iconic element (so far) is also it's biggest flaw: a million things happening at the same time. It would be an issue if you like stuff explained to you, but it won't be an issue if you like plots with unpredicablity. Keep in mind, the mission to make Okarun a man again is the heart of every mission. Watch this show if you want to experience every emotion (e.g. laugh, cry, cringe) known to mankind in every episode. There is more to this insanity than meets the eye. Follow the story at your own risk/enjoyment."
Look Back,"Look Back is a film based on the on the one-shot web manga of the same name by Tatsuki Fujimoto. Here is why I think Look Back deserves a 10/10.I liked the anime, Chainsaw Man, which is an adaptation of the manga of the same name by Fujimoto. I gave Chainsaw Man a 10/10 as well.This film touches on the difficulty of maintaining your passion, friendships, and life goals at the same time. It touches on the idea that one may find it easier to abandon their passion to reconnect with friends or to reconnect with their passion and make new friends. It touches on...the disconnect between some parents and their kids relating to ideal life goals. It touches on the idea that one's passion to achieve a goal may be unfeasible and that it may be more realistic for one to reach for a more feasible goal even if it does not align with one's own passion. I related to these concepts a lot.The film also portrays the effect perfectionism can have on one's motivation and achievements. I felt like Fujino and Kyomoto were potentially a portrayal of Fujimoto's creativity growing up and the emotions creators go through to create art. I liked how this was incorporated in this animated film. The core takeaway from this film is the critical role of resilience in achieving success, highlighting that the path to success is rarely linear. It captures the essence that setbacks and challenges are inevitable, but it's resilience that propivates one forward. The narrative makes it clear that without resilience, success remains elusive. For those who feel they've given up, the film offers hope, suggesting there's always an opportunity to muster resilience and start anew.Moreover, the film adeptly explores the repercussions of overgeneralisation and flawed logic. It delves into how such cognitive distortions can lead to the misattribution of blame for unfortunate events, both to oneself and to others. This theme serves as a poignant critique on how our thought processes influence our emotions. It provides viewers with insights into managing psychological distress through a more constructive mindset, encouraging a shift in perspective that fosters resilience and emotional recovery.Time heals.Also, THEIR SHIP NAME IS LITERALLY FUJIMOTO <3"
Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru,"If this anime has 10 millions haters, im one of them. If this anime has 1 hater, then its me. If this anime has no hater then im dead. If the entire world loves this anime, then im against the world.Seriously, my boyfriend is a fan of it and im watching it because im interested in everything... but this... this is baaaadLike please this is just an ecchi about a 15YO girl (help)Im a girl and i am even more desapointed to learn that the manga was written by a woman... since when showing a teenager body is ok ?Maybe she wanted to show...girl empowerement, like ""you girls can do whatever you want, show your bodies, be free !"" but this is not a good way to do it. This anime/manga doesnt help women rights at all...Ive seen girls and women loving the character of Marin, and idk how to feel about it. Okay shes just a girl living her passion, but in fact she is a 15yo girl dressing up as a bdsm game character (wtf?)I cant help but thinking about the adult men fantasizing about this girl, and thinking its ok because shes not real... but i guess it is something normal in the anime community ?I will NEVER understand the hype, this is gross in a loooot of way..."
Pokemon Concierge,"Y'know what, it's ok. The animation is fucking so beautiful and meticulous, it deserves a recommendation on that alone. Everything looks and is beautiful, and every pokemon is so damn cute. The art is as cozy as the show is, everything makes you feel warm and fluffy. Great show to watch with your parents.Story wise, it's pretty milquetoast, but it is damn cute. The characters are.... there, and theyre just as cute as the pokemon, and therefore aren't super interesting. But this really didn't need to be a high octane drama, so I can't be too mad. They were serviceable and I was never...annoyed or pissed off at them making dumb decisions, but I can't say I remember any of their names.If you're super into pokemon i don't think you'll have any issues loving this, but if you're less into it, like me, it's ok. I would still recommend it as cozy watching. I do want a psyduck plushie now..... Dammit capitalism!!"
Kidou Senshi Gundam 0080: Pocket no Naka no Sensou,"Really beautiful fucking show. We're missing the giant robot battles, but the beautiful 90s cel animation more than makes up for it.Each character in this is perfect, no notes, does exactly what they need to do while still being so loveable. Alfie, Bernie, and Chris are lovely to watch.The overall theme and plot was great too, everything hit when it shouldve hit, great pacing.Just a heart wrenching story, and my favorite gundam story so far. Highly highly reccomend it, you can watch it without any gundam knowledge at all. Though, I don't think it's a good series to introduce you to gundam,...as its missing the big set pieces + high octane fights. But that doesn't make WIP any less valuable."
Shingeki no Kyojin,"I watched AOT 2 years ago. Before watching this anime series, I don't regularly watch anime. Attack on Titan is the best anime I have watched. This anime's plot, storyline, and characters are awesome. I feel a connection with the character. At first, I liked Eren and also fell in love with the Mikasa character. She likes Eren. I feel attached to Attack on Titan. After completing this anime I continued the watching anime journey.My favorite characters are Eren, Mikasa, and Levi. Suppose anyone watches this anime's first season without any skips and continues without any breaks. Then I'm sure he/she will enjoy the...show.Thanks to ""Hajime Isayama"" for writing this type of anime story."
Promare,"""When I said take me to the moon,I never meant take me aloneI thought if mankind toured the starsit meant that all of us could go.""- Penelope Scott, RätThe premise of Promare is simple. 30 years ago, some people randomly developed fire powers and are now an oppressed minority group (called the ""burnish"" here). It's a plot I'm sure you've seen before, especially if you've ever engaged with a single piece of X-Men media. However the way it approaches its plot surprised me with how much depth and nuance they were able to pack into a two hour action flick.The main character of the...story is a young man named Galo. He is a very proud, passionate young man who carries nothing but love and kindness in his heart, so he dedicates his time to protecting the city as part of a special force meant to apprehend burnish terrorists. He's very charming with how passionate he is about doing the right thing. However, he's also a perfect character for this story because of one thing: unconscious bias.Most people would not consider themselves bigoted. In fact, most people would be offended at the idea they could be. And this is the problem. People who are granted privilege by society are often blind to what that privilege grants them as well as the reality of life for many minority groups, because they have never had to see that reality. Unlike minorities, they are capable of living in an echochamber that shields them from the truth of this world, and that's exactly what they do. This makes them susceptible to holding biases against these groups that even they are unaware of. They aren't aware of the fact that being kind and loving other people does not make you exempt from saying and doing discriminatory things.Galo gets offended when other people say all burnish are terrorists, yet when he knowingly talks to a burnish for the first time ever, he asks them if they need to eat as if they aren't human. He very clearly things of himself as Not Bigoted in regards to the burnish, yet he works for a police-esque group meant to suppress the burnish. As far as he is concerned, he's just catching terrorists because some burnish are terrorists even if it's not all of them, but he is completely ignoring the reality that this ""terrorist"" group is really just fighting for burnish rights and they have to resort to violence because it is the only way to make a difference. He thinks that if the burnish simply stopped being violent people would stop discriminating against them, because he lives in a happy, privileged world where everything is black and white.It is only through going out and meeting the burnish personally that he has his eyes opened, and it is because of that kindness and love he carries with him that his eyes are able to open. Empathy is an important skill to have, however it requires you to go out and actively try to use it. It cannot radicalize you if you never apply it.And thus from then on is a ""broken pedestal"" plot where he has to reckon with the fact that everything he held dear is actually a corrupt system meant to exploit and kill the burnish, and the man he idolized is very specifically exploiting the burnish for the benefit of only the ""elite"" of society.When the world ends, the rich are never around for it. They flee to space, to a private island, to anywhere other than here. Just how many spots are available on that ship? And just how many can afford them?I will say that the allegory isn't perfect (largely for a spoiler reason, but you could argue that anytime an allegorical minority actually does have something different about them that makes them dangerous it doesn't work), but I still felt like it worked well enough).Anyways, social commentary aside, the rest of the movie is good too.As expected of Trigger, the animation is absolutely delectable. I wasn't even that bored watching the action scenes because of how pretty they were!As for the other characters, the second most important character is Lio, the leader of the radical group. He serves as a good foil for Galo. Aina and her sister do well to add to the commentary (prioritizing your personal desires over doing what's right). The rest of the characters were also nice, if a bit underdeveloped, although that's to be expected with only a two hour runtime. It prioritizes action over character development, but it still managed to pack in enough character development to work.And of course, I can't complete this review without mentioning Gurrenn Lagann. The movie obviously bears a lot of similarities to Gurrenn Lagann because it was clearly made to be TTGL's spiritual successor, but that's certainly not a bad thing. They took exactly what made TTGL work and did something brand new with it in a way that does all of the same things right but still manages to feel fresh and interesting. It also seems to have paved the way for Trigger's later show BNA, which would have many of the same elements of social commentary, and that's definitely a good thing as well.Trigger definitely knows what it likes in its projects, and all of Trigger's signatures shine through in Promare in the best way possible."
Psycho-Pass Movie: Providence,"Oh, how the mighty have fallen.Where Psycho-Pass in its first season was an intelligent examination of the balances between societal control, justice, and idealism, it has with this film truly devolved into a mess of incomprehensible plotting featuring empty husks of characters with incoherent motivations. Other reviewers that disliked this film seem to also harbor harsh feelings toward season three, but I believe that to be mostly unfair. In fact, I would argue that consideration of the third season would be a good and quick way to identify what exactly is missing in Providence that made seasons one and three so much more memorable than...this drivel: good dialogue.Psycho-Pass is probably the talkiest cop show that actually warrants being taken seriously, a trait that is somewhat diminished in season three but almost entirely absent in Providence. The real key here is what is being spoken. With season one, the subject of discussions usually pertained to questions surrounding the push and pull between those three aforementioned topics; the cases being handled were mostly simple and were made even clearer to the audience by removing the whodunit factor by following the criminals around. One could even argue that these cases’ procedural details were largely irrelevant on a thematic level; how is a psychopathic high schooler murdering her classmates and posing them in grotesque homages to her father’s art even remotely pertinent to those debates of security and freedom? Short answer: it isn’t. The point of these murder cases is to demonstrate how criminality and, in tandem, judicial practices have changed in the world presented. This is actually what drew me to the series way back when: if the world is ostensibly a utopia, why are there still such horrific crimes being committed? That line of thinking is needed to dive deeper into the franchise’s central debate of security versus freedom, especially in the latter half.Season three was more of an episodic mystery show, meaning the perpetrators’ identities and methods were what were frequently explored in the dialogue. The reason this did not bother me but, in fact, kept me engaged week-to-week is that those topics were all in some way indicative of flaws in Sibyl; the point of these cases was that only a human would or even could have identified something as being problematic or the result of foul play, thus affirming the franchise’s thesis of the need for humanity’s individualistic agency, the value in having people control their own fates. That each case indicated different cracks in the system and society at large kept the season feeling routinely fresh, the other primary reason being that different characters were given the spotlight in each arc (with mixed and limited results, though I still respect the effort).But here we have Psycho-Pass: Providence, the entry where very little (especially of actual substance) is spoken. To pull back a bit and see how it contrasts with films as a whole, this is not inherently a bad thing, even if it is new to Psycho-Pass; I see this effort to inject longer bouts of silence as an attempt to be more contemplative and emphasize characters’ emotions more than developments in the world presented. Providence is really trying to be Blade Runner, a film where, even though the plot is paper thin and the dialogue is sparse and mostly uninteresting, the story is remarkably well-conveyed; there are few other films that utilize atmosphere and mood so effectively (see also Three Colors: Blue). All this is to say, however, that Providence is not the kind of film that employs atmosphere, visual fidelity, and shots of people watching life pass them by to great effect. This film fails as a psychological and emotional examination of quiet characters and their (in)humanity because both the franchise (most of it, anyway) and this film have always been more about the world and far less about the people in it. Providence tries to have it both ways and fails both ways; the few attempts at connecting the interpersonal, intrapersonal, and investigation-relevant problems the characters face to the franchise’s thesis of individualism, this time through religious metaphor, feel extremely forced in addition to being, in some ways, a retread (see the Sybil worshippers in season three).I should note that I don’t think it’s fair to call the film’s plot scattershot or even overly-convoluted. It is, however, damn near incomprehensible during an initial watch because the head of Psycho-Pass’ dialogue and characterization has never before been quite so firmly and deeply up its own ass. Those that have read critiques of season one will know this to be an actually rather remarkable feat. Providence has this idea in its head that the characters’ mere act of speaking like the Renaissance-era people they cosplay should automatically make them smart, and yet all the dialogue succeeded in doing was upset me by making once-interesting intellectual characters totally insufferable. This issue of extremely clunky dialogue is dwarfed, however, by the fact that, with all those contemplative silences, not enough is actually said about what is happening or why it matters. There is a wealth of missing information here that only serves to make the experience annoyingly confusing. Why characters do the terrible things they do was never quite clear to me, yet all these actions warrant further explanation beyond the fact that Psycho-Pass has a history of being grim-dark. The tragedy is that it’s now grim-dark with whatever points intended by the creators frustratingly muddled by the film’s shoddy presentation.If that was not bad enough, Providence also falls victim to the practice of not leaving well enough alone e.g. Kougami. To be fair, the problems with his characterization really started with his decision at the end of the third Sinners of the System film to effectively be an Enforcer all over again except for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, meaning he would be fighting foreigners and would use guns rather than Dominators (as such, the coolest sci-fi element of the franchise is largely absent from the film, dumb black hole gun notwithstanding; not exactly a great marketing ploy). The question I have is this: why is Kougami doing a bunch of 007 nonsense on behalf of a government for which he has no love? Here’s his arc across the franchise: in season one, he’d already fallen from grace, having resigned himself to being a state-sanctioned stone killer but who then proves himself to be an egotistical murdering bastard by the end. Psycho-Pass: The Movie and the third Sinners of the System film have him feeling tortured over his decision to execute Makishima; he wanders freely around Asia without any direction beyond wanting to do right by people, perhaps even in atonement for his sins, before making the boneheaded decision to return to Japan and be a state-sanctioned killer again because… freedom wasn’t what he thought it was? I bring all this up because Providence actually touches on this negation of his entire arc; he says that his current job helps people, which doesn’t make any sense considering he is still just an executioner for Sibyl. The film, in contrast to its attempt to be more emotionally introspective, makes no effort to have Kougami actually reflect and change or even effect healing within the people he had hurt with his betrayal. He calls up Akane, ostensibly to apologize (and only at the prompting of Professor Saiga), but instead tells her he regrets nothing. This is never brought up again. When this happened, I immediately laughed, cupped my hands around my mouth, and called out to my TV, “Nice apology, dicknuts!” Sure enough, Akane herself pretty much says the same thing after he hangs up. Though I had already suspected it, that moment was when I really knew this film was too dumb for me to enjoy.On the topic of 007 nonsense, I have a bit of a bone to pick with the action sequences in this film. I think the proper word to describe them is “overdone”, the reason being that they bill themselves as extremely climactic and lethally consequential but carry only a minimal amount of actual dramatic weight or narrative tension. To compare this to seasons one and three/First Inspector, confrontations between the detectives and criminals felt engaging because they were significant; characters and audiences both endured harrowing journeys to get there. That these scenes also made the effort to put the franchise’s themes front-and-center was competent writing. In Providence, none of the ideas being spouted during the confrontation had been examined in ways that really affect the characters and how they feel; the film plays catch-up in these few minutes on all the things it should have been doing with its dialogue and character interactions throughout the majority of its runtime. But no, it had to pretend to be more like Blade Runner while still appealing to the crowds who just want to watch characters and machines fight and blow up during a way-too-long climax with four different POVs running concurrently. It doesn’t help that there is also a feeling of diminishing returns with these action sequences. All of them look strong (even if the sound mixing goes completely out of whack, which I found annoying), but the sheer frequency and duration of these set pieces made them feel less like the integral next step of the story and more like fanservice in a way only a superhero film could be.And usage of the word “fanservice” is a decidedly apt choice to function as a segue to discussing the ways in which this film contributes to the setup of season three. Or, more accurately, should contribute but doesn’t. The long and short of it is that I found nothing in this film to explain anything in season three other than why Akane is behind bars; you’re probably not going to get any cathartic “Oh, that’s why!” kind of moment in relation to Shindo and Ignatov’s family history because what is provided doesn’t actually have any thought-provoking conflict behind it. Maybe I’d need to research this to know for sure, but I was too busy trying to parse out Shindo's father’s motivations to really notice anything of import (hint: I failed. Miserably). There is something that does bother me, though: why does Chief Kasei bleed after getting shot? Is she not an android avatar of Sybil, as evidenced by the fact that she was clearly an entirely mechanical being in season one? Or is Akane actually a murdering lowlife shitheel like Kougami now?If that's the case, then I called it back in December 2019: Akane Tsunemori is criminally asymptomatic.Chances are, though, the production team added the blood just to fool the in-universe press. Joke’s on them because they should have tried harder to fool me! Hahahahaaaaa!Although… I paid forty-five dollars preordering this shit from Crunchyroll, so…Ahh… fuck.- LC"
Jujutsu Kaisen,"14 episodes in and enjoying it for the entertainment value. However, people are out there saying JJK is going to replace one of the Big 3 if it keeps going. Ahhh, no. Unless it replaces the massively overrated, use filler as slow plot movement One Piece.JJK is a combination of a bunch of already existing anime characters, namely Naruto.Boy with demon inside him is only really recognized as strong by cold classmate. The elders in charge want him out of the picture because his power is too dangerous. Female classmate is loud and over the top but given no real screentime showing any true ability....Maybe after 200-250 episodes she will be useful after intense training. Their teacher is massively OP and recognized as the best of the best by friends and enemies, and he covers his eyes until he has to use his full power.There are literal direct pulls like the nine-tailed fox, the sushi chef in a Juju Short who is exactly the same as the Ramen guy, there is a woman who gets on the teachers case for him being so nonchalant, the tree dude from MHA is now a robot for the Kyoto school, the art design of so many (human) characters are pulls straight from other previously established anime, and so on.Like I said. Enjoyment factor is there, but it is by no means new material."
Juushin Enbu: Hero Tales,"6/10. Hero Tales is bland if you have watched a lot of anime I don't recommend if you are veteran anime fan. The story is short it's got a good plot it's easy to follow with a bunch of fun and interesting characters, it's visually very beautiful but it is a walking anime cliche. This is a great anime to suggest if you want to see if someone will like anime. The characters are unique but shallow but that's due to the briefs storyline. Typical shonen plot MC is a bit boring side characters are the real strength of the cast."
Dead Dead Demons Dededede Destruction (OVA),"Not entirely sure how to feel on this one.There were some really interesting aspects to it and I quite enjoyed the slice-of-life elements tied in with the sci-fi plot HOWEVER i feel like a lot of this series was throwing interesting ideas at the wall, without properly fleshing them out, to see what would stick.Pairing that with pacing that gives you whiplash and main characters who's motives are a little too unbelievable and you're left with something that had serious potential but ultimately misses the mark and falls flat on a lot of occasions.Is it entertaining? Sure, at times. Don't go into this...series expecting a perfectly tied together sci-fi epic though."
Lycoris Recoil,"Take Violet & Daisy (2011) - give them Gun Kata from Equilibrium (2002) - with the setup of Gunslinger Girl - and a relationship akin to Buddy Cop Films - place them in a future Utopian City less incriminated & controlling than Psycho-Pass (so far anyway), think rectify instead of avert - you get Lycoris Recoil.I wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was.  From episode 1 I was locked in and it managed to keep me locked in until the end.  The action was great and it was awesome to see it wasn't just added in to attract viewers....The slice of life moments were great too, the comedy wasn't forced and seemed natural to the moments/conversations especially by not repeating themselves on that front.The characters were well thought out as well.  Not one-dimensional, parodies or caricatures of cliché ""go to"" formula's.  Are they relatable to other characters that have been seen? of course; such is story telling and humans only have 76 personality types so quantifiably, even people in reality can get a bit familiar after reading/watching many stories along with getting older.  Sorry I digress yet what I have just said you can see in the characters in this story, the older characters act like ""9 to 5 again!"" and the lycoris are giving their all to become what they want to be.Many people who enjoy deep concepts without having the dialogue being too pretentious and complicated will certainly enjoy it just as much as those who can read between the many contextual lines presented for those who can.  And honestly, it makes it realistic, it trusts the audience can comprehend without having the characters explain obvious choices and actions."
Make Heroine ga Oosugiru!,"Starts off with an interesting premise, but ultimately doesn't really go anywhere with it. In fact, a large chunk of the show has nothing to do with any real romance at all, which is bizarre for something labelled as a romcom. Also bizarre that this is labeled a romcom when the majority of it is more of a drama. Not just drama, but kind of annoying melodrama in fact.The best thing I can say about this show is that it looks nice and has good music. Unfortunately aesthetics and production values can only take you so far. After the halfway point, I was already...pretty much done with it. It's a character driven show with relatively weak characters and not particularly interesting dialog. I guess some of the stuff with Komari was mildly relatable? Whenever I watch an anime that has an arc focused on club activities, I really have to wonder if Japanese students really care this much about this crap. Do they really take club activities this seriously to warrant so much drama?I don't get it. This is another one of those shows that makes me wonder if I'm getting too old for anime. Am I wrong? Are the zoomers praising this wrong? Am I annoyed that this turned out to be a completely different type of show than I expected? Am I being stupid for trying to wrap my head around some seasonal slop that just happens to have good animation? Who knows. All I know is that my eyes started to glaze over watching the last episode of this and I probably should have dropped this around episode 7.It's not bad, just mediocre."
Rejuvenation,"One of the last few traditional animation hentai before everything went digital. Even though the art is often beautiful and full of details (impressive for this genre), it looks like it was made in 1997 or something instead of 2000. Which is right for me though; I really love the style and character design, even if it looks a bit generic. There is just not enough 90's anime to scratch the itch.The story is good enough to keep you entertained and you'll probably be wanting for more after the unexplained, unexpected ending of episode 2. Also, tentacles, but sex scenes are mostly short anyway. Some...effort was put into the background music, which is refreshing. Not much else to say. Just a good, above average hentai of the late 90's. Nostalgic, fun, and pleasant."
Odd Taxi,"This is one of the most overrated anime I've ever seen.It does start out good, with the set up to the overarching plot and drama and the establishment of characters that would contribute to this. However, as more characters are introduced and the story has increasingly less reason to focus on MC all the time, the anime runs into the all-too-common problem of, not being able to tie up any loose ends and half-assing it at the end by using said increasingly irrelevant MC to act as an anchor.As always I will review this from a perspective of looking out for women's interests. The character...designs were completely uninspired, especially at the end, because every female character must be beautiful, while male characters are largely unattractive, whether good or evil, making me immediately dislike the anime. The female characters' motivations are at least explored somewhat.I can't say the same thing for the main character, Odokawa. His personality invites a strong feeling that there will be consistent exploration of his character and how it changes with the people he meets. However, despite the entire cast fawning over him in particular, he remains a static character who doesn't seem to have much presence in the world besides ""cool taxi driver."" He has no meaningful relationships, no contribution to any theme, no well-written reason to be so involved in the plot. I mean sure, he gets somewhat attached to one character in particular, but that nowhere near explains his zeal in getting involved in increasingly dangerous situations, including working with a criminal guy that he kinda-sorta hates (even though this guy namedrops the title in his fucking honor) that he attempts to murder but not really even though he has this sense of justice and fairness...? It is because of all of this, besides the obvious ""ugly guy gets the hot younger girl"" trope pushed on us over and over, that he comes across as a self-insert character for a certain male demographic. And his only memorable ""gimmick"", which gets fully explained by the end of the anime, makes absolutely no sense, because his view of the would should have been made fairly obvious in his behavior if he'd lived with that so long, and so many convenient steps were made to reach that discovery, like finding a hospital that managed to keep a fucking DIARY (not even medical documents) of his from elementary school that conveniently explained everything. I mean these side characters were DEVOTED to figuring him out, but in the end, none of this was acknowledged by Odokawa, because again, relationships with others don't affect him, and Odokawa rests well knowing that he doesn't have to put in any work to doing anything besides being cool and coming up with plans because the narrative caters to everything he does.This all leads to an extremely lackluster ending. In a very cheesy, extremely contrived, and anticlimactic slow-motion scene, everyone's problems are resolved and they all receive some philosophical awakening due to the poorly animated actions of the MC. And of course he is saved by a female character girlbossing her way to save him... somehow, despite having absolutely no training in anything and doing something physically impossible. And to further rub salt in the wound, the ""secret"" he's hiding... turns out to be a completely trivial thing, and there's no explanation as to why this was being hidden in the first place and why so much narrative focus was placed on it. Oh yeah, and this ""trivial thing"" was  red herring to hide some other plot point about a missing girl and the true situation behind that, which also ended up being nonsensical because the antagonists involved in said plot are strangely passionate about their craft, a detail the narrative never cares to address or convince you that this doesn't clash with the down-to-earth tone of this work.Overall, the anime is only worth watching for the opening and ending AMV's. Don't leave it to a single cour (or five fucking volumes of manga) to deliver a multi-layered plot with fleshed out characters and motivations without completely collapsing on itself."
Nige Jouzu no Wakagimi,"The Elusive Samurai has exceptional, unique direction. If you’re interested in unique animation styles, watch this. It is remiscent of Dororo and has a heavy historical and samurai feel to it with the BIG exception that it is also a comedy, and this is something I found deeply odd— if you like dark humor and intense violence, as well as pedophilia and mature behavior from children being protrayed in a largely lighthearted or satirical manner, possibly due to trauma… This may be for you.Regardless, I found this anime to be refreshing and innovative. The cruel nature of war and how it drives people mad...is still well-depicted in some ways. As someone that is not used to humor being portrayed in these scenarios, it took me by surprise. I believe this show will be enjoyed by those that value different and unique perspectives and reflections on history or human nature. The characters were rich in their expressions and motivations, but very mature for children (this is not new for anime, though). In some ways with the comey and the largely children cast, it has the vibe of a shonen (and it is labeled as one, however odd it may be for the R rating). The themes (re: thematic elements) are also mature and may not be fully appreciated or noticed by younger audiences. I do wanna emphasize the importance of a mature audience in order to fully enjoy all aspects of this show.The enemies are portrayed with heavy archetypes and stereotypes; animalistic traits such as big rat ears for good listeners, huge protruding eyes for one that can “see everything”, whiskers, big cheeks or lips, no eyes, even a drag queen and otherwise monstrous exaggerations that make them seem inhuman. One of the children characters, Kojiro, even says “The one with the rectangular features… the one with the focus lines over his eyes… Don’t just change appearance now, I can’t compare you to anything!”. Exaggerated expressions and actions from both enemies and protagonists are sometimes treated with comedic effect regardless of how cruel the action portrayed may be. One example of the humor is when a character known for eating a lot appears dead and then breaks the bleak atmosphere by saying “I’m so hungry I can’t move.” I don’t think that’s rare for anime but somehow feels significant to mention given the extreme and abrupt changes in tone.There is some CGI for those that hate seeing it at all. The element of historial accuracy is partially followed as shown by occasional dates, explanations of war tactics and customs such as depictions of religiosity and spirituality connected to Shintoism, Buddhism and the importance of Godlyness/ divinity/ Shrines/ Priests/ Seers/ Prayer at the time as well as female characters at times being left behind due to more dangerous conditions. There is a feeling that it is all a big play being performed as shown in how fun the ED is, with some characters even dressed in modern clothes.In summary, this show is uniquely directed with frequent changes in tone mostly about a group of mature, sometimes endearing kids fighting adult samurai with exaggerated features, occasional inspiring, introspective moments, childlike moments (they are still kids, after all) and comedy relief throughout."
Dead Dead Demons Dededede Destruction (OVA) Episode 0,"PROS: The story is ok!Pretty Asano art to look at.CONS: The animation is janky and awkward. The story is told with too much lazy exposition instead of showing us. The episode didn't sell me on the characters, and I thought the girls could be cuter? Oh and yay, another alcoholic manga author. Oh and he wakes up after a coma and there's zombies... I mean aliens. Not super original nor interesting. Also, it contains spoilers for the series, which wasn't obvious from the title and probably ruined it for me.I would skip this one and just read the manga to be honest. If you are...anime only, I would still skip."
Inferno Cop,"A truly unique mini-show featuring an undeniably cool and interesting main character, set against a backdrop of bizarre and unpredictable situations.It’s important to keep in mind that this series is highly experimental and (probably) had the budget equivalent to a few cups of coffee. But if you’re okay with that, you’ll find it absolutely delightful to watch.The art style—or rather, the animation—feels like they used Photoshop to transform still images of the characters, which adds to its quirky charm. On top of that, the majority of characters are voiced by the same VA, which somehow makes it even funnier.The plot isn’t particularly deep or complicated,...but that’s part of its appeal, also it surprises you in the best ways."
Inferno Cop,"The show covers a very funny script that makes a mix of unlikely situations with simple but well-made animation, in which the characters manage to make you laugh sincerely. It's like a Leslie Nielsen movie, but anime.Luluco and Inferno Cop's interactions throughout the anime are hilariously funny, and it could please a large part of the audience that watches the show. Inferno is an anime that makes you sit on the couch or chair without high expectations, and end up laugh and leave happy for having had a sincere laugh.Much better written and with more interesting content than MiguelAntilsu's reviews. Fun and enjoyable show!!!"
Uchuu Patrol Luluco,"There’s one word that perfectly captures this mini-show: goofy—in the best possible way. Considering each episode being about 6 minutes.Sure, the characters aren’t that deep, the plot is simple, and the budget seems low, but that’s exactly what makes this show so enjoyable. It embraces its silliness with confidence, delivering a lighthearted experience that’s perfect for unwinding after a long day.The fast-paced storytelling works to its advantage. Without the burden of a complex story or heavy lore, it’s incredibly easy to dive in and enjoy every moment. You don’t need to think too hard—just sit back and have fun.The episode featuring Inferno Cop is arguably...the most unique in the entire series.The characters, while simple, are undeniably charming. The main character is cute and somewhat relatable, and the side characters are there to fill in the rest."
Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"this is so bad, i felt obliged to write my first reviewthe special effects and the cinematic scenes is great, but the animation is simple. the character designs are generic, but the polish is good. it looks good enough as a whole with the slight thickness of character outlines, a stylistic choice similar to critically acclaimed Kimetsu no Yaiba. the side-characters' backstories have great potential. i personally enjoy op protagonists, and their contrast with mediocre side-characters, but both lead characters are way overpowered by birthright that it's lamethe antagonist is too overconfident and terrorizing to both of the lead characters for how powerless he is...despite losing face and getting his az kicked countless times, showing only rage, and neither sign of fear nor shame; they gave him the plot armor of a protagonist. his obsession with the female lead is also obnoxious and makes no sensethe female lead feels like she juggles personalities so abruptly like multiple ghosts possessing her and fighting over her body. it's also very unsettling to hear all the cheesy, cringe, somewhat flirty dialogues between a rather young girl even by medieval anime standards, and a male lead with an ""i can fix him"" mental fragility and the rationality of a man-child. both their personalities cater well to western ""modern audiences."" anyone who thought this was good should send an application to Ubislop.the ﻿plot is needlessly overcomplex, and even more so with the haphazard pacing and storytelling. ﻿it was hard to tell, but this is the worst thing i've ever seen in either shojo or reincarnation genre, and im just as stupid for taking 6 episodes to realize i was being baited something good was actually going to happen﻿﻿﻿this tried to cast such a wide net that it saved all the fish in the ocean by catching all the garbage"
"Ore wa Subete wo ""Parry"" suru: Gyaku Kanchigai no Sekai Saikyou wa Boukensha ni Naritai","They weren't kidding about the MC, 1 Episode in i loved the show then by Episode 4 I hated it. In only 4 episodes he's parried my curiosity into abject boredom!A good soundtrack, fluid animation with the surprise of quite lively side characters with seemingly thoughtful dialogue, what could go  wrong?Yup, we've got another decent prospect pauperized.The problems all start at the core of the experience. the loop of it' storytelling and the handling of the premise, the MC and last but not least the plot.My trick with knowing if a show is worth watching is to check the negative reviews(so you can dodge...Marinate1016's review)For about 4 episodes of an anime, quite a number of issues propped up for me, however due to my preliminary review i will only go over a few glaring ones that haven't been fleshed out by others.The writers might be confused about what to make a joke and what to make serious. The first 2 episodes go quite deeply into his past and it's all quite serious so you have an idea that the dialogue might generate some humor but the general tone will be sincere relying on good writing. To my dismay the gag they decided on is wholeheartedly repugnant. It's truly terrifying a revolving door of cliffhangers teasing a resolution but never delivering it.To give you an example of what i'm talking abnout.The MC watches a humanoid monster obliterate trained soldiers each time with a single swing of a human weapon. The MC doesn't know what monster it is so he calls it a cow and he’s being serious. (Not a bull and not bullshit either)  At first you will maybe think perhaps this is a joke, not a very funny one but nonetheless it's a joke right?But no,With the MC they've broken the record for clueless, it's borderline unwatchable. His ignorance is the bane of the show.With the plot they've made they've made the MC's cluelessness the crux. It excuses the author to commit heinous crimes, inspiring the kind of diabolical writing the likes of Rent-a-girlfriend produced.The premise?Well they almost seem to parry the premise.What about the side characters? are they written like real people who will slowly correct the MC's stupidity overtime creating healthy character development? Give it a guess....To continue on with the example i gave above, the premise leading on to the events of the MC's life make it impossible for him to make this kind of assessment about a monster. Not only that but for the experience to be satisfying we need this resolved. instead are left in total despondency, we never know if anyone will ever get him to understand the true nature of the monsters he faces and his relative strength.  This feedback loop is very essential to the plot and a staple of the story-telling needed to keep us interested.I don’t want to delve too much into details but he does a ridiculous amount of training and learning at adventurer academies. His entire build-up phase was spent training to be become an adventurer yet the basics of types of monsters, weapons and practices etc he just doesn't know. It's just utterly ridiculous. Compare this to last season's ""The Unwanted Undead Adventurer"" with another non-isekai fantasy MC  who similarly appears not so gifted till he died to receive his powers, but before his gift he had studied literally everything about the monsters in his area and also the surrounding areas learned all the theory in addition to training himself. ""The Unwanted Undead Adventurer"" very wisely displays what a realistic passionate individual would have done if they longed to enter such a dangerous profession. You can only train for so long every day, what do you do with the rest of the time especially if the only thing u can think about is your goal, you will buy or acquire books on adventuring, monsters, classes, spells, practices etc . You will ask seasoned adventurers about all of these things. However, in this show it's just a massive joke as he doesn't even know what a goblin is. What an immersion breaker! Another memorable moment is when he’s given a chance to become an adventurer(his lifelong goal) and just declines without even thinking, like a complete dunce.Don’t get me started on how in his pure nescient innocence he manages to procure a weapon as if hand-selected for him by God almighty. An exercise in crucifying any lingering enthusiasm for this “hero’s journey”.Another problem is, when you introduce a young, very attractive, female character, ensuing the classic damsel in distress routine resulting in a character so ridiculously besotted with the MC the end result is and must always be a sort of courtship. The writers induce this female into a role so pivotal to the chain of events that we are are all due some fan-service or sexual tension between them. I'm about 4 episodes in, and there's absolutely nothing, her obvious advances stonewalled for no plausible reason by the ludicrous bewilderment of the MC. Here's the problem, without the sexual relationship, or the shared affection, it is just makes the use of this character seem utterly amateur and almost insulting to our intelligence. No it’s not because I’m a depraved horndog, but rather it’s the concept of purposeful writing, once this type of character is introduced it must serve this purpose or it’s just terrible writing. As much as you pathetic simps and cucks like to pretend it's not the case, when an attractive virgin woman is introduced into the story of any series ever made it's a plot device and it's function is always certain to include a sexual one, if not then you've made a mistake and should have used a man instead. There's no way to be ""friends ""with such a woman in this situation. Especially when it's just those two alone together. They instead try to pass this girl off as an adventurer guide to the MC, how farcical.I think they took the “high-road” here, they decided the age-gap was “too wide”, in my opinion it’s sheer poppycock. This lack of confidence with such misplaced morality is what starves series like these of any substance or memorability.People cried about goblins raping women in Goblin slayer,(brilliant story telling) still one of the top watched shows each season it aired. People cried about Re-do of healer (a genuine masterpiece) a show so incredibly popular despite such average production value. They can never forget those experiences. They put on act and virtue signal professing to care about age-gaps and  ""Pedo"" but in the end we are all here to watch the fantasy experience. We are collectively apathetic about these so called ""issues"" intrinsically. Most of us want solid immersion and a decent story. Having a hot silver-haired female who is completely in adoration of the MC desperately following them around practically begging for a marriage. However nothing happens whilst we’re being forced to watch the absurdness of the MC's naiveté. It's just too much nonsense for us 100+ day anime guys.I've had enough of the clueless, omnibenevolent, apologizes for existing, bastard MC it boils my blood and the fatigue is kicking in.At this point It's not even cliche it’s just poor writing.ConclusionWe know how he wins every fight from the premise so there's barely any tension and a cap on how creative fights can be.So there's no interesting hero's journey because he's already too powerful.The side characters are going to perpetuate the stupidity as a massive gag, slowing the dialogue to a crawl.And there's no sexual relations between the foremost 2 characters even in a perfect setting to cultivate it because they fear the backlash.So there's nothing left for any of us seasoned fantasy watchers with a brain to be interested in.In only 4 episodes it's easy to predict where the remaining episodes will take us, and i don't want to be there.Preliminary Ratings.----------------------------------------------------------------Animation (4 episodes worth)8Sound7Plot2Characters-Story(side characters decent)5Enjoyment224/50 – 4.8/10 - 5/10 - Garbage.Let me be clear.I love Re-do of healer and I’m hoping they make an S2I loved Mushoku's double wife twist,I loved “Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World” despite the adaptation being mediocre outside of the fanservice.We all love a crazy fantasy but don't waste our time with these fake, duplicitous perplexities to sanitize the experience. With these types of adventures sometimes It’s better to be dangerous than boring.Alas I’ve only watched 4 episodes, Maybe I’m wrong, It’s possible that instead of steering the ship away from disaster they managed to get the MC on the foredeck  of the ship and he parries the iceberg that would have sank the titanic.I went in with a right hook, the MC parried, and now I've been knocked out.I've had enough of this joke.Hope this helps."
Hell Target,"Hell Target is a B-movie horror OVA that is an odd mixture of Alien, The Thing, and Solaris, with a bleak cosmic horror ending. There's often an eye-roll-inducing debate when it comes to horror, whether to show the monster or not. Well, it depends. Showing or not showing has a different impact and neither is necessarily better, but not showing tends to be better when you have limited resources because showing can look laughable, which is actually the case for a few parts in Hell Target. The dream sequence in the beginning is decently effective for its silhouette and composition-based abstraction. one of the first...deaths comes from some kind of large canine or feline creature, and the scene looks cheesy, and we would have benefited from not showing at this point. Usually the first few deaths, it's better to maintain suspense as to what exactly we're dealing with. Of course, HT has the advantage over a lot of horror that its entity is effectively formless, much like Solaris and The Thing. The former constitutes a purely psychological, perhaps even spiritual, horror, drawing from the fears, dreams, and ambitions of the mind, though the entity or force in question is not strictly good, evil, or even hostile. The latter is more materialistic in the way it is conceived and how the monster will incorporate various creatures into its body for all kinds of strange, twisted special effects.The translation is clearly poor at a few parts, with one part in particular not making sense; there are two different translations I've seen, but both are quite similar at this part, leading me to believe the problem might be in the original script, but who knows? Something about telepathy and ""They use brainwaves to create a virtual image, to confuse and kill us."" How do they know this to be true? There doesn't seem to be much info at all to work with. And if that's true, how do they see the ""virtual image"" on the camera? Shouldn't it be something only the person affected sees? The cameras aren't directly connected to their brains. I wouldn't say this is a spoiler, and it's probably best going into this title understanding the kind of horror it is; incidentally, the synopsis on here hilariously reveals that everyone dies except the (sort of) MC and that his mission is to kill the entity before a third ship arrives.What this title actually is is a psychological horror, where the thoughts of the characters affect the form of whatever entity (or entities) is roaming around the planet. Perhaps it's not even so much an entity as something pertaining to the atmosphere and nature of the planet itself. There is one scene where the entity takes a form, seemingly without the input of any human, but even that might have been from the character patrolling the hallways at the time, but it's somewhat questionable as to whether every person would see something different pertaining to their psychology, so I think a better, more coherent choice would be to create a little bit more mystery, removing the first death from being recorded on the camera and not showing that scene I referenced above.The atmosphere in HT is quite strong, and the animation is surprisingly decent, given that so many people will simply say it's dated and bad. Not much of it is exceptional, but I was surprised to find that the aesthetic mostly worked out, and there was more enjoyment to be had than one solid explosion scene from the great Toshiaki Hontani. The valkyrie scene and several others were also decently animated, and there was rarely anything so poorly done from an art and animation standpoint as to elicit laughter, other than the slideshow animation of the ""bird deity."" There's even some okay background animation and simulated camera movements here and there. True to it's B-horror form, there are lots of cool gorey death scenes, a fairly bare bones, no-nonsense script, but punctuated by out of place scenes, such as one guy saying, ""I hope I'll get a chance to take a piss before I die,"" or a couple suddenly ending up in bed, having sex in a pastel soft-focus scene with shojo sparkles, and sweet talking each other, right in the middle of the crew being massacred and a bloodthirsty entity wandering around. Enhancing the grimy feel of the OVA is the horrendous quality, with the production both greatly needing a remaster and perhaps being better for the lack of it, with everything a bit fuzzy and grainy, adding to the disorientation of the often crimson-monochrome and Martain-like hell scape they inhabit, along with numerous shaky closeups when they are running from or firing at the entity, the occasional out of focus shot, characters swallowed by the outer darkness, scenes lit by only harsh flashlight beams, and many minimalist composition choices. It actually doesn't look bad, with maybe the main detractor being fairly generic human character design and the various forms the entity takes maybe being too out there in some cases or not having a disturbing enough design.What comes across as actually a fairly average film is most burdened by a painfully dull cast. Most of these characters don't even register as distinct archetypes, have few lines of dialogue, have no development, and hardly any characterization. The problem with this being a psychological horror is that you kind of need characters that resemble something above a husk for decent psychological elements. We have to known something about these characters and what makes them who they are. I don't remember any important information from the dialogue. We know a few people by their role, such as the captain and doctor. One guy is a flirt. One girl has a crush on a guy. The most Nordic-looking cast member sees the entity as a Valkyrie. Another character sees it as a ""bird deity,"" probably in reference to Amerindian religion. Apparently, the MC is afraid of spiders. There's even a missed opportunity where one of the girls is being carried by the entity, and one might think the man who desires her might influence the entity in this respect, but he is not involved with the scene at all. The only effective toying with psychological states would be during the ending, when the MC sees something he shouldn't, and during a lengthy flashback scene for one of the characters. This flashback is intriguing but ultimately lacking enough context to be especially meaningful, serving to do nothing other than to confirm that the entity knows your every thought and can conform itself to match what will haunt you. Yet the scene is a fine example of what the film should strive to work with—memory and internal states—but seldom exploits it to any real depth. What made Alien thrive is that the characters were given more room to be distinguished, had firmer archetypes, better character writing, and the film was a decent length to explore characters and themes, running at 1 hour and 57 minutes, whereas we barely get even 50 minutes with our hollow cast in Hell Target."
Kidou Senshi Gundam ZZ,"This is not nearly as bad as everyone says it is. Yes, the comedy does throw you off, especially after the kick to the balls that was the zeta ending, but the life the comedy gives to the main cast (especially bright, who works best in comedy!) is crucial for establishing the new crew after zeta. Best overall cast out of the first four gundam stories.Judau and his relationship with his sister(s) is the core of the series and is very very good. He's such a likeable protag, I can't help but root for him. Haman Karn is also so fucking good. Queen of...a kingdom of ashes. Shes so good. Fa and Kamille's stuff was also very good, very cathartic. The dublin arc is great. I'm not too happy with Bright seemingly getting a lobotomy between the ending of zeta and zz, but i cant be too mad at him since his show switched target audiences.The supporting cast was also super great. Chara Soon and mash were fantastically funny, I was so sad that Tomino had to undo their lobotomies in order to fit with the more serious portions of the later half.The overall plot and themes were... okay, but i feel like i just didnt get everything so im not holding the showrunners to that.Overall, highly recommend, don't skip zz!!"
Kidou Senshi Zeta Gundam,"Zeta has a lot of high highs and a lot of low lows. The writing peaks and dips dramatically based on if there's a woman in a scene or not. The writing isn't bad per say, it's actually extremely good, it's just that I don't think Tomino knew how women worked when he was writing this. Free my girl Reccoa she didnt do anything wrong.Great action, animation. Suits look cool.Kamille is a very good protagonist, and watching his journey is harrowing. Four Vaginas is also like so fucking cool, like unreasonably fucking cool, but he's still an asshole dipshit and I appreciate that. Haman...was fantastically menacing, even if she didnt show up a lot.The cast overall is fine. I wish I got to see them interact more as a team, but I'm fairly happy with what we got. They're not beating the charm of WB though. Speaking of charm, the returning white base cast got very good sendoffs, Kai and Amuro especially.Poor Bel. She deserved better, but I didn't hate her arc.While I have mixed feelings because of the misogny, I do recommend zeta as a whole, because it's a great show, just didnt hit all the buttons for me in particular.Oh, and Fa Yuiry best girl."
Kidou Senshi Gundam,"This series has so much heart. From the very human antagonists, to the acknowledged evil of child soldiers, to the genuinely revolutionary action sequences— fantastic.Amuro's arc is great and the best thing about it. His rivalry with Char is legendary for a reason. Their relationship is very good, and watching them both start to crack under the pressure is awesome.The white base crew is very good too, they're very charming and bounce off of each other nicely. I wish we got to see more of them interacting rather than random zeon baddies every week.There is a fair bit of misogyny, but it’s...classic 80s misogyny, which I find much preferable than the fan service misogyny of anime today."
Kidou Senshi Gundam: Senkou no Hathaway,"I mean it's alright. Watching Hathaway compared from CCA to now was interesting. seeing his demeanor switch after experiencing char and amuros divorce movie was nice. hathaway is the best part of the movie, but unfortunately that's not saying a lot. the action is ok. most of it takes place in the pitch black night so i cant see shit. the choreo isnt too memorable either. this movie just felt like a whole bunch of set up to the sequels. cant say it was terrible, but DO NOT let it be your first foray into gundam. also, had a hard time grasping what made gigi...tic, but ill chock that up to my own stupidity. I would like to see where this story goes next, if that means anything."
Blue Lock vs. U-20 Japan,"To those complaining about Blue Lock U-20 being dogwater and then blaming the animation team please rethink who the actual culprits are. I'm not disagreeing that the animation is all PNG and PowerPointes but just understand that the reason this happened is due moreso to the production committee and the higher ups not giving the animators enough time and money to make this season amazing like it should of been. I can tell the animators are skilled and know what they are doing but it's clear to see they couldn't put any effort into making this season as good as in the manga.Overall however this...season is still trash and I hope this enlightens people to realize that this is all a business to the producers and production committee and they couldn't give a rat's arse about the fans but the money that comes in.I have no idea how making a worse season would garner more money. Heck we're not even halfway through the manga and more seasons is possible but I doubt the fans, including me, will stick around after this atrocity. Business tactics 101 (how to not business tactics and throw a studio's reputation under the bus (8-bit)) big yikes :("
Ingress the Animation,"*No spoilers*This review is for the anime, Ingress the Animation, and does not reference the Ingress mobile game.SummaryIngress the Animation is an anime series based off a mobile game called Ingress. This adaptation follows Makoto Midorikawa, a rookie, and other characters such as Sara Coppola and Jack Norman, as they traverse a battle between corporations and factions. This story incorporates the fantasy power of Exotic Matter (XM) to supply special abilities as chaos ensues. Ingress the Animation follows the same tropes as other action and fantasy tales, and it does so with mediocrity. If you enjoy action, this may be interesting; however, the story and...characters are unexceptional at best, and the overall quality of this anime is below-average.Story: 5/10The story of Ingress the Animation is one of the most average and mediocre imaginable. There is some action and adventure, but the emphasis on the plot and disregard for developing characters is a huge setback. Basically, there’s a mysterious substance, like a radio wave, called Exotic Matter. Two factions form over time to battle for power. There is some secrecy, suspense, and lots of action. Overall, there’s nothing special about the series’ story, but there’s also nothing terrible. Unfortunately, the emphasis on “stuff happening” without explanation, and the sudden changes in plot points does make it hard to follow at times. There are some interesting plot twists, but there are also major plot armor scenes and significant conveniences for the characters. There really aren’t any high stakes. The story also doesn’t explore deep or meaningful themes. It’s just intended for action and entertainment. That’s not necessarily bad, but it does limit the meaning behind the story. In summary, the story is average.Characters: 3/10The characters are forgettable and as generic as possible. They are barely introduced, never mind developed, and the entire series revolves around action with minimal room for them to make decisions. The writers left too many plot conveniences for the characters to grow or even feel touchable. This left the high stakes out of the picture and detracted from the meaning of the series in the first place. I always watch a series or movie twice before reviewing, and I can honestly say that Makoto Midorikawa, Sara Coppola, and Jack Norman are the most forgettable characters in any media I have experienced. I didn’t remember their characteristics within a few weeks of watching. Overall, the characters are poorly written and uninteresting.Art: 6/10The CGI is sufficiently decent. It isn’t breathtaking but still an overall strength of the anime.Sound: 6/10The soundtrack is slightly above average. Alt-J is just too cool to pass on. With that said, even the English dub is average and passable. It’s not the voice actors’ fault that the writing and dialogue are poor.Enjoyment: 4/10Total score: 4.8/10 (low-average)"
Dandadan,"Last year, I read 3 volumes of Dandadan, covering what's been shown in the anime so far. I wasn't very impressed; the content of the manga bored me, and I ended up dropping it.Today, Dandadan has begun airing as an anime. Remembering how overrated I thought the manga originally was, I decided to give the anime a shot with all the hype surrounding it... and, well—I'm actually enjoying the show quite a lot. This is truly a testament to the great heights an animated adaptation can reach; a medium that combines movement, colour, sound, and music in ways no manga can, no matter how nice...the story and art are. Excited to see more."
Blue Lock vs. U-20 Japan,"Initially I wasn't going to watch season 2 (let alone write a review on mal about it), but after seeing all the complaints and memes on Tiktok I couldn't not watch it.Lets get one thing straight from the beginning; my opinion isn't anything new. The animation is practically non existent. It's like the team spent all their budget on the artwork and forgot about the animation. Yeah sure, there's some cool effects here and there but it does not save it at all. It's like when you watch one of those really bad edits where the creator goes overkill on the effects, but the...edit is still god awful. Blue Lock S2 is like that just with better quality and a team behind it. They have some idea though that not every scene can be a still frame with a moving mouth and that the characters have to run around on the field sometimes. So what do they do? Nah not animate it! Use CGI! and my god it looks horrible. I can't help but cackle whenever I see these Roblox looking characters run across the field.The story? Still the same thing as last season but the animation would put most people off. I don't see a lot of people who are captivated by sports anime for the sports itself, just the banger animations otherwise we'd be with the bros watching the NBA instead.Overall, PowerPoints my science teacher makes have more movement to them. Is this season worth watching if you didn't like season 1? no. Is this season worth watching if you loved season 1? no. Is this season worth watching if you want something to laugh at? probably, but there are better things to do with your time. Also, to all studios present and emerging please take this as a learning opportunity to not be like the Blue Lock team."
Tunshi Xingkong,"Tunshi Xingkong / Swallowed Star is a Chinese production. It has a basic enough storyline: there is a post-apocalyptic world, our use of atomic bombs created monsters, there are superlative warriors fighting against these monsters, and there are good and bad people alike within the warrior cast as well. The main character is the son of a low-earning family and wants to improve his family's fortunes by becoming a warrior, and his main rival, the boy who wanted to bully him and yet didn't have the power for the said bullying, tries very hard to make him pay for a small humiliation that leads to...lots of elaborate and extremely lawless schemes.Now, I have very mixed feelings for this show. Firstly, many people like the great visuals, but for me, 4K or whatever, they look like the forced animation of video games' video stories. You can see every single hair in one's head, but they cannot walk properly, so that's not my cup of tea. Secondly, the storyline, poor lad attempted to be tormented by the rich jerk is too outdated and too unnecessary. Still, the in-military-squad relations, the camaraderie of the group members, the family's love for their son who can improve their fortunes, the love story that is there but for no great reason (its origin is related to her worrying about him due to bullying attempts) are all positive sides to this series, in addition to great monster fights and alright schemes. I am not a great fun of its musical score, either.What bothers me the most, though, is the fact that the episodes are extremely short. I am saying that as a man used to the 22 minutes episodes with 1 1/2 minute songs at the beginning and end of an anime show. Swallowed Star starts the new episode only at 2 minutes 52 seconds mark, has a very lengthy scene divider at the middle (possibly longer than 45 seconds, didn't time it), and, it stops at the 19 minutes mark, making the episodes just about 15 minutes in length which is, to be honest, ridiculous.As a result, we have a show which is alright to watch but I wouldn't miss if I hadn't watched it for a year. I don't understand the people voting in MAL, either as this show has a superlative rating but better-scripted, better organized Arifureta has far, far lower ratings. At the end, I cannae tell anyone to not watch it, but I can't recommend it wholeheartedly, either. It is the perfect ""mixed feelings"" animated series for me."
Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann,"If you consider yourself an anime fan, you'll probably like this. But if you're like me and think that 90% of anime produced is unwatchable garbage, this will probably bore you out of your mind—at least the first half will. The second half is a bit more engaging, but as a whole, this show is just a bunch of uninspired tropes. Not a single character is unique or interesting; they're all the most basic anime stereotypes imaginable. The plot is kinda interesting? But the show spends way too much time introducing me to characters I don't care about, which drags on the story to the...point that I'm uninterested in what is happening, especially in the first half.This is a Mecha show, so I assume that the appeal for most people watching this is the Mecha fights, but I found them unbelievably boring to watch. The choreography is practically nonexistent, and the end result of every battle is predictable after episode one. The animation is technically impressive, but the choreography isn't appealing or interesting to look at, and none of the characters are compelling enough for me to have any emotional stake in the outcome of any battle. Also, the fights just don't seem real. It doesn't feel like a giant robot is punching and shooting lasers; it instead feels like I'm watching someone play with action figures. There's no gravity or power behind anything happening. The only fight where this was done well (and the only fight in the show that I actually liked) was in episode 3, and it wasn’t even a Mecha fight.At the end of the day, this is one of the most boring and generic anime I've ever seen. How far Gainax has fallen. You'll like this if you watch shows like ""Reincarnated in another world with my girlfriend but I'm level 100000 and she's my pet"" or some shit. Though I can't recommend it because of the gross fan service. Leave it to Japan to degrade and objectify women."
Sora yori mo Tooi Basho,"As someone who is most likely to dislike the ""Cute Girls doing cute things"" pseudo-genre, I was intrigued by the simplicity of what this show is trying to achieve. By the end of the series, I was impressed by how well they actually managed to pull it off and transition to the epilogue (some of the parts feel rushed, hence it can be a turn-off for others).  The objective of the show is to teach you that (as I interpreted it) ""a determined soul can do everything"" (also present in Albert Camus's book, ""The Myth of Sisyphus"") through what may sound to many, a...stupid objective, to go to Antarctica.The story is simple to follow, as it's just the journey of the high school girls, with the goal of making it to Antarctica. It shows their hardships, from getting the money required to go to such a place to emotional struggles, and also the physical ones, it's not an easy dream to achieve, as every dream ought to be.  The characters are well-made, they are easy to like and attach to, nothing surprising, the only nitpick is that they are not special in any way compared to the rest of the characters present in this type of anime, as someone who seeks perfection in everything, it comes to me as a disadvantage, but a regular person probably won't even notice.Of course, we are talking about a modern show, the animation is on point, the sounds and voice acting are excellent, the opening and the ending of each episode are on point, nothing to cry about.  Also, this is one of the few anime that tells the whole story in 13 episodes, with no more movies, or special episodes, if you are in for a trip, I highly recommend this title. (I welcome any feedback for this review)."
One Piece Fan Letter,"I hate that I'm a One Piece fan.The big arcs, the big backstories, the characters. There's always something that destroys me with One Piece, and I thought this was just a simple little thing. A fun episode, with great animation, and a great little plot. Like a short-film about the world, but even this little thing can get me crying. 20 minutes, that's all it took.We don't follow the original crew on this one, but the public perception on their biggest moment. Instead of a grand fight, or a grand moment, we just get people, and how from their simple, and outside outlook...their lives changed. There's something about Luffy, a hotheaded kid, with an earnest desire to save the ones he loves against unsurmountable odds, which inspired a soldier, to save his brother. Something in Nami, a smart, non-powered human, changing the world with pure wit and tools, which inspires a little girl to change the world.Each character has that little something, which echoes throughout the world. Their efforts aren't meaningless, their efforts change lives, and motivate those around them. It makes their story not only being important to us, but important for the world around them. They save lives, not only with the actions they take, but with those who look at such actions.It's so fresh, seeing a positive chain reaction of pure hope. We always get the cycle of violence, the cycle of sadness, and despair. Not many times we get something so hopeful, that makes the world a better place by simply happening. It made me cry not from the tragedy of it all but from happiness. Not a good deal of anime cause that, and One Piece can certainly focus a lot more on the tragedy, but that's exactly what makes this so perfect.So many tragedies, so much horror in that particular world. For once, we get the glimmer of hope. These people, small, or big, old or young, all of them can change the world, piece by piece, action by action.Brilliant animation, brilliant characters, and an unmatched fast pacing that tells everything so fast, and so effectively. It was perfect. A perfect piece of One Piece.10/10. We need more overwhelmingly happy moments like this."
Yofukashi no Uta,"Dropping this series was mistake.Only realized that two years after it's releasehow brilliantly predictible this anime  can be is genuinenly suprisingNot to mention visuals.They are straight wallpaper grade.Just in fact i am using ep1 min 0:10 as wallpaper.Screen capture then set as a wallpaper.DONE! it's great.Since visuals is so great.It is worth the effort to find bd release.I advise buying locally but if you cannot find it nyaa.si is good source for those.Another strenght of this anime is that,There is no ""filler episodes"" or unfun episodes.Straight shooter.If you dropped this series just like i did.Give it a another chance.It deserves it."
"""Oshi no Ko"" 2nd Season","There are loads to talk about in this season, but overall, we know it's superb.Many others will tell you the hype is extremely unfounded, but even after everything, I had a great experience watching it week by week. We managed to focus way more on the industry, and how that affects your perception of life, as well as the effort you put into something. The tribulations of acting, specially how your personal life can shape your character, and the hit on your mental health. It's riveting, extremely entertaining, and watching it with another layer in terms of adaptation was great.The whole manga adaptation...problem, and the characters that come from that part of the series, felt like it didn't waste any second or old character in the mix. We get a return of the author from the TV drama from the first season, the MC from that drama coming back to tell us about being mediocre, and how you can shape up to be better. The murder mystery coming back to haunt us, and the ending changing so much of what we knew.It's a great season, with incredible plot advancements, while characters are flipping into going back to their terrible mindsets, or moving forwards with their lives. I loved it.Any criticisms I have, come from the final episodes, which drag just a bit more than they should. In the play, some moments were too exaggerated, even if, yes, it tried to convey emotion with pure visuals, and I applaud it for it, but it didn't stick its landing as well.There aren't big problems, just small ones that take me out. It's as if everything just came out perfect, with no change in status. People achieved everything, and I don't know if that was the right move. Something's missing, but maybe that's the point. We wrapped that plot-point, hence the third season's about the murder mystery.I just don't know. It did wrap a big arc, which I like, while setting up the next big thing.8/10. Not perfect, but damn, it's good."
Isekai Shikkaku,"Isekai parody stories, much like isekai reincarnation stories themselves, are very hit-or-miss with me. I’m a fan of Isekai Ojisan, for example, but Konosuba didn’t really appeal to me at all despite its mainstream popularity. Isekai Shikkaku is another such isekai parody manga series adaptation from AtelierPontdarc, the studio best known for adapting Isekai Ojisan. However, despite coming from the same studio, the same director, and having a somewhat similar brand of humor, I feel that Isekai Shikkaku has some fatal flaws that prevent it from hitting the same way as Ojisan.This series follows the adventures of real-life writer Osamu Dazai (whose work I’ve unfortunately...never gotten around to reading although I hope to someday) whose suicide attempt is interrupted by a runaway truck. Like all those who are flattened by this legendary truck, our Senpai is transported to another world; the twist is that he is having absolutely none of this world’s high fantasy shenanigans and just wishes everyone would let him kill himself in peace. Despite Senpai’s determination to die and for reasons I don’t fully understand, he just seems to be immune to death in this world.Forced to continue living, Senpai travels around the world searching for his lover “Sacchan”, so that they may commit suicide together, with some fantasy world friends he meets along the way. Together they end up in conflict not with a dark lord and the forces of evil, but with other isekai’d would-be-protagonists who are using their special abilities to terrorize this world’s NPC denizens. As it turns out, Senpai is the ideal foe for these power-tripping tyrants as he uses his writer’s insight to deconstruct and lay bare all those unlucky enough to cross his path.I took to this series' premise right away and I felt that Senpai was a really fun protagonist in a very Addams Family sort of way, although I have my doubts over how reminiscent he is of the real-life Dazai. The first half-or-so of the series was one that I looked forward to watching on air but soon enough I found myself completely bored and having to rewatch episodes I fell asleep watching. Like Isekai Ojisan, this is a series that enjoys making fun of JRPG/Light Novel tropes but unlike Isekai Ojisan it forgets to give you a reason to fall back in love with the genre it's parodying and this ends up becoming the series’ fatal flaw.Let’s compare, for example, how this series and how Isekai Ojisan deal with female characters and fan-service as both Ojisan and Shikkaku parody the trope of fantasy world characters being unrealistically beautiful. In Ojisan this becomes a major plot point of the story as it leads to Ojisan being hunted down and persecuted as a supposed orc; in Shikkaku it mainly leads to female characters having huge boobs and revealing clothes. Despite this limited focus, Shikkaku doesn’t actually contain much in the way of fan-service giving the impression that the author is merely making fun of the sexualization found in Japanese fantasy without contributing to it. Meanwhile, Isekai Ojisan fully embraces fan-service and fills its story with beautiful girls in pervy situations. In other words, true to its title, Shikkaku (to be unfit for) is merely “making fun” of isekais rather than embracing the genre and too often the result is a mean-spirited story with boring characters in boring situations (although I did enjoy the first few episodes)."
Meikyuu Black Company,"An isekai anime different from other isekai series, it has a unique sense of humor and is filled with characters with strange personalities, especially Ninomiya. I will particularly remember the moment when Rim was about to eat a man's head, and Ninomiya placed a wing in her mouth, transforming Rim from a monstrous state into a cute girl happily eating a wing, as well as Ninomiya's personal yandere gun.An isekai anime different from other isekai series, it has a unique sense of humor and is filled with characters with strange personalities, especially Ninomiya.

I wouldn't even bother to write a review or Yaps if the anime itself were tagged as: Comedy , apparently this is not even a comedy genre anime also reviewing ain't...my tea either~ even if it is a comedy, their jokes are still stank cold frozen shit!This is another typical Fantasy Adventurous anime where the MC is crazily overly superpowered living monastic life with the very best legendary teachers in that very universe and train train train rigorously strictly with all those Masters every single day , we already now next result is and YES OUR MC IS SUPER JACKED, SUPER-OPPED AND BUFF but somehow in the society where Ability is important and there's literally an Magic/Adventure Guild institution in this very anime universe that have all the facilities and whole complete organization , board members but somehow THEY ALL STILL MISS our MC capability and strength??Oh no! that one scene where our MC had to demonstrates his FULL power in order to pass Magic/Adventure school test???

Legend of Regios,"I love this so much.It was genuinely so beautiful, everything about it was amazing.This gave such a feeling of melancholy because it reminds me of all the older animes, especially the video game anime adaptations.The main character definitely reminds me of Dante, not just because of the weapon style, but also personality wise.This is something I wish everyone could see.The style is definitely rare nowadays but considering it was made in 2009 it makes sense.Everything about it follows other themes that we have seen in other great stories, but it also keeps it unique.I love it."
Dandadan,As a manga reader I already knew that this show is going to blow up.Starting few episodes were fun with great animation and great dynamic between our main cast.It reminds me a lot of Opm and Mob psycho in some ways but it's the episode 7 which exceeded all of my expectation with such a beautiful transition between real life and back story and life like fluid animation.This show literally hits you.It's very rare when you see an anime that improves upon the manga but Science Saru has done it with their adaption.Definately the best episode I have seen in years.
Gakkou no Kaidan,"Most people 22 years ago would have claimed that shows like; Evangelion, Gundam Wing, Cowboy Bebop, Dragonball Z, or Sailor Moon were their ""gateway"" Anime. For me, it was the subtitled version of Ghost Stories. My school had a Japan Club that played Anime near weekly and this was the first. Only saw the first 2 episodes (and coincidentally I wouldn't see the rest of the Anime until years later) but I was completely hooked.The dub for this show is much more famous and easier on average for a Western audience to digest. That is if you go into it keeping a politically correct...mindset outside your brain. It's basically a different show than what Japan made. The subtitled version likely has very few fans besides myself. The only other ones I know of are my wife and Chris Beveridge of the long dead animeondvd.com site.I can't speak for the dub, but the sub is fine. It's an average C-tier Anime."
Horimiya,"This anime gave me depression, because it made me feel jealous of the relationship that the characters had with each other.But in all seriousness, I liked Horimiya, not only for the cute depictions of romance and daily life. Not only for its heartfelt themes coupled with its slapstick comedy. But also for its depiction of the main character's struggles mental jails.We all struggle with our own problems, and sometimes feel like there's no point in continuing, but Horimiya shows that maybe we should hang in there, whether fate exists or not, we never know where life will take us tomorrow, taking us closer to the...fate we desire. Maybe we will find someone who gets happy for us, sad for us, angry for us. Maybe we will find someone we would want to live for, to protect. Maybe we will finally be able to look at old-selves in the eyes. And maybe.... we'll find someone to gift our sky to."
Undead Unluck,"""Bro, Undead Unluck is actually really funny you just have to watch it bro, please bro believe me. you have to understand the complex humor, bro how are you not laughing he groped a woman for the 500th time please bro it gets better at chapter 150 I promise it's so funny bro""Need I say anything else? Shounen manga aimed at 13 year olds aren't exactly a ""slow burn"" sort of series. It's pretty blatantly clear the themes of the show, even if there is a so called ""dramatic plot twist"" at chapter 990. It's honestly a bit laughable to see people thinking that the...romance in this show is realistic or something. Hell yeah bro just ignore like the entire first 500 chapters or something and then it gets better. If the foundations are shaky, then  how can the rest be good?I think giving slow pace shows with a lot of dialogue, setup, story, and character development makes sense. Something like Shinsekai Yori. In this show you're just fighting people with superpowers. It really is just super bad version of Jojo. It's got nearly identical concepts in terms of powers and fighting, but rather than our main character just figuring out the enemy's weakness because there's actually some more thought put into the story, they're just dumb as bricks. You can't actually be serious about how dumb some of the antogonists or enemies in the story are utilizing their absolutely broken and OP powers but because it's a dumbed down shounen manga somehow our MC is the only person that's able to abuse mechanics on how powers work. It's pretty apparent that the only reason why fights pan out the way they do is due to plot armor."
Dandadan,"Although the hype is unfounded, the first 3 episodes are not as good as the following ones, they serve as a generic comical and maybe sexualized intro for what the anime is turning into slowly. The characters have their own quirks and the art style although it might seem generic to some people, it's quite literally what the manga is so i don't understand why people are complaining about that.The story might be as generic as many can think about as it's just random notes that the manga author smashed together into a single piece giving what dandadan is today, having said that, it's...not that generic at some points, giving some backstory to secondary characters and giving a plot twist noone expected.also, don't think that Okarun, one of the main characters, is going to be strong on its own, he's pretty socially stupid/awkward and might not be the typical protagonist.you might not or might like this, it depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking for an anime with an interesting story that makes no sense and at some points might be too generic, but on other points might make you cry (either by sadness or laughting) this might be the anime you've been looking for."
Yakusoku no Neverland 2nd Season,"ENG: Total disappointment, the only good thing are the first two episodes, those are the ones who use the manga story. They just grabbed the original story and destroyed it, I wouldnt complain if they were good, but it's hateful. A big sh*t, deserves nothing. They have totally ruined this anime, they have grabbed the manga, ripped off the paper sheets and proceed to clean their b*ts with them. It does not deserve even a try, average animation, horrible story.Impossible to recommend, better to pretend it doesn't exist and wait for a TPN Brotherhood.ESP: Decepción total, lo único bueno son los dos primeros capítulos, que...son los fieles al manga. Se han pasado la historia original por el forro, y si fuera buena la nueva, pues igual no me quejaba, pero es que es aborrecible. Una c*gada enorme, no merece nada.Han arruinado totalmente lo bueno de este anime, han cogido el manga, han arrancado las hojas y se han limpiado el c*lo con ellas. No merece la pena ni siquiera pensar en verlo, la animación es promedio y la historia es vomitiva.Imposible recomendarla, mejor hacer como que no existe y esperar un TPN Brotherhood."
Blue Lock vs. U-20 Japan,"I don't do mid-season reviews, but sometimes you run into a series you just can't finish and this is one of those times. Seven episodes was too many.This is painful. I'm a big fan of the manga and I remember some of these scenes well. They stood out in the manga for just how hype and fast-paced they were. Now... they're just drained of everything. The pacing is weird, the shots range from bad to OK, and even when things do look pretty decent, I just can't help feeling like I'd rather just re-read these chapters. It would be one thing if they could manage...decent CGI and compositing, but they can't, and so much of the actual 2D animation remains just keyframes. Considering how pivotal these events are supposed to be and the investment we're supposed to have in these characters, my lack of interest is just making watching this week after week feel like a chore. It's a shame to watch a series this strong get so poorly adapted."
Blue Lock vs. U-20 Japan,"Why is there such a bandwagon of hate for the second season of this show? Genuinely it is an absolute thrill to watch and I look forward to each new episode that is released.I'll admit that I haven't read the manga yet, so I can't speak to whether or not it is faithful to the source material, but everyone needs to calm down and stop submitting such negative reviews before the season is even halfway over.The animation quality is quite good, and if you disagree, then feel free to go watch another show that meets your expectations. It's score was already down to like 6.5/10...before the third episode was out. There really is no reason you need to rate the show so poorly for the quality of animation that is nowhere near as problematic as it's been exaggerated to be."
Iya na Kao sare nagara Opantsu Misete Moraitai ver 3.0,"The title gives it away, no baits here for it's exactly what it promotes, a girl showing her underwear while showing a disgusted face towards us, the audience, the horny viewers who love seeing that.One interesting thing about it is that there are 7 versions with 7 different VAs, I personally enjoyed the Kuwahara Yuki version. No male character can be seen or heard for your information.It can be watched as single entry, there are 2 other seasons made by the same studio in the same manner, if you watched those first you know what to expect.It also has a fun ending theme, so be...sure to listen to it.I recommend it to all perverts who want to ogle a cute military girl showing her panties with a disgusted look."
Dandadan,"A true masterpiece.This is peak fiction .Anime was medium with lot of potential But no anime I watched have ever tipped in what could be achieved by simple things.Currently when this is airing there are lot of other anime which shadowing this masterpiece.But believe this will blow your mind.Okay here is the checklist that some of you are looking for.*Story-shounen style with good pacing chara growth.But has unique concept.Also very unpredictable.*Video quality & animeation-banger the art style is doing justice to the manga whilest improving alot than the manga by adding extra scenes.Characters-very well written chara goofy most of the times.*Sound & music-brings a whole...dimension to the story telling absolute bestDrama & romance-shonen style typicalHorror-Hidden with humorComedy-greatPeople who don't like it are haters that's all.If you are a unbiased guy with common sense,watch it.No cap this made me cry.You wouldnt expect it."
Josee to Tora to Sakana-tachi,"For some reason, I was sure I would cry, but I didn't, but I still thought it was a wonderful movie. Its art is beautiful, its story is beautiful, and its message is beautiful. It was definitely an incredible experience.The anime follows Tsuneo, a biology student who dreams of studying in Mexico. In order to earn money, he ends up working for an elderly woman, helping a girl in a wheelchair who calls herself Josee. As the story progresses, Tsuneo begins to understand Josee's troubled thoughts and, as a result, becomes more interested in her.At first, I have to admit that I was irritated by...Josee and her stubbornness, but after a while I felt ashamed of my selfishness. She was right when she said that ""healthy people don't understand"", because, even though we try to understand, we will never fully understand without being in that situation. When I finished watching the anime, I was desperate to understand more about the other versions of this same story, and, in my opinion, this is one of the best versions, and with a good ending lol. The art is also impeccable, unique and wonderful. I hope to see more works similar to these.~Nine <3"
"Hazurewaku no ""Joutai Ijou Skill"" de Saikyou ni Natta Ore ga Subete wo Juurin suru made","There's some interesting things hinted at in terms of the larger scales of the plot which builds intrigue but it's not enough to make up for the lack of thought in other places.The MC is portrayed to be edgy, anti-hero but the plot never gives him the chance to make questionable moral decisions that cause conflict.Every bad guy he meets name or unnamed somehow always declares themselves to be sexual assaulters so when thr MC defeats them, the audience feels no remorse. It simply makes the plot feel empty and makes it seem like MC is a cursed being that makes every antagonist he meets...become a sexual assaulter."
Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan (2023),"This will be my longest yet review so buckle up!The early arcs show some potential with interesting villains and high-stakes battles, but as the series progresses, the plot tends to meander. The villains, while charismatic in design, often lack the depth needed to make their confrontations with Kenshin feel truly consequential. Several of the later arcs seem like a rehash of earlier material, relying on formulaic tropes rather than pushing the narrative forward or introducing more meaningful conflict.Characters: Shallow Yet FamiliarKenshin, the central character, is one of anime’s most iconic ""tragic heroes,"" but his personality is far from complex. His constant internal struggle between his...vow not to kill and his need to protect the innocent is an intriguing concept, yet it becomes repetitive. His character arc—while grounded in redemption—is frustratingly static for much of the series. Kenshin's decisions often feel predictable, as his sense of righteousness overshadows any real growth.The supporting cast, while colorful, are not much better. Kaoru, the headstrong dojo master, is a familiar anime archetype—a spirited but emotionally volatile woman who exists mostly to serve as Kenshin's emotional anchor. The side characters like Saito, Yahiko, and Megumi are often reduced to caricatures or plot devices, lacking the depth that would make them truly memorable. Their relationships with Kenshin are predictable, and while they do add moments of levity, the overall character dynamics feel one-dimensional at times.Conclusion:When it comes to the animation, Rurouni Kenshin is competent but rarely exceptional. The fight scenes, which should be the highlight of any action-oriented anime, are serviceable, though they often feel repetitive. The animation quality dips noticeably in the latter half of the series, particularly in some of the less action-heavy episodes, where characters are poorly drawn and backgrounds look generic. The lack of fluidity in certain battle sequences detracts from the intensity that the show is supposed to deliver."
Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii,"This anime is in the perspective of a delusional fujoshi and you'll probably not like it if you're a guy.The writing is very safe, like HR in the room kind of thing, but since it's not aimed at global audience, it's a little bit spicy sometimesThis feels more like an introduction to otaku culture rather than an inside view of an otaku circle. At the first episode we had a premise that the Momose wanted to successfully hide her otaku nature this time but this premise is betrayed in 1st or 2nd episode. She's an otaku but she likes bad boys which belittle her...otaku self, but the kind of otaku we see here in the form of Hirotaka is so bland, unimaginative and unrealistic, it's like a caricature of the guy in teenage girl novels, maybe even worse because he doesn't open up at all. Anything he does is forced in a way to progress the story. Now I see as I wrote this, looking at Momose I can see that her previous partners left her due to her irresponsible personality, she's not a wife material, just sex friend at best and she's getting passed the age of marriage. And she blames her misfortune on being and otaku rather than having a rotting personality who's head is outside of the realm of reality. To her life must be an imitation of the fictional material she consumes. I wish I never watched this."
Haikyuu!! Second Season,"I came back after the first season.The characters that weren't as flashed out as in the first season is and so we get to develop our feelings for others and really connect with them. We got to see some new characters that I hope we will see again.All characters grew and developed and are reaching their full potential to the sport and personal growth.The suspense build up was excellent making me hold my breath at some certain crucial points in it like when they reached the end or they all wanted the last point to win.However I felt like we never see the true ability...for anyone. Some characters you will either like or hate, there is no middle ground for some."
Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou,"Maybe expecting this to be anything even similar to Nichijou was a big mistake, but I had hoped this anime would be something similar to it. Still, I think there's a lot of appeal in just reliving the high school days and the unique experiences it allowed us to have with friends. And I got none of that with this anime. For a final comparison to Nichijou, despite it being insanely more whacky and outlandish, I found it way more relatable than this anime.Daily Life of High School Boys is really frustrating because it continues to be on the cusp of something fun and...relatable. But my hopes really started to die away by the first episode. I thought it was charming that the characters would just decide to randomly pretend they were in an RPG regardless of how dumb they looked, and I think that's an important quality to highlight. High school can often be a time when we try to hide and abandon our true selves and/or our favorite hobbies for fear that it may make us look dumb to our peers. So, a true friendship where they can just do what they want is great. One thing I liked about this anime was the real sense of friendship. At first, I thought the student council might in some way be the antagonists or bullies to our trio, but they're not. They make jabs at each other, but at the end of the day, they're friends, and it's very refreshing.But here in lies the problem. As nice as it is to be reminded we can have fun regardless of how we're judged, they do it near constantly. They really can seem like elementary school kids at times. And shouldn't have taken up the bulk of the scenarios. Unless this is just what theater kids do to kill time? I remember playing RPGs with my friends over, and we'd make up our own silly voices for the characters as we played and had a lot of fun in that, so there's definitely something nostalgic it could have tapped into, but it missed its mark.Now for the comedy itself. I probably exhaled air about 5 times during the whole run of this series. There are some ""cute"" jokes in this that I found mildly amusing, and that's about it. Episode 1 was probably the funniest, mainly because you don't know yet that the series will never try to stray from the very simple jokes. And that's just it; the show is safe and doesn't really try to make a lot of unique jokes. And unfortunately, when they do make a good joke, it's oftentimes that they just drag it out too long, and it loses any punch it had. I enjoyed the joke about the characters slipping into puddles, but after the 2nd or 3rd time, you know what to expect; there's no subversion anymore. Repeating the joke does not make it funnier. Then a lot of the time I can barely even identify the joke. I understand the show can be very lowkey, but it's to the point where I can't even figure out where I'm supposed to laugh. There were a lot of times a scene would end, and all I was left to think was, ""ok..."" and it gets hard to watch that over and over again.Characters: I'm gonna say it straight off the bat: I really do not like the way basically any of the female characters are written.  Yassan is fun, and Ringo is cute and probably the best-written of them, but that's about it. I get it. It's an anime about high school boys, but I get weird objectification vibe from them. I hated the skit where the entire point was just to look up Ringo's skirt, and that's the entire joke. I don't care if they feel ashamed afterward; that's something you don't do. The other girls are just really annoying. They all attack the boys for literally no reason. The scene where they try to shave Motoharu's beard is so weird? Like this literal toddler-type behavior, it's so weird. I'm not asking for these girls to act like your typical dere girls because I'd probably hate them even more, but it's just weird how randomly hostile and loud literally all of them are. There were some real missed opportunities. I liked that at the start, Motoharu seemed to have a great relationship with his sister, which was a bit healthier than most siblings, but then she also turned out to be crazy. It would have been a nice example to show that it's cool to have a great friendship with your sister. Something, again, can easily be made fun of in high school. Anyway, the post-credit funky high school girls... They're super obnoxious, and they don't end up tying into anything by the end, purely pointless. All they do is try to make themselves more appealing to boys, which, again, goes back to that weird objectification. It's taken to the 11th degree, so sure, it's still comedy, but it's just awkward. Plus, they make the same K-on movie joke twice, which is wild to see them just casually not address.The guys aren't much better, they're all so bland and they all blend into each other. I thought the main trio was gonna be fun to bounce off each other at first, but then they barely showed up together for the entire series, and I think that led to a lot of the show suffering because I think a decent dynamic could have been built off of them. It was annoying going into a lot of the different skits because you first had to try and figure out how the characters would react to each other. A lot of comedy revolves around you knowing the characters and their personalities; personalities bounce off each other, and that's what makes for some fun dynamics. So when you don't know what boy A thinks of boy B then you just sit there and watch the joke blandly play out.Lastly, art and music. The art is really bland. Some of the characters look cute, but most of them are average. Some of them look really ugly, some unintentional. I think it was more of a time crunch thing vs anything else, but still, there are a lot of not great shots in this. Because of this blandness, it makes it even harder to determine who's who unless they have some obvious distinguishing factor. Why do the student council boys look so similar to the main trio? There's no point. The girls aren't good either, a lot of them have very similar hair styles so a lot of the time, the characters had to directly say who they were before I understood anything. Also really hated how basically all the girls didn't have eyes. Except for Ringo and Yassan. Just why? It got pretty distracting and only made telling them apart harder. And for the music, it was pretty annoying. So much of it was repeated throughout the series, and it gets grating, especially the skit transition music. A lot of the music I wouldn't mind I think it sounds fine, and I actually like the heavy use of electric guitar, but there's not enough variety. The OP and ED are fiiiine. The ED has a weird charm to it for me, but I know that's just my incredibly weird tastes in music saying that, and to the average person would probably find it rather eargrating.Anyway, this anime is crazy mid, don't watch it. It's just a waste of time."
Buddy Complex,"Buddy Complex is okay. It’s fine. This show has serious potential, but it fails to deliver on any of it or knock you out of your seat, so what you’re left with by the end is a fairly bog standard anime that leaves no lasting impression, to the point where reviewing it actually took a fair bit of introspection just to tackle what it does wrong and what it does right.The main critique I would level at Buddy Complex is its story and its main cast. I have never seen somebody so slow on the uptake when it comes to the mechanics of a time...travel plot; it’s one thing that Aoba does not grasp the exact nature of the situation thrust upon him, but he spends so much time repeating the exact same talking points to people about events they clearly have no knowledge of, due to not experiencing them yet, that you are left with the impression Aoba grew up under a rock. It’s the kind of handling that blows straight past portraying somebody ignorant of a trope into a denial of common sense and basic deduction.Then there’s Hina, who has a whole lot of problems and is a pretty big can of worms that’s difficult to tackle while remaining spoiler-free. Suffice it to say, I’m surprised she’s portrayed as having any real loyalty to Zogilia, our main antagonist, when it seems to mean nothing in the face of her defection—an inevitable story point you will be aware of by the end of episode 1.Ultimately, to praise Buddy Complex after ragging on it for a minute, the cast of side characters are rather likable for what screen time they get. The only real complaint in regards to any of them is that they would have benefitted from time in the spotlight that was wasted on the main cast without really adding extra dimensions to them.As things progress, you definitely feel that things are picking up momentum. But the highs of the climax were damaged by the inane nature of Hina’s arc, to the point I was actually sympathizing with Bizon who was feeling more and more like the lone sane man in a mad world.As for the visuals, Sunrise was once again doing what they do best. The artistry of the show is consistent, there is never a noticeable drop in quality and said quality is quite good for the year it was released without being anything exceptional. However, they do deserve praise for delivering more 2d mechs rather than resorting to taking the lazy, easy way out with CG.The mechs themselves are sadly nothing to write home about on this one, which is the biggest mark the show has going for it after the characters. Bradyon and Luxon are some of the most generic and forgettable MC suits I’ve seen in a long time, and as for other ‘Valiancers’, they sadly don’t get enough time to leave an impression. For the most part, fights spend as much time in the cockpit as they do showing you the actual battle, so you never really get the chance to appreciate what you’re looking at.Fights that could be much worse. Enemy commanders do a good job of not falling into the same tactical rut. Once something loses its tactical edge, they tend to approach the issue from a different angle, so you are exposed to a nice bit of variety at least in that regard. Praise that I have to immediately damage because every fight ends in the exact way. The MCs break out their special technique, the show’s one piece of memorable music kicks in, and then it’s over or time for a retreat.That sums up Buddy Complex pretty well. It does something good, then it does something to damage that. 8s? 7s? Buddy Complex is no higher than a 6 and it gets a 5 from me. There are much better pickings out there for you."
Haikyuu!! Movie: Gomisuteba no Kessen,"I saw someone saying that this is the first time they didn't elevate the source material and i couldn't agree moreThe only issue with the movie I felt was it was much less intense than the show, mainly because it was short of time, the main reason Haikyuu seasons felt so intense was they stretched a game for around 6-8 episodes and a rare case when it's always good and intensity maintains, now they had around 3-4 episode runtime to do the same, and because of this you see a lot of instances where the set suddenly ended or something went way too fast in...one take without any drama and that is very un-Haikyuu like and may even disappoint you if you haven't seen enough sports Anime. The match felt like I'm watching 2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team, but with Haikyuu charactersDespite that the movie succesfully connects with you emotionally when it's needed and that's what makes it good, definitely worth a watch, just a bit overrated tho"
Death Parade,"In a certain sense, Death Parade is like a possibly better-written BokuraNO!, or at least somewhat more engaging in its attempt at a visceral—if not soap-operatic—appeal, made all the better since DP has a non-expendable core cast and an expendable secondary cast. Only there's a different manipulative psychological twist: ""Let's play a game."" This is almost the Saw franchise of seinentard realism, just without Rube Goldbergisms, fully loaded squibs, and gutter-Hollywood schlock. The first episode, though maybe not as complex as later entries, is among the better ones because we're thrown head-first into the game without any explanation.You probably know what's going to happen from...reading the synopsis, but there is a mildly sinister feel to the casual bar atmosphere, and we've yet to be acquainted with how the judgment process works. Now, take all of these dramatic twists and turns, and we'll repeat a back-and-forth morality play for nearly each episode with a new set of Bokuranos (meaning disposable characters who are around for only one or a couple episodes), exploring themes, situations, and moral conundrums more than characters. While some of the scenarios are more compelling than others, it's easy to get a sense of claustrophobia from being tucked inside of the bar for so many deliberations. The Bokuranos are either directly connected, have overlapping moral issues or situations, are complementary, or opposites.Although an aesthetic nitpick, I wish this could have had a more Japanese aesthetic for the judgment process rather than these cheap bar games. Talk about degrading. ""We're not sure what fate you should have, so maybe you'd like to play Street Fighter II, and we'll be unfair fucks and see how you react."" Sometimes the games are a bit fairer, but they'll do things like pair a single mother and a shut-in and have them play video games; obviously, the latter is going to be better at this, which is going to cause frustration for the former because there is the presumption that they have to win the game or something terrible will happen. In this instance, the single mother has responsibilities like kids and didn't commit suicide, while the gamer shut-in offed himself, so here is an example where many characters have a lot to lose and others have no real concern (somewhat ameliorated by the selective memories at least). It also doesn't look at societal problems with any real depth, since our Bokuranos barely get 20 minutes to strut their stuff, though sometimes they might get two whole episodes. On top of that, the characters are disoriented and thrust into a world they don't understand. There is reason to be suspicious and afraid. Their memories are selectively inserted or removed. The setup will not be a good match for certain personality types and temperaments. Everything is stacked against all participants in such a way that you should expect them to not be on their best behavior; hence, it comes across as overly cruel and manipulative. Although anyone watching this probably already felt manipulated by the maudlin piano and downpour of tears and snot that occur nearly every episode. The bar needs to keep around a box of Kleenex, as it's disgusting to behold!The system of judgments determining the fate of the characters is silly and based on minimal information for those handling the deliberations. The story does critique the arbitrary nature of the process and has a ""We've got to change the system, man"" subplot, which never goes anywhere because the series didn't get a second season thus far. This critique still doesn't make the concept any more palatable for a series, and the whole thing seems so overly asinine as to have been a practical joke to have ever been implemented as a system at all. Or D-g is just doing it for the lulz because it gets boring to play games of pool for eternity with lolibaba. As with most moralistic series, judgments are usually made in a preachy way. They take what is an abstract concept of how death is handled with the void or reincarnation and concretize it with bureaucratic autism. Something is lost in the process, rendering the series hollow in execution and wholly inorganic.Now that I have more distance from the series. I have to imagine re-watching this, and seeing them play through the games again in each of these scenarios is a terrible chore. And that is a necessary evaluation of any media you consume. Would I be willing to rewatch it and does the formula it presents only work for one watch and would forevermore be monotonous and less appealing after the prior exposure? Sure, if I were a fan of a 1,000 episode series, I would probably only watch it once because that is a huge time sink, but that's not the same as it being worth watching again. Even at a measly and very bingeable 12 episodes, I feel Death Parade has minimal replay value. Everything about the way they work through the games is so artificial and boring. There are tonal clashes all over the place, whether it's the cancerous OP's undiluted barf fuel, the trashy game of Twister, the red-headed tsundere punk, the cheesy old man with the Hawaiian shirt and ratty top-knot, the sassy character design, the stinky comedy bits, or the ""deep"" exploration of the inner workings and subtleties of the death game system, which I couldn't care less about. Also, speaking of out of place, a fight scene between Ginti and Decim? What is the point? There aren't any other fight scenes and it felt like the series randomly decided to turn into a battle shonen, featuring flashy attacks that are completely useless for any other purpose.The main and supporting cast aren't much better than the disposable Bokuranos. Decim is particularly wooden and creepy, just like his BJD collection. Most of them are one-dimensional or solely for forwarding the plot. The various arcs involving different characters are a mixed bag, with some being better than others, yet Onna's development and the emotions on display are often handled decently enough and probably the only thing that had a lasting impact, for she is pretty much a bewildered stand-in for the viewer, sharing the same repulsion to the system but being trapped inside of this hopeless box of a world and judged all the same. The world-building for the one and only area (along with a couple other big rooms) we inhabit is lackluster and has no real presence. Not much is explained, and what is explained doesn't really matter. There's no indication that there will be another season to complete the series, and the presentation of the story is rushed and unsatisfying in the same way as many of the sadly flawed OVAs of the 1980s and 1990s' era of anime."
White Album 2,"Love is like snow. It is beautiful, but it can also be so cold.This is a fitting method to describe White Album 2. It is not your typical romance anime, where everything is mostly smooth sailing and ends happily-ever-after. Instead it portrays romance as it truly is through the vast variety of emotions it takes you through. From the joyous moments as they push towards their dream performance, the bittersweet moments after the confession, the tragic moments as the three start drifting apart, and finally the heartbreaking moment in the end where everything tumbles down. This is truly what romance is, not merely one aspect...or another, but rather so many things coming together to create something indescribable, and can only be experienced.And it is no coincidence that White Album 2 was able to have such an emotional impact. Many aspects of the show were excellent, which allowed for such an excellent result. The story may not be anything too out of the ordinary, but it keeps you hooked from beginning to end. The plot is well established, with pretty much no plot holes and perfect pacing. I am a sucker for good character writing, and White Album 2 has well exceeded my expectations in this regard. The character buildups, developments, and dynamics for the three main characters are really impeccable. It is precisely because of this that we can grow so attached to the characters and their experiences. Last but certainly not least, the music is probably some of the best out there. Not only are the songs goated in itself (Todokanai Koi my beloved), but the use of the music to enhance the impact of important scenes is masterful. Ultimately, I can confidently say there is no aspect of White Album 2 that I'm really critical of.The themes presented in this anime are also very well developed. Feelings are a complicated thing, and often times they are contradictory. This can be seen in various moments throughout the anime, whether it be Haruki's indecisiveness, Kazusa constantly hiding her true self and desires, or Setsuna's love for Haruki and her desire for the three to remain together. Indeed, this is only to be expected for any human. This is part of the reason why White Album 2 is able to get the seemingly cliche love triangle to actually work out. The themes and characters are developed well enough that viewing the love triangle isn't actually frustrating.  It isn't merely two girls competing for one guy, but also three friends trying to stay together. There isn't really one person you can blame for everything falling apart, every character has their own flaws, burdens, and insecurities (there are some who specifically hate Setsuna for her selfishness, but that only reveals their own naivete and hypocrisy). One can perhaps see that this unfortunate fate was sealed  the moment the three first performed White Album together.It truly is a shame that White Album 2 isn't discussed more. There is no doubt that this is one of, if not the best romance anime ever.  For those of you who have watched the anime but not the vn, I suggest you give it a try. Not only will you get to experience this unforgettable story again, but there is also further content after the introductory chapter (what the anime covered). In the end, there is no review I could ever write that would capture all my thoughts and feelings of White Album 2, which simply shows how much of a masterpiece this is."
Made in Abyss: Retsujitsu no Ougonkyou,"Season 1, amazing. The third movie, also amazing. Season 2... a flaming pile.They departed from world building to just focusing on a single layer. The new characters are all irritating and having to sit and wait for an explanation has not paid off as of finishing episode 5.It's odd for the sake of being odd. Annoying language makes it seem like a dark version of Pokemon with some fixation on buttholes.If I was really high I might enjoy it as a ""what the hell is happening"", but the storytelling went right out the window and I'm so disappointed I'm no gonna wait to see if...it gets better.Others may still enjoy it for some backstory, but it was just not for me. At all.This is the first anime I really wanted to see but had literally no interest halfway in due to it having done a complete 180 from adventuring, suspense, storytelling, and a bit of action to some lame new guys in town trash. I'm sure it would make more sense after watching the entirety, but that's not happening."
Free! Movie 5: The Final Stroke - Kouhen,"It all started with a relay and it ended with a relay. The last send off for the series didn't disappoint with it's indefinite conclusion. While there was some drag on the pacing, the tension that was created for Haruka and the struggles that we've never seen beforehand is quiet fitting from what we know of him. We have seen him grow as a kid to an adult making bonds through swimming, and reconciling inevitable feuds with his peers. The last send off for him to overcome his own struggles with loneliness, especially from his lack of familial relationships has left a mark on him...that even the unwavering Haru can crumble from if ever his friends ""abandoned"" him, and gave us a glimpse of who he really is, under all that cool composure since the beginning.This series has always been about him, his relationship with swimming and how it defines the relationship and dynamic he has with his friends.It may follow a very loose plotline, and nothing about the series was as grandeur as what we've seen from others, but that's the beauty of Free! A refreshing progression of following what you love and what path you can take influenced by the people around you. Growing with them, and learning from them. It evoked that feel from the get-go and it never strayed too far from it.One of my griefs about this movie and the entire series was how they handled Makoto from S3 to here. He's very unrecognizable from who he started as, and just became a shell for fanservice. Otherwise, it was a good finale."
Berserk 2nd Season,"In 2015, the announcement of a Conviction Arc adaptation for Berserk was met with excitement. However, the final product was a mix of exaggerated hype and disappointment. As someone who watched the season weekly in 2016, I was initially disappointed and even angry. The animation was not an improvement from the 1997 version and did not have the same art style as the Memorial or movie adaptations. Looking back, I realize that my younger self was quick to criticize rather than appreciate. It is important to note that unless you are an animation student or an animator, it is not fair to label certain...styles as ""lazy"" without understanding the process. Similarly, commenting on the colors or animation without having read the manga or understanding the historical context is not valid. Calling Berserk 2016 a ""slideshow of pictures"" is a statement that shows a lack of understanding of animation. Anime typically runs at 24 frames per second and is made up of still images with moving lip flaps. Therefore, it is technically a slideshow. The 2016 and 17 adaptation uses a combination of traditional and 3D animation, which can be seen as an experimental approach to see what works and what doesn't. While some scenes may not have been successful, others were executed well. In terms of the plot of 16, the first five episodes may seem rough, but it is important to remember that Guts is also going through a difficult time. The show's depressive tone effectively resonates with the audience, as Guts' existential dread of being alone is a powerful representation of the Hedgehog's Dilemma, which was also explored in Evangelion. Upon rewatching the season(s), I found myself with a completely different perspective. The low rating for Berserk 2016 and 17 is unjust and should not be taken at face value. It is heavily influenced by the bias of ""fans"" who were expecting a better animation than the 1997 version. However, the story remains faithful to the manga, with the exception of one character's backstory. These arcs mark a turning point for Guts as he begins to develop new characteristics and sheds his nihilistic and apathetic tendencies for existentialism and empathy. These are some of the best arcs in Berserk and introduce new characters who embark on a life-changing journey together. Guts is a self-insert of the author, Kentaro Miura, and is as real as any of us. I urge those who gave these seasons a low ratings solely based on the animation to reconsider and rewatch it. If you find it too dark, then it may not be for you. However, if you truly love Berserk, the animation should not be a deciding factor. I sincerely hope that the same style is retained for the next adaptation, if there is one."
Happy Sugar Life,"A psychological thriller with a crapsaccharine twist- I want to rate this anime higher, but for all the qualities that make it appealing, it fails to exceed in any given area.Happy Sugar Life hooks you with the protagonist's Death Note-esque calculated Machiavellianism, and the short 12-episode season culminates in a much more satisfying conclusion than the 2006 anime. However, the mid-season was painfully slow-paced and featured side-plots which failed to grab my attention. Conversely, all they did was interrupt my suspended disbelief- how did all these unhinged characters converge? One answer might have lied in Happy Sugar Life's religious undertones, but this explanation was barely...addressed by the season's end—truly a missed opportunity.This anime is a good pick for those who want a psychological thriller with a captivating cynical protagonist, sans the shonen action that characterises so much of modern anime. However, consider ""Classroom of the Elite"" to satisfy a Death Note itch, Kakegurui for a similarly cerebral female-led high-stakes drama, or, if shonen is your thing, Mirai Nikki for another obsessed tsundere psycho-in-pink."
Girls Band Cry,"This is one of those anime of which I will have much to say, so, buckle in, I guess.This anime is both a spiritual sibling to ""Bocchi the Rock"", and yet it couldn't be more different.  ""Bocchi"" is kind of a gag anime that happens to have a story - which is, I guess, somewhat understandable considering its origination as a 4-koma manga.  ""Girls Band Cry"" is an original anime, and doesn't have any of that baggage coming from source material, so it is free to be what it is.  I loved Bocchi and I considered her story to be inspiring and...at times emotional, but other than being about the formation of a girl rock band, it has very little in common beyond the atmosphere, which both seem to share to some degree.  Maybe that just has something to do with rock being a bit grungy, by nature.And what it is, is a story about coming of age, about self-actualization, about finding comfort in the most unlikely of friends as five girls who are very much unlike each other form a band and try to make it to the top.While there are some very funny moments in this anime, this is not a comedy.  This is a drama.  There is a lot of emotion, a lot of crying, a lot of confrontation (the number of times they have a loud confrontation smack in the middle of a public place is somewhat beyond belief).  But at the end of the day, there is no character that escapes the ""coming of age"" that this anime, at its core, is about.And the characters... wow, the characters.  They come alive.  It's almost like they're real people, that's how well written they are.  Nina is an annoying ""Morality monster"" with a strong sense of justice that has gotten her in a whole heap of trouble, Momoka is a guitarist who left her previous band just as they were on the cusp of going pro, Subaru is a high school drummer who Nina didn't get along with at first, Ruba and Tomo are friends who have their own story..  So much care is taken with the characters that they just come alive, and it's amazing.  I have never seen a character with Ruba's name, by the way.  And as they bumble through forming a band, you start to think they're real, and that's what makes this an amazing anime, and worthy of a high rating.There is some controversy about the animation, and I think it's warranted, because they used 3D animation all the way through, which is pretty unique.  And they did it well.  My complaints about the animation have nothing at all to do with the fact, itself, that it's 3D, my complaints have to do with the fact that they did *exactly* what almost every other 3D animated show/movie does - and that's using overexaggerated movements.  If you've ever seen a Disney/Pixar movie, you'll know what I'm talking about.  Sometimes their movements are fluid and natural, and those are impressive.  Other times they're pretty much hamming for the ""camera"", and that is so amazingly annoying I can't even describe it.  They *almost* had it.  *Almost* had a beautiful anime with animation that would have been almost impossible for any other 2D studio to match, and they blew it.  That's so disappointing.The music is really good, the OP is unironically good, and that's not the most common of things.  It has some really weird rhythms that work really well.  All the insert songs are pretty good, and I'd say that they took a lot of care to get that right.  Though the instrument animation isn't really all that great, especially the keyboard animation.  I know that's difficult, but they took so much care with everything else, that's just a mite bit annoying too.In summary, it's a high quality anime with well written characters, great animation, and great music, that somehow manages to just fall short on the animation, and given how much care they obviously put into it, that's a disappointing and borderline unforgivable self-own.Recommend from me, strong recommend, actually, but don't be surprised if it doesn't really blow your socks off."
Kimi wa Houkago Insomnia,"One of the most innocent, purest romance anime out there. There are not many tropes like in other romance animes, their connection and feelings seem natural, the way they fall for each other over time is a great journey, it's nothing like a boring slow burn.The only criticism one can have is the pacing. Even without being familiar with the source material you will feel that some scenes got cut, meaning sometimes there's no continuation or consequence for some stories or actions, sometimes there's a weird time skip.Other than that there's no other issue with this anime, it does everything as it should. The music...is fitting, the scenery is always charming with the night sky. The characters and dialouges are both on point.For anyone who likes romance or slice of life it's a must watch, for anyone else it's a great starter in the genre. It's simply calming and beatiful.Fingers crossed for season 2"
Bakeneko Anzu-chan,"So I randomly saw an ad for this movie 2 days ago and drove 35 minutes to the theatre to see it today. For some reason the trailer just really impressed me especially the animation. I felt like the characters were well rounded and it was an overall lighthearted film, with some dark moments (in my opinion) which i will stop there to avoid spoilers. While I don't consider myself a very strict rater per say, there was just simply nothing I disliked about the film. It's broke my top 10 which it has been a while since I watched something that broke my top...10. Overall, I don't normally take the time to write reviews and I was really surprised this is barely breaking a 6. The plot wasn't anything complicated but I think that's what I enjoyed about it compared to films that require more brainpower and analyzation to understand them. (Like suzume or the boy and the heron.)"
Dandadan,"At first, Dandadan didn’t appeal to me. The show seemed to try too hard to be different, with concepts like spirits and aliens stealing wombs and penises, which felt more forced than creative. The first two episodes gave the impression that the anime cared more about being shocking than building a solid foundation. However, as the story progresses, everything changes. The protagonists – Momo Ayase and Ken Takakura (Okarun) – gain depth and become captivating. Their dynamic goes beyond the initial clichés, with moments that highlight their vulnerability and personal growth.Okarun, in particular, undergoes a striking transformation that doesn’t make him more confident but instead...more melancholic and introspective, adding an unexpected emotional layer to the series. The balance between humor and drama is well done, and episode 7 is a perfect example, delivering genuine emotional impact that made me truly care about the characters and their journey.If it continues at this pace, Dandadan has the potential to be epic. Despite a beginning that felt forced, the series proves it can deliver far more than just an odd concept. With complex protagonists and a narrative that balances action and emotion, it’s a work full of promise."
Akiba Meido Sensou,"I don't watch anime as frequently as I used to, but I really enjoyed this one and I watched all in one day. I really liked the sense of humor and I thank that they do not explain the jokes as animes use to do. Overall, I think it has many interesting turns, funny moments, they know also how to transmit tension. I really liked it. This anime is not as centered in the characters themselves, but in the plot, and I think that is okay. I didn't have much expectatives when I first started it and I feared that it may be cringe but...it is not. I hope you like it if you give it an opportunity:)"
Zombieland Saga,"This show should be called ""Why Have You Not Had This Conversation Yet?: The Anime"".When putting characters together from different time periods you will naturally, in Episode 2 at the latest, have ""This Conversation"" that I referenced before - that being the realization that their lives as they knew them are over, uncertainty about the time they find themselves in and their futures, and so much more (such as actually getting to know each other before each girl's designated episode). There would be immediate drama, conflict, and wonder. What does the girl from 1870ish think about the modern era? Does she find everyone's manner of...speech too casual and slangy? Perhaps she thinks modern outfits are unnecessarily revealing and dishonorable. These are just some of the conversations that should be had IMMEDIATELY because they are immediately relevant to that character. They would be the first things on her mind. And EACH girl should have her own concerns.Instead they all seem to adjust to their new existence in less than a single scene, with only a few quirks reminding us they're from different times. Really, there are other problems I have with the show, but they pale in comparison to this one. It overshadows everything and renders the characters invalid. The girl from the Meiji Restoration (more than any other character shown) is a lie. Her entire character is a lie. How can I get invested in the characters when I can see the writer moving them around from scene to scene? They're like puppets on strings that we're simply TOLD are from different time periods, without being sufficiently shown right from the start.And it isn't like it has to be all drama either. This is a comedy after all. With a premise like this, the jokes write themselves! Imagine, they're talking about taking pictures, and the one girl is flabbergasted and makes a huge deal out of not having to sit still for as much as 30 minutes for each one. That would probably be hilarious, but we won't know because the writers decided to go the blandest, most cliche route instead, with repetitive, unfunny gags, the delinquent girl being insufferable, and their producer shouting, being lol-so-random, and being oddly mean to the girls under his care. Oh, and one of the girls not regaining her humanity and being a brain-hungry zombie. Peak comedy, that right there.As a side note, despite the constant jokes about them being undead, it's hard to actually tell. Why can a zombie sleep? Why can they feel touch? Why can they taste? Why do they smoke? Do they really need to eat? And since they do eat, do they need to use the bathroom? Zombies? Using the bathroom? Madness! Just like the characters themselves, their status as zombies is a lie. There's almost nothing differentiating them from any other living, human girls living in 2018 anime-Japan."
Koi wa Futago de Warikirenai,"I feel guilty for giving this review because I hate one thing about this show: Naori. Naori is a giga-nerd. The main character is also a nerd, but when he's not with Naori at least he talks about other things. All interactions between the MC and Naori are nerdy references to movies (which you probably haven't seen). I'm not talking about pop culture, I am talking about really deep rabbithole stuff like mystery authors, Godzilla-era monster movies, Star Trek. These are the ones I remember because I recognize them, but 90% of the conversations I do not understand at all.I want to give them props...for portraying a nerd pretty accurately. But I also did not enjoy it because I felt out of the loop for a very big portion of the show. It's hard to review anything beyond that because that's the only thing that comes to mind. Naori is an important character and you see her a lot. Since I couldn't tolerate her, she overshadows everything else.The rest of the stuff is objectively not bad at least. The main character although plays it safe, struggles with resolving this issue rather than just being so dense that nothing progresses. Rumi is a scaredy cat but that's just a character trait of hers. She never struck me as annoying, just true to her character. The only character I didn't really like (besides Naori) was Shiena, but she wasn't too big of an issue for me.Try watching it and see whether your enjoyment overshadows Naori or vice versa. You may or may not like this. It's not objectively bad, but it might be specifically terrible for some people."
"""Oshi no Ko"" 2nd Season","What a fantastic season. All the episodes were incredible.Starting with the promise left by last season of making the Theatrical Presentation arc something incredible, which actually happened. All the dramas of the characters involved in the play, be it direction or actors, being dealt with during the play was incredible, it took the drama of the performance to another level.It was also very well constructed narratively. The impression made was that the anime dealt with all the setbacks and embroglios of a theatrical project in an extremely believable way.The characters here were also a show in themselves. Even those of lesser relevance, when necessary,...had their highlights and in an excellent way.The dramas and mysteries that came from the first season continued and took new directions. The romance resolutions were satisfactory and the mysteries were elevated even further, which greatly increases the anticipation for the sequel. The new turn in the story after the end of the season was something very well realized and in my opinion leaves the story even more unique alive in the memory.Technically speaking, excellent too. The direction showed off here and the animation followed perfectly, without any major reservations.Finally, Oshi no Ko, once again among the best anime of the year!"
Dallos,"Dallos is a 4 episode OVA series from 1983-1985 that's notable for being the first ever anime OVA (original video animation), a format that would become immensely popular, especially throughout the 1990s, but has seemingly become almost extinct in the modern era with the rise of ONAs (original net animation).  The pedigree of being the first anime OVA is the main reason I wanted to watch this anime, but beyond that it's nothing too special.  I don't think it's bad either, though.  It was a fun watch, it's extremely short, it has drama, action, moral ambiguity, and some good sci-fi ideas....I think that if it got a full TV anime series it could have been much greater.  But as it stands it was somewhat enjoyable, but it's still hard to recommend for any other reason than watching the first anime OVA, and I probably won't remember it for very long.  Oh, and Mamoru Oshii was responsible for this OVA, who later became known for Patlabor and the original Ghost in the Shell Movie, so that's something I guess."
Bakeneko Anzu-chan,"It seems I am the sole review for Ghost Cat Anzu as of today, which is a shame. I saw it through a short theatrical window and was the only one in my theatre to enjoy what I found to be a pretty charming story of found-family. The animation for me was the strongest stand-point, first directed in live action and then animated over in rotoscrope. While it might be jank for some, I found it charming and lanky, the yokai / ghost characters being the stand-outs, whether it be the titular Anzu, who's lumber and laugh makes it impossible not to be charmed, or...his friend Frog who ribbits with glee as he digs holes and enjoys his hot springs. The movie moves at a pace that a cat would enjoy, going from small vignettes in the countryside about what happens when a 37 year old ghost cat drives a motorized scooter without a license, or a god of poverty who overstays his welcome by following everybody he deems to have misfortune. I think ultimately, that is what will make or break the movie for most viewers. Much of the central plot, following a girl who misses her mother and father, or learning to get along with someone you previously dimissed, is nothing you haven't seen before. There's are themes that have been explored better and more in depth in countless other anime, such as Anohana or Toradora! Following loneliness, loss, etc. The movie will go scene from scene of hijinks, living on the countryside, etc. until they reach Tokyo where the plot takes a turn for the more whimsical in the last act. Some viewerrs might actually get a lot out of the finale and how it deals with moving on, but for those bored with the first two acts it is quite the tonal shift. So while I believe Ghost Cat Anzu has a pace & plot might not be for everyone, I believe that with it's strong character design and animation it is definitely a worthy lazy Sunday watch."
Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka IV: Shin Shou - Yakusai-hen,"I can say for sure that this season is shaping up to be one of the best of the series. Season 1 was pretty good, 2 was trash, 3 was mixed, 4 part 1 was good, but this one is looking great. For the first time, people are dying in situations that are threatening, which is a massive upgrade from the previous seasons. Mistakes that characters make are met with actual consequences. Now, I'm hoping that this will extend to the mistake the MC makes too (which god knows there are many), but considering the previous seasons, I'm super happy with just this improvement.Bell is...also becoming more interesting as he stares down at the cruelty of the dungeon, which I hope will change him into a more mature person. The ingredients are certainly there. Now, it's up to the author to cook with them.I will update this review once I finish this season, and I'm hoping to all of the Danmachi gods that I won't have to knock it down. It would be such a shame."
Ookami to Koushinryou: Merchant Meets the Wise Wolf,"I never write any reviews. But for this remake I just cannot handle the dissapointed I encountered. Just watch the old one. You can't fully feel how Holo is like. Art even if it looks better / fresh at the begining is actually is very poor in detailed sense. Ahhh... My childhoods best anime was torn to pieces. When it comes to ""fan service"", it's been a an inseparable part of the main character's animalism, very sophisticated. But they removed it which results in you perceiving Holo like a casual humanArt style - bad, not matching the anime well.Details - poor.Voice actors - same actors...but worse performance"
Blue Giant,"""I'll keep this short and sweet. The movie was amazing. The music and visuals during the performances were stunning, and the characters and story were compelling. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 10 was the CGI segments. I'm not the biggest animation critic, but the CG took me out of some scenes completely—though there were moments where it blended well. I’m not sure if they used it for accuracy or to save money, but I’d much prefer slightly inaccurate playing over a distracting CGI presence. Even if accuracy was the goal, I feel they could have taken a 'Kids on the Slope'...approach and used rotoscoping instead."
Bocchi the Rock!,"Came for the smaller hitboxes and cute lesbians, stayed for the great soundtrack, smooth animation, well-written characters and laughs! I hope you can enjoy it as much as i did! (i basically binged the whole series, please watch it im begging you) it wont let me submit review so ill just go on about individual things i liked, i feel like they showcased social anxiety pretty well! there was never a song that didnt make me go along to the beat, i quite enjoyed the plot and story, plus the growth of the characters, and i hope they make a second season of this at...some point in the future"
Sakamichi no Apollon,"Absolutely incredible show that will always have a special place in my heart but Christ on a bike do some of the characters act in the most stupid was. Especially Richie, like omg dude wtf are you doing???The story is beautiful and deeply moving... apart from when Richie does some stupid shit and ruins it for a while.The art style was incredible and fits the story so well.The music I mean the MUSIC. I love it so much. The jazz numbers always get me and always make me feel so muchThe characters all have some depth but they do have the flaw...of sometimes just randomly doing stupid shit for no reason.In some cases characters react very realistic and normally and I understand why they do the stupid stuff because despite it being stupid it is realistic but god damn sometimes characters do the weirdest stuff for no reason.The biggest non-issue issue with the show is that the two main boys have so much god damn chemistry and I just wanted them to kiss at least once. Like come on!The show is incredible and I love it so much"
Shin Evangelion Movie:||,"The simple and pure question about whether you like this or not is: what is Evangelion for you? What does it mean to you?For me the answer is a bit complicated, yet simple. Evangelion is peak of psychology drama, it's something you want to see before you know you need to see it. It's something you will truly enjoy when you'll get the deeper thought of this piece and it will change your mindset forever. It's something you will truly hate, if you see it just a simple chaos of fighting robots and depressed childs.The story, since the first anime series, is stealing things from...Book of Genesis, mythology and psychology. And who can literally complain after this? 1/2 of the ""fun"" with Evangelion is watching this movie, previous movies, original series. 1/2 of the ""fun"" with Evangelion is to think about its point, about the story, characters, psychology in it, about the symbolism in it.Evangelion is the perfection between being halfway happy and halfway in agony. After so many years of watching anime nothing simply didn't touch my emotions as much as this. And I am pretty sure it applies to many other people.Anno and Sadamoto are simply 2 geniuses. Why? Look at what they created :)"
One Piece: Yuruganu Seigi! Kaigun no Hokoritakaki Log!,"From the title of the episode to the placement of it, to the actual content. This is literally a World Govt. propaganda screening to the core lmao.Let’s forget about the unfortunate timing of the airing, literally sandwiched in-between the hype episodes of Garp’s invasion of Pirate Island.It recaps all Admiral and important Marine officers (Sorry Smoker) and speeds up through some information and history of such, probably to hype up the stakes of the arc.A realization that has caught up to me recent year is that, the best One Piece arcs tend to always have Navy heavily involved at a larger scope, probably which is...why this recap really felt like a meal. It was a good watch and an entertaining one at that."
Rokka no Yuusha,"The dialouge from episode 1 on is a bunch of word salad and conversations are exceedingly stupid. Nearly every time there is any explanation, they just stop talking for plots sake.There is little to no character development throughout aside from Adlet. And he is ridiculously annoying. The number of times you hear ""strongest man in the whole world"" is annoying. It is made to be a joke at one point, but still continues to a point after.As far as mystery, this is terribly written and doesn't end up coming to a full conclusion. It never will in anime land because the first season is a...heaping pile of garbage. Every clue or hint at who it is is set up to be a ""twist"" but could gave easily been explained or looked into if the characters weren't all morons. Oh, and random love at first sight that adds nothing.This is the first anime I put on x2 and just listened to like an audio book since there is about 10 minutes of action in its entirety.Last. Huge plot hole. Fiends are spawned from the Demon Lord. Yet they can reproduce. They have family and friends. They can somehow ""engineer"" specific abilities. This makes absolutely no sense and is just thrown in to try making this horrid plot have an extra element of mystery."
ChäoS;HEAd,"Thought I'd got through the other Science Adventures, thank god I didn't start with this one or might have done the lot.Did Stein;Gate years ago when it was all the rage, and it was great having that weekly release.Have since done Robotics and Occultics - neither on the same level but watchable.This on the other hand... you hear there's a lot wrong with it and they aren't wrong.Animation and Voice Acting is great (except the extra squeeky voiced one - get in the bin with this crap continued dubbing).But it's the story - it's just not engaging and really badly paced.First episode is great and...then off the cliff it goes and pretty much flatlines. Even when you get revelations they just don't land.Oh OP and ED music is unmemorable generic anime."
Monster,"I have been recommended Monster for a while now, but I was always a bit hesistant to try it out, because it has 74 episodes and that is quite the commitment, but since I enjoyed Pluto (despite some issues here and there), another work from the same author last year, I decided to give it a shot finally. Because I thought, maybe having 74 episodes would fix some of the issues I had with Pluto. But the thing is, the opposite was the case (though as you can see, I still rated it fairly high).But let's start with the good things. The first 10 episodes...are really interestingly made, because it's not quite clear yet where the show wants to go and the stretch in between episode 25 and episode 38 are definitely some of the best thriller episodes you can watch. Furthermore, the anime plays in Germany (and Czech Republic for a bit) and the attention to detail is astounding. Not only are all the letters and newspapers in German, but the cities are very closely drawn to what they truly look like. It's been fun to see small details in the background and say ""Oh yeah, that's this building"" despite there being nearly 30 years in between when the anime plays and today. Lastly, I do like the general themes of the anime and some side characters like Grimmer are really well done.But if this review is mixed, it means that there are also problems, big enough to make me dislike the show at certain parts. One of the biggest problems is the length. As mentioned above, this show has 74 episodes and if you think this would mean that there is a lot more depth to the characters, then you are sadly mistaken. Instead of using the time to create some really interesting, multi-layered characters, the anime likes to repeat itself over and over again. While Tenma has a really interesting arc in the first 10 episodes, he becomes a really boring character for the rest of the show and the most interesting part (episodes 25-38) has him absent for 90% of it which is not what you would like to have for your main character. And the problem is, this does not just go for Tenma, but also the side characters (with some exceptions) and most importantly the main antagonist of the show. The reasion why episodes 25-38 are working so well is because it uses completely new characters (so there isn't as much repetition), but it's also the only point in the entire show where the antagonist is actually present and the anime is SHOWING you what he is like rather than just telling you.And that is the biggest problem for me, the show is telling you way more than it is showing you. It always tells you how evil the main antagonist is, but aside from this one period, you don't really see it. I guess this was done to make him more mysterious, but it just didn't help with the engagement for me when the show is this long. That isn't to say that the show isn't trying to show you something every now and then, but most of the time, it's failing, because things like with Nina are so dragged out that they don't leave much impression once you have all the information. The only time this was done well, was with Grimmer in my opinion, which is probably also why he is the best character in the show imo.What is left at the end is a show that has some interesting ideas, a total of around 20-30 episodes that are really strong, but also more than 40 episodes that feel a bit dragged at best and completely pointless at worst as the show keeps introducing new side characters that only appear for around two episodes most of the time which would be fine if the main cast was more interesting. It's definitely a show you should try out I think, but you should be aware that it can really drag at points. Also, I feel the ending is kind of meh. I get what they were trying to go for there, but I don't think they really nailed that idea."
86,"11 episodes of perfection.So very rarely does an anime come out and I binge watch it within one day, especially in this current period. That is what 86 is, a journey that transcends emotions, that transcends actions.We see a world based on status, plagued by racism and the characters we follow are some of the greatest individuals you would ever get the grace of following.We get to know them for less than 8 episodes, some we get to know for less than 3. But even with 10 minutes of screen time, they all felt so real.From the start to the very end, I...told myself, this would be a mere 8/10 show. It’ll be good, but honestly it was more than that. This was perfect. The way it was shot, the soundtracks Hiroyuki composed. If i was told Hajime Isayama made this, I wouldn’t even think about disagreeing.The show blew me away, the way it always showed more than one perspective, even going as far as showing a third in episode 10. This was a masterpiece I'd watch a thousand times over, a journey of sadness, grief, anger. A journey to the end."
Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 3rd Season,"I am beyond bored, counting episode 1 as 6 episoeds I have seen 13 episodes and nothing happens, supposedly a year has happened and no character has grown, this is his first death after the witch reveal and he reacts by doing nothing.A whole year for the mc to mature and instead of asking for help, he continues to charge in like an absolute moron when he supposedly learnt his lesson in season 2.It is just awful, a bunch of characters thrown togheter doing nothing, the show is beyond bloated, it has been totally reduced to waifus and nonsensical fights. I cant stand the amount...of freaking monologues that say nothing in this season, how did this get so bad."
30-sai made Doutei dato Mahoutsukai ni Nareru Rashii,"This is literally the happiest anime I've watched in a long time, I'm still shocked at how the last episode ended (I really wasn't expecting it to have such a happy ending). The anime is fluffy, the moments when Adachi reads Kurosawa's thoughts are always give me secondhand embarrassment, but it's with Adachi's power that the anime manages to show the part of failed communication and how insecure he feels.Despite talking so well about the subjects it addresses, it's a very simple story in itself, with a plot that I can't even tell if it really is a plot, the development focuses only on...Adachi and his ""boring"" appearance is very romanticized (in quotes because he's always drawn beautifully).Original -Esse é literalmente o anime mais feliz q eu assisti em muito tempo, ainda to chocada em como terminou o ultimo episódio (realmente não tava esperando que tivesse um final tão feliz).O anime é engraçadinho e fluffy, os momentos quando o Adachi lê os pensamentos do Kurosawa são sempre vergonha alheia, mas é com esse poder do Adachi que o anime consegue mostrar bem a parte de comunicação falha e como ele se sente inseguro.Apesar de falar tão bem sobre os assuntos abordados, é uma história bastante simples em si, com um plot que eu nem sei dizer se realmente é um plot, o desenvolvimento se foca apenas no Adachi e é muito romantizado sua aparência ""sem graça"" (entre aspas pq ele é sempre desenhado lindamente)."
Naze Boku no Sekai wo Daremo Oboeteinai no ka?,"I don't really write reviews but I really need to share my thoughts on this one.Not sure if spoiler alert, but storytelling was bad. The first and second halves were basically the same: mc and company raid the enemy base, each of them fights someone, mc and girl fight the main bad guy, sword gives him a power up, they win.The series tried too hard to be serious that all characters end up sounding monotone.The harem also seemed so unnecessary.I enjoy watching trash fantasy anime, but unlike those that everyone expects to be story-less, slice of life anime, made only for entertainment, this one...had an actual story but the execution sucked."
"Tensei Kizoku, Kantei Skill de Nariagaru 2nd Season","I watched season one a while back. It was...fine, but painfully boring. Unfortunately this season is looking to be the same.Ars might as well be a blank piece of paper. He has no worldview other than...just being a nice noble. That's it. We barely even hear about how his past life influences him as a person, nor are we likely to in the future episodes, given that he has yet to even develop a personality. When it comes to ""Appraisal"", I thought it'd be a no brainer that the show challenges Ars on his ability to identify people who're one-of-a-kind in terms of 'stats' but...are just...conniving, horrible people that you don't want to use, since he's pretty complacent about this whole appraisal thing. Well, nope. Ars lucks out because every single of his picks turn out to be pretty decent people, including the informant who's head of a shady mercenary gang. Ars can't do much, but he does scream. Think Zenitsu from demon slayer but he stands around. Always. Forever, but gets the credit after Tanjiro and gang does the work because he ""picked them out"".The other characters are fun enough to be able to deliver a good scene or two, but nowhere are they entertaining enough to carry the many slice of life filler scenes injected into the series. For the story, they are not organic human beings whose experiences influence their worldview in ways that enhance or conflict with each other's, but rather a finite dispensary of backstory, giving Ars some opportunity to play saint so we get the illusion that he's less useless than he seems. After which, they become to blank slates, distinguishable only by some cursory traits and mannerisms attached to them.You may have the impression that the show deals with social issues. Uh...nope, that's been shattered since season 1. Retainer no.1 being of a discriminated race? Idk people like this one guy so happily ever after. Retainer no.2 almost got sold as a slave. Worry not, our rich young noble can simply pay the slave trader off, explaining to him that this way, he wouldn't endanger his reputation of letting his ""goods"" run off. So yup, he is indeed going on his merry way to treat more impoverished people like property, but it's 'out of sight, out of mind' for this show."
Sousou no Frieren,"Absurdist, melancholic, existential.These 3 traits make it one of the best and most unique anime in a setting that it is put in.The thought that we are watching a story after something that could've been the main story itself, we're watching a story after the end ofthe story.The cynicism and realism of a main character that isn't loud and obnoxious, she's a thousand years old of course she is the way she is.The way the women characters are written, none of that ecchi, lowkey p*do, harem, author's not so well hidden fantasies sh*t.The absurdist quirkyness of Frieren, everyone is...motivated by their own reasons - noble or senseless, it doesn't matter."
Ao no Hako,"If you ask a AI ""please make a romcom anime with sports setting"", don't be surprised if the result is Blue Box. If you are a sports anime fan, forget about it, because it's almost non-existent here. Instead, we got a generic romantic comedy, that just follow the genre most popular tropes instead of doing something barely inspired or original. I am not joking, because I already predicted the plot of the first few episodes by just taking a look at episode 1. That is how cliche it is.About the positive sides, Blue Box at least has a great animation, but it doesn't matter, because...you can give a poop a top-tier animation and by the end of the day, it will still be poop. That is what Blue Box is, a great animation with no substance at all."
"Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru.","I'm really disappointed for this anime, the start is fine but i gets worse and worser.  Before I review every aspect, I'd like to give my thoughts from the start until the ending. The story is fine and pretty unique ( not that mainstream but not that rare ), pretty much confusing for most people but I understand all of it from the start until end. The fact that the way they make things to rushes and not carefully on making such a scene, the way that makes this anime is even worser is that the characters in here. I want to give it...mixed feelings but definitely not recommended.Story : (6/10)The topic that comes in the story is pretty much good, It's sad that they make it cliffhanger and that makes the story in this season one is pretty bad, useless but not that useless. They focus more on characters, but the characters are worse and it doesn't come well. That makes the story pretty boring and can't catch up the feelings for us. And the evil organization doesn't interesting at all, It's like the beginning of the story because they don't give us more information for this part.Start : (7/10)As I said the start is pretty fine,  we know what they want and something like that. Nothing much I can complain about.Middle/conflicts: (2/10)They really messed up here by giving us disturbing things and a ""filler"" plot type thing, doesn't give efforts on the characters putting random characters in the most random time. i don't know what to said for this, how much I disappointed through middle of story and doesn't give us any information for the organization, lacking of characters, and much more. It's like they just gave us random useless episodesEnding : (5/10)The ending is fine and understandable but pretty much annoying at the same time. In the middle they show us like they made this anime for the bond build between Siesta and Kimizuka but in the end they just made Siesta died and gives the story to random characters with boring personality and useless in most aspects. This makes me even more disappointed and the fact that Kimizuka and Siesta goodbye is not emotional and felt SO BLAND.Characters : (4/10)Now, Kimizuka at first is a solid character and I find pretty relatable ( looking forward to his development ), sadly for me they make his character even worser for making him as someone who's everyone girls crush and literally copy paste personality like others romance MC but at the same time copy paste ""hero"" personality making him as basic MC that I hate. Okay, now let's take a look on side characters, they all are useless, they don't give any emotional part on story ( even their backstory are basic ) and their personality are trash. Not just that, they don't give any important thing and just messed up, their relationship with Kimizuka are messed up too, bad, and rushed. Even for the main too ( Natsu ). Siesta probably is the most interesting character here, It looks like the author really makes Siesta to become ""waifu"" typeGraphics : (6/10)It's okay, not that good but okay. The colors are okay, the characters too are okay. But they gave me a bland expression for the mc and the girls are okay but their personalities makes me dislike them. The animation is okay, but not a big fan of it.OP & ED :(5/10)The musics is basic and not memorable but they animation for the OP & ED are good and makes me okay with it.Overall :(4/10)I'm actually wanted to give 6 because the topic of the story is interesting but It just fell and yeah. I don't think this anime deserve 5, bc 5 are fine but it's just there. Meanwhile for this anime, I just can't get into it."
5-toubun no Hanayome∽,"Possibly one of the only specials to a series you can truly call special. While it is filled with some needless fan service and while it also might be just a two episode special, this is more of the phenomenal storytelling we gladly received in the second half if season two.I was waiting for Yotsuba’s background to be realized and was fairly disappointed with the minimal attention she was getting throughout the show, especially being the most emotionally compelling character in the show. This is exactly what I wanted to see in the past two seasons, and it is wonderfully delivered in a nostalgic,...stylistic way as typical of Shaft.Why couldn’t Shaft animate the whole show? This has possibly the best episode in the show and it’s just from their two episode run. Not only that, the opening and ending are wonderfully crafted. Alongside the already fantastic voice acting, Shafts stylistic touch adds so much more life to the show. Considering the flashback filled nature of this special, it’s no wonder Shaft is such an excellent choice. It all builds that nostalgia until we are left on the final depressing shot. I haven’t even got to mention the improvements with the soundtrack, there is much more care going into this show than I realized.There was no time wasted getting into the meat, and all we are left with is the tragic feeling of being alone. The final shot of Yotsuba on the swing was utterly brilliant. The urge to call out on your desires, do what you want to do, alongside the limits you set for yourself. She only wants her sisters to be happy, to keep a family happy. She looks over at the houses below and swings, alone.What a great special. A meticulously planned story of love. Don’t skimp out on these two episodes."
5-toubun no Hanayome ∬,"Similarly to the first season, this show gets better as it goes on. While this season is lacking the comedic quirks of the tutoring dynamic, it substitutes it with very good character development. These characters aren’t much more complex now than they were in season one.I was questioning whether this show was going to holdup, even with the production budget being increased. The first four episodes didn’t leave me expecting much, so I was blindsided once things picked up. Not only is it just a very entertaining romantic comedy with the nostalgic lover factor from Nisekoi, it’s an excellent showcase of sisterhood itself. We...dive straight into the ins and outs of being a quintuplet.While I never thought the quintuplets were bad characters before, the are much more humanistic in this season compared to before. We learn how they tick, and how their individuality is closely tied to the very fact they are quintuplets. Their comprehension of identity is very skewed, for some characters more than others at least. We also have an expansion of the main character as well. We didn’t see much of anything from the main character before, but he is much more alive this season.I never brought up the specifics of production, such as the voice acting and soundtrack. However, I now realize this show has some of the most natural and flowing voice acting i’ve heard from an animation. The soundtrack is your standard romantic comedy anime soundtrack, but the voice acting is so strong. I’m starting to believe everyone involved in this work is exceptionally talentedAll in all, we have very human characters being changed by a new love. Emotions that lead to hatred, betrayal, and forgiveness. The dysfunctionality within family, especially in the sister’s case. It’s a great show under the disguise of your standard seasonal garbage. Don’t be ashamed to pick this up."
Watashi no Shiawase na Kekkon,"I picked this anime up because it was my comfort genre, a period romance with a bit of magic and duels. what more could you want?But it far exceeded my expectations, both in terms of its writing and production.The story is yet another adaptation of a Cinderella-esque structure with an overpowered Male lead who swoops in to save the Female lead from the clutches of abuse and unhappiness. But here it diverts from the tropes a bit and we are presented with a story, although quite simple but more dramatic and political at its roots. It starts slow, but the story quickly picks up a...plot that spans a political motive, negotiations between noble families, and pretty good action set pieces for a romance-drama anime. The characters are simple, rememberable, and conveyed very aptly. I like that most of the screen time is given to exploring the Female lead and her perspective rather than other events that happen in tandem. I wish though, that we get more about the Male lead as well in the second season.The production is excellent. With the budget they were given, the studio has put out beautiful animated sequences and the character designs are pleasing to look at, to say the least. The sound design and the soundtrack itself are great as well. It lacks a bit in its thematic areas but overall the music goes pretty well in most of the episodes.It's a really easy watch for those who like this genre but I would not recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone not accustomed to the genre and its slow progression of plot. Eager to see how they improve in the second season.8/10"
Koi wa Ameagari no You ni,"A very moving and eye opening anime. It's well animated and immerses you into their world. I couldn't stop watching. I had to keep watching. I had to find out what happened, why it happened and the conclusion. This was a great romance anime.Despite my grudge against one character, the show was heartwarming. It's an interesting premise given the real world implications of their relationship, however I think the show carries it out well enough to not be weird. I'm usually not one romance anime but unless it's comedy but this one kept me coming back to watch episode after episode. It intrigued me...till the last episode.This is definitely a very interesting concept that I don't think has been done quite as well as this. Interesting, funny and a joy to watch."
Dandadan,"I have been hearing a lot about Dandadan and that got me interested in the show. It looked like 'the anime' that all the Youtubers were reacting to this season and it was also getting a ton of Karma on reddit as well. That got me hyped because the last time this happened, it was 'Frieren' which is a really good show, so I decided to watch Dandadan. To be very honest, I think the show isn't worth the hype it is getting. The fight scenes/choreography are cool, the animation is pretty nice too but other than that I couldn't see the appeal to it.My...main gripe with the show was that I just couldn't connect with the story, like at all! It all feels very random, including the villains who do not serve any purpose other than to make way for the protagonists to have either some cool scenes beating them or to show some weird moments which acts as a shock value for the audience. Now I can see how that is good in its own way but I have never personally liked that approach. Also, everything kind of feels predictable as hell. The characters seem to just have one-dimension to them and are pretty much unremarkable. Momo has a nice character design though so I will give you that hah! But then again, that becomes another point of criticism since I feel like the show leans a bit too much on fanservice with its female characters. Also, the show really lacks proper build up or explanation. The show just failed to get me to care about the characters.Now, coming towards the thing that a lot of people seem to love about the show. The Comedy or maybe I should say 'weird/cringy scenes' that have been disguised as quirky humor that just makes people go ""wtf is going on, this show is crazy lololol"" instead of actually building up a funny moment. There are so many shows that get you attached to the characters or the overarching plot and once that happens, the character interactions become funny/endearing on its own. Dandadan is just not about all that. A lot of the scenes are quite awkward 'fanservice moments' like some of those scenes of Momo with the aliens in the first episode. I know some people will justify those scenes and thats cool, however I just felt it was forced and didn't like it all that much.The other problem that I have with the show are the stakes or maybe I should say - the lack of it! No tension in the story whatsoever! You just know that this is the kind of story where people get thrown at concrete walls and survive it and act like nothing happened at the end of the episode. It just makes me feel like whatever danger the characters are in at the moment is all pointless since nothing is going happen anyway and there is no real danger. I felt that threats become a waste of time when this happens in a show.The one thing I really liked about the show was that Science Saru really cooked with the animation. I have always been a fan of their works and they have once again delivered. Although, I feel like their skill could have been used in some other show with more substance to it. Because Dandadan felt like a very shallow anime to me.Now I would like to say that this is all just my opinion and you might actually end up liking the show so I would say give it a shot if you have the free time. Now regarding how many episodes to watch, i would say watch the first episode and if you don't like it then you probably would not like the rest of it either. If you could not make up your mind after the first episode then just for your reference, the 4th and the 7th episodes are good and have some great moments in them but since I couldn't connect with the show whatsoever, I did not get blown away as much. Maybe you will. I am dropping this show after 7th episode even though it is what people consider to be one of the best chapters of Dandadan so I just know that this show is not for me.5/10"
Gyakusatsu Kikan,"It has some really cool military action scenes. With a cool spin on the future and how sci-fi adapts into the real world.But otherwise the plot is kind of not that interesting and there is a lot of dialogue that feels like filler. Just to stretch the movie out into a normal movie run time.The idea reminds me of Ghost In The Shell, and the world is also sort of going down that cyberisation route but it never really felt like any of how they arrived at where they are made any sense. It was all just very convenient."
Dantalian no Shoka,"Dantalian no Shoka or The Mystic Archives of Dantalian is an anime that I personally really wanted to love but just couldn't so I dropped it after 5 episodes. Still, regardless of whether or not I liked this anime it simply cannot be called a good watch. The flaws this show suffers from are fairly uncommon in the anime industry making it hard to say whether or not (you) the one reading this would like this show or not. So first here's my short general ""recommendation"" or ""advice"" I usually give in my reviews for those not wanting to read this whole thing.The simple...gist is this show was rushed as much as possible and because of that the plot is filled to the brim with holes and loads of stuff that doesn't make sense. If you like Dalian's personality of being a total tsundere that easily caves to sweet food, and likes books etc etc and don't care if all the dialouge and story is sped up by 20x and crammed into a space so small it's almost unwatchable then sure watch this if you have nothing better to do with your time. But I wouldn't recommend this show to basically anyone as it is.Well then going more in depth now let's talk about the story, characters and plot because they all suffer the same major problems. The plot and premise actually seems pretty good, Hugh's grandfather dies and in order to obtain his will he needs to manage his archives and take care of Dalian. Dalian is basically a being that holds the Bibliotheca Mystica de Dantalian or The Mystic Archives of Dantalian which essentially contains a massive amount of knowledge and information alongside ""forbidden knowledge"" found in Phantom Books. Which are dangerous books that can do many often problematic supernatural level things and Hugh and Dalian will often be sealing away said books in nearly every episode. Honestly this premise isn't bad and doing it in a episodic way like that isn't necessarily bad either. The problem is the ""story"" doesn't really go anywhere or have any meaning. Dalian and Hugh literally don't take on a main character type role to seal these away in the story, they literally just do it cause they can that's it. They have no reason or goal to do it and the story doesn't have a direction to go either. Every episode they just stumble across a Forbidden book here or there with some new character supposedly being involved and they seal away the book at the end. Now look this type of show CAN work but only when it's executed properly, Magic Kaito 1412 is a great example of one such show. But when every character we come across is insanely shallow and having no depth to them. Put it alongside the outright terrible writing that makes everything the characters speak feel rushed and like they're trying to dump 5 minutes worth of info onto us in just 1 minute. The entire premise was shoved into the first episode which involved the man who killed his grandfather. Neither of them even reacted in a human way to that fact, they're just like ""He's the man who killed Wesley"" with a straight face and normal tone and every episode after the first one is worse. The writing is so dang rushed all the characters can do is speak plot points and nothing else with the only exception being some of Dalian's food and book loving personality.The production quality is also pretty bad, putting aside the pacing, rushing and more story focused aspects of it. The art is often quite poorly drawn and very inconsistent so while it can at specific times look rather good it's more often than not looking like an anime from the 90s on VHS that was upscaled to a blurry high res digital variant that has poor detail and looks like mud half the time. Not even the animation can save it as many scenes have incredibly stiff and basic movement or even none at all. The music is decent and I actually really liked the opening song, but it's such a shame that it was paired with opening visuals that are totally out of place and don't fit in the least. The voice acting is fine, nothing great about it but nothing bad about it either and it's really held back by the script and writing more than anything.Overall this show is a total mess of a production that seemed like nobody working on it wanted anything more than to gloss over everything and rush every single aspect of the show as much as possible like they're trying to get an achievement for it or something. I honestly would rate this a 4/10 and tell you to watch a generic isekai instead however the plot and premise of this show weren't half bad and were something that I genuinely loved and wished we're done better. So I guess it can have a 5/10 but I still don't recommend it to anyone due to it's massive flaws. I might update this review later if I ever decide to come back to this and finish it but at this point that's rather unlikely."
Tsue to Tsurugi no Wistoria,"Wistoria: A Slow Start with Promising PotentialI began watching Wistoria with very low expectations, initially writing it off as a repetitive and uninspired anime. The only reason I gave it a chance was because the original work was written by the same author behind DanMachi, an anime adaptation I’ve been avidly following. That connection was enough to make me curious about another one of their works.The premise is straightforward and, admittedly, overused in the genre: a weak student tries to compensate for his lack of magical talent by excelling in academics. While he consistently scores high on written tests, he fails miserably in practical exercises,...which require an innate ability for magic—something he simply doesn’t possess.The setting is also a classic trope: a magical academy. While this isn’t inherently a flaw, it becomes problematic when the protagonist stands out not because of any unique abilities but because he relies solely on a sword. He uses this singular weapon for both defense against spells and offense against monsters in a dungeon—another trope that feels overplayed unless explored with greater depth. Unfortunately, Wistoria treats these elements rather superficially.The supporting cast and side characters are similarly stereotypical. There’s the snobbish classmate, the girl with a crush on the protagonist, the strongest student in the class, and the rival with whom the protagonist often clashes in magical battles. Even the professors feel derivative, such as Professor Edward, who seems to be a nod to Severus Snape from Harry Potter. However, despite these clichés, the characters are decently written and gradually fleshed out—something not to be taken for granted given the anime's overall standard.The series does have its highlights, especially during moments where the protagonist, Will, shines through sheer determination and dedication. Unfortunately, these moments are few and far between, and their placement throughout the series feels uneven. The climax, which arrives far too late, barely saves the anime by providing a satisfying, albeit overdue, turning point.The uneven pacing is one of the show’s major flaws. Action sequences that showcase Will’s resolve and growth are poorly distributed, making the story feel heavy at times. This lack of consistency diminishes the anticipation for what’s next; some episodes feel predictable, while others fail to leave the viewer intrigued or curious about future developments.This inconsistency is unfortunate because, for those who persevere through the slower parts, the final episodes reveal several intriguing hints of potential for future seasons. These late developments suggest that Wistoria could evolve into something much stronger if the series capitalizes on its newfound momentum.While Wistoria struggles with overused tropes and pacing issues, it’s not entirely without merit. The protagonist's moments of brilliance and the groundwork laid for future plotlines hint at a more engaging story down the road. However, it’s a tough sell for those unwilling to push through its rocky start. For now, Wistoria remains a middling addition to the magical academy genre, with the hope that future installments can fully realize its potential."
Ranma ½,"Note: this is a review of the first season only, I will not watch the second season since from the times when I watched Rupan Sansei Part II in its original japanese - I.E. True - form I don't particularly like children-leaning ca$hgrabs of the prolonged kind, as clearly the second season was intended from the get-go if its terribly downgraded animation is of any indication.Before I start, let me preface that, contrary to a lot of people in the tokusatsu fandom who don't like him because they want their tokusatsus to be live-action renditions of Dragon Ball, I am a big Toshiki Inoue...fan (he's currently my third favourite superhero writer of all times). I adore his style of perfectily meshing shoujo storytelling clearly inspired by the titans of the genre like Riyoko Ikeda (you'll always find something quoting Versailles No Bara in both his animes and tokus, think of the French Revolution in Choujin Sentai Jetman or the Yume No Kakera-Romantico tune from Kamen Rider Faiz being reminescent of the 1979 anime intro) and Walt Disney (I'm referring to the lovely Disney Princesses mentioned in every single work of his), subtle social critique concerning the bad results of the mix between the public sphere and the corporate world on the life of the common people (the taxes in Cutie Honey The Live and Ranma 1/2, the accountant at the start of Changerion, the inept soldiers in Tekkoku Mikazuki to name a few of those suggestions), inspiring philosophy concerning the importance of hoping for a shining light to keep us going in the worst moments (maybe inspired by his turbulent relationship with his father, the hack who almost destroyed the Kamen Rider IP during the Showa era with crap like the 1971 Kamen Rider and the nonsensically uberoverrated V3), sexual fanservice that does its job PERFECTLY without feeling forced or contrived and psychedelic imagery you would normally associate with people like Kunihiko Ikuhara or Hideaki Anno, and I adore it even more considering that Toshiki Inoue's style apparently is a direct continuation of the suggestions put forward by none other than the father of the Toei Superhero Tokusatsus Shotaro Ishinomori, at least if we consider the Shoujo-leaning, socially-critical stuff present in Ishinomori's own tokusatsus Seinun Kamen Machineman and Kaiketsu Zubat. For this reason, priorly to watch this series I tried to get into one of the guy's first work as the main writer, the insanely popular (in Japan only, of course) and insanely boring barring Inoue's own style Yawara: a fashionable judo girl, a series that, despite having prototypes of the love triangle present in Choujin Sentai Jetman and scenes reminiscent of Avataro Sentai Donbrothers, was boring because the hack who made the original manga tried to make an ill-concieved parody of spokons with an unrelatable, uber-perfect Mary Sue with genius parents, the kind of which you can find in the terrible Go: Princess Precure anime I previously reviewed on this same site. Luckily, this time around, there are no stupid Mary Sues to speak of so, if you're a fan of Inoue, you can fully appreciate his style once again and you can see elements that will end in his Masterpieces, particularly Changerion and the excellent Cutie Honey the live, as well you will see the Sukeban series influences he mentioned in the 99% perfect Avataro Sentai Donbrothers movie (the best live-action superhero movie of the last thirty years together with the equally excellent Kamen Rider Faiz 20th Anniversary movie, the MCU and DCEU crap can eat it all day all night to him) in the form of the black rose lady, a character which is reminescent of antagonists present in series made a few years before this anime was made like Tenshi No Uppercut and Sailor Fuku Hangyaku Doumei. That said, it's not 100% perfect and not as great as the first part of Death Note (which was penned by the same person) nor as great as his tokusatsus Masterpieces like Kamen Rider Kiva (The best Kamen Rider of all times IMHO), Changerion itself, Cutie Honey The Live, The beforementioned movies etc. etc. but still very good nonetheless, Kamen Rider Agito, Faiz and Shougeki Gouraigan level of good (yes, I liked even the latter, I couldn't care less of the naysayers). So, if you're a Toshiki Inoue fan like me, you will find more pleasure in the first Ranma 1/2 series than in the entirety of Yawara: a fashionable Judo Girl, hence I recommend going down on the former and leave the latter untouched. On a technical side, the animation in this series at least is still very clear and well done, the chara is excellent (particularly the female ranma is as loveable and sexy as it can get, I'm sorry for my first anime crush ever Shampoo - for whom I will always have soft spot nonetheless - but the female ranma takes the cake in all aspects) and the voice acting is stellar, with veterans like Megumi Hayashibara and Kikuko Inoue making a performance as spotless as it can get. The 20 - 21 including the final recap - episodes of the Ranma 1/2 anime (NOT Nettohen NOR the completely useless 2024 remake, both of which I couldn't care less even if I tried) are highly recommended from me.And to Toshiki Inoue, if you ever read this review, I love you Maestro. Don't care one bit of the haters, they don't deserve you."
Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"Not really spoiling any details, just some general very general comments regarding the direction so far.I will keep it simple. Watch it!As I am writing this there are 3 other reviews: two positive, one negative. There is no point in rewriting what they wrote. The pros and cons are pretty accurate up to episode 3. However, were on episode 6 now. It's not only continued to excel at at all the good things mentioned in other reviews, but it addresses all the issues the negative review had. This is definitely more than a ""easy watch"". It starts out slow and fun, but things are...starting to be explained. The comedy and plot balance has greatly improved after the first few episodes. You won't have to wait 12 episodes to figure out the plot. The age requirements and the history is all dealt with by episode 6. The action scenes are both fun and serious, and well done for this type of anime ( this isn't an action anime, yet it definitely treated the more serious fighting scene in episode 6 with care and appropriate weight, especially compared to the rest of fighting so far. )I wont spoil too much. Watch it, its going uphill. Will update when the season ends, but I have high hopes. This is definitely headed towards becoming one of my favorites / top anime for this season."
"Shijou Saikyou no Daimaou, Murabito A ni Tensei suru","Pros: . No real slice of life lessons, but they are some ridiculous moments that deserve a chuckle or two.Average: Music and artCons: Horribly boring written plot. Extremely cliche fan service overpowered but never acknowledges it cuz he is so overpowered since before the anime. All girls love him, succubus, powerful(relatively) girl.No action, everything is just flash and done. Sometimes it is side character ineffective flash, then main character OP flash and done. Occasionally the main character will make up a new flash and done. There is no actual challenge. There is no real romance. The biggest obstacle is keeping the secret of his...reincarnation but honestly even if the characters will say it is a big deal, within one save the world moment it will be no big deal for anyone."
Asatte Dance,"They went ham on the harmonica.I would’ve just posted that, MAL said there needs to be more information so :/ Poor animation, flat characters, an OST consisting mostly of a lone harmonica. (not gonna lie, that's kind of charming, but it's also grading for episodes that're 40 minutes long.) Just kind of a whole lot of nothing; I can't blame anyone on production since they probably had a shoestring budget. I didn't know anything going into it; Just stumbled upon this by chance while perusing MAL. If you want to see poorly animated sex scenes, and things just kind of happening, then give it a...watch, but there's probably something more engaging you could be spending your time on."
Little Busters!,"TLDR: It's so close to a masterpieceThis review will be based on both seasons of Little BusterStory 9/10If you want more content like Angel Beats this is an alternative version of it. It started off very similar like Angel beats where the story is average but if you give it enough time, especially towards a specific episode it gets insanely emotional, especially the second season. The story is about a group of childhood friends that has made a baseball club called Little Busters and throughout the seasons they are recruiting more members into their club. The first season is very easy to follow and does...not give any complexity to the narrative until you reach certain characters where they dive deeper into the character's backstory which offers a great amount of emotional content. Season 2 is where the REAL game starts. That is where most of the content starts to depart from the comedic and light-heartedness element of season 1 and starts to focus more on the complexity and physiological element. It get's so emotional to the point that it'll make you cry that's for sure and there is a lot of mystery that will eventually be answered the more you invest into it.Characters 8/10The characters is a lot better compared to Angel Beats. Angel Beats simply didn't give enough context for most of its characters however Little Busters gives a lot more content and no one feels left out. What is important is that it does not feel rushed and most of its characters have shown great depth in their background story and perspective at the same time. However, towards the second season, most of the characters that are outside the original Little Buster mostly felt left out, but to compensate for it they did offer a massive amount of content from them in season 1. Overall its not bad on how they showed their characters and each of them has a fair amount of screen time.Animation 7/10The animation for Little Buster is good. You will not see any badly drawn parts throughout the series. There is occasional CGI from time to time but doesn't destroy the series.Music 10/10Trust me, if you love angel beats music you will love this as well. It's very soft and simplistic music that is played throughout the series which adds even more emotions to the sad part.ConclusionOverall, this series is on par with the Angel beats storytelling where at first starts off average but the more you invest into it the more emotional and better it gets. The animation is good with some occasional CGI and the music has a soft yet emotional touch towards it. The characters in this series is better than Angel Beats as it offers more content and perspective from each of its characters which gets very emotional."
Akiba Meido Sensou,"Originally when I had stumbled onto Akiba Maid Wars, I was pulled in by the gimmicky feel of it. I was entirely under the assumption that the frosting would match the cake; That this was just a parody of the mafia trope with the maid cafe trope.I was entirely wiped away by the plot that slowly seeped itself in after the initial few episodes, however, as the show moved from parody to heartwrenching.Other reviews claim that the show relies too heavily on it's tropes, but rather I think it is to be believed that the show is better because of it. Is it...sappy and silly at times? Absolutely. But does it also contribute to the world building, the kind of world where maid yakuzas rule Akihabara in the entirety of the 18th century? An undeniable and resounding yes, yes, yes.The plot and twists are the spectacular reason this show squeezed its way onto my favorites list (not to mention the art style is gorgeous!). Really I feel the lower points of the show have to do with developing and understanding the other girls that work in the cafe. All characters that had critical plot points felt presented enough and gradually developed through the show, but the co-workers really didn't get much substance after their individual ""introduction"" episodes. It's a shame because if the show had more episodes, I truly believe it had the capacity to be a ten.That is not the case, though. The characters (in all manners they are presented) are delightful, fun, and unique! All the twists were genuinely shocking and unexpected! The story and especially the ending had me crying for several hours! The last episode post credit scene makes you feel so many emotions, you might throw up.I don't see most casual anime watches disliking this very much. At the very least it might be a funny thought in the back of your head. 100% enjoyable!"
Death Note,"Death Note has a creative plot with many twists and turns, telling the story of student Light Yagami who discovers a notebook with the power to kill anyone who writes their name in it. When Detective L is introduced, a game of cat and mouse begins. It's the type of anime that I would recommend for any type of person to watch, the themes covered here are very well in-depth and explored despite being a short and objective series. The anime leads us to reflect on the characters' moral dilemmas and excitedly follow where everything will end. Death Note is the ideal choice for lovers...of suspense and mystery and why not for lovers of philosophy."
Dandadan,"Masterpiece 10/10I really dont get the mixed feeling people are having, this is the best anime of the season, and im watching 27 of them.If you cant see how amazing this anime is you either havent watched it, watched a few out of context clips, you maybe you didnt go past episode one.Animation 10/10Soundmix 10/10Story 10/10Very refreshing anime, all the negantiveness ive seen is from people who in a casual conversation would say ""you dont know my traumas or triggers"". And you shouldnt listen to what anyone has to say, just give it a few episodes, i was hooked from the 1st, ive wauw'ed, laughed...and cried (eps 7 broke me, i cant even... i stared at the wall for 5-10 min after it ended)Overall, watch it, do it now.... Why are you still reading this, just do it"
Look Back,"For a short oneshot story, it has a certain something to it. It didn't make me cry, but the story touched my heart. Finding the reason why you do something and why you are passionate about it. Look Back changed me in a very satisfying way.The art and animation style are very fluid and faithful to Fujimoto's work. It feels very refreshing and smooth.The soundtrack is also amazing. It immerses you in the story and resonates with the exact situations.It's not a story of fights or adventure, romance or comedy. It's a cute but tragic story of two ordinary girls. And that's what makes...it highly enjoyable.Highly recommended."
Happy Sugar Life,"In the introduction to Piero Camporesi's The Juice of Life, Umberto Eco talks about the kind of disgust elicited by the carnal morbidity of the former author's scholarship on the medieval conception of the body; he compares binging on Camporesi to swimming in a pool full of human waste, or a pool full of cake batter, both of which, after a time, would be equally repulsive. If Happy Sugar Life has any unique contribution as a piece of media, it's in the way it can elicit that latter kind of disgust, of being overwhelmed to the point of nausea by something cloyingly sweet.Approaching the show...as a standalone piece, the criticism comes pretty easily. It takes the now-trite image from Nabokov of the solipsistic pedophile constructing a fantasy which does immeasurable harm when it intersects with the real world and applies the least challenging anime plot formula to it: the main character encounters rival solipsistic pedophiles and battles against them to keep her status quo. There's no real attempt at character exploration, no psychology, no engagement with the idea it implicitly raises that categories of sex object and objectifier are porous. It's pure exploitation, and the best one can say for it on that front is that the appeal is largely in the exaggerated menhera personalities of the cast and not really in vicarious access to the younger of the two principal characters.As an adaptation of a preexisting manga, though, I can't think of any better approach to doing Happy Sugar Life. There's a focus on keeping things light and fast-moving, on maintaining a tone of high-energy absurdity. It's pop where it could have been overwrought, and my only really complaint is that it doesn't go quite pop enough, isn't that free of an adaptation, when it really could've supported something along the tonal lines of Re: Cutie Honey or Gainax's other work of that era.The best way to experience Happy Sugar Life, though, isn't really watching the show or reading the manga, it's watching the OP: pretty much everything you might get out of the full package is there. Bringing a cheeky mug to the office that says ""This Anime Could've Been a Vocaloid MV""."
Dandadan,"As you watch the show, there will definitely be a lot of concerns that will arise as you go through the first few episodes. The adaptation is jam-packed with style from the get go, but the substance takes a bit to take shape.I know I sound pretentious, but what Dandadan is really good at is BALANCE, from the wacky antics, to grounded character interactions, to somber and emotionally mature moments. Nothing truly over stays it’s welcome.Most of your issues you will likely have with the show will be fixed as you delve deeper into Dandadan.However, if you really, really dislike Dandadan’s humor, then it most...likely isn’t for you. But if you are fine with it even if you don’t dig it, there are still a lot more to enjoy."
Unnamed Memory,"I decided to write this because this anime has a really low score for what it is and most of the reviews are from people who have not finished all episodes.That being said here's what I think:The anime does have a lot of random and unexplained time skips with the characters talking about things you did not see onscreen, many of the side characters do not get any development or backstories. It is that way so the screen time can be focused on what happens to the development of the relationship between the main characters. You do get to see what they've been through together...and why they would think or act a certain way due to the things that have happened.This is a world of magic and fantasy, but the story is not about the world or wars or fights for the throne. It is about the witch and the prince and every episode gets their relationship a bit closer to the last episodes where it all gets wrapped together in a very polarizing way that I personally don't prefer but understand why It ended in such a way.This is DEFINITELY not for everyone to enjoy but if you like a slow burner with a beautiful ending and you are on the fence due to the score this anime has I STRONGLY recommend you give it a shot."
Fate/Extra: Last Encore,"Again, it’s really disappointing to give this only three stars, but for completely different reasons than Fate/Apocrypha. There’s a lot of potential here, and it’s all squandered by low budget and poor writing, I really hate to see it. I think if this had the production value of Kizumonogatari then it could’ve lived up to be a worthy successor to Fate/stay night.The main selling point of this series is its poster girl: Nero Claudius (Saber). And she’s great! This is impressive given she’s the third gender-bent blonde saber class heroic spirit in the history of the Fate TV anime franchise. I think she’s different...enough from Artoria and Mordred, the decision to make her a woman was purely cosmetic and more a Fate cliche, than the comment about gender dysphoria and patriarchy that her predecessors took on. Instead, we have all the extravagance and aesthetics of Emperor Claudius in an overtly feminine heroine sporting a dress clearly inspired by Mireille Darc. She’s cute, she’s funny, has great chemistry with the rest of the cast, and her monologues are inspiring.The soundtrack is pretty awesome and so are the ending visuals.Unfortunately, that’s where the solid elements of the series end. The animation is poor; it is just disappointing time and time again. Here and there you’ll find a standout sequence or keyframe, but that’s really it. And knowing the potential of Studio Shaft, it’s all the more disappointing. The rest of the cast is patchy, Hakuno has a super interesting character concept, but it’s never articulated as well as it could be. Alice is the same. Rin and the rest of the former FSN cast are great, but they’re characters we’ve seen before, we know their stories, and they never deliver any performances in this series that outlive FSN. The rest of the cast is unworthy of mention; they are just throwaway characters. And the fight choreography is terrible, really really terrible, I don’t understand how the team performed so poorly in that aspect.I truly wish this was a better adaptation."
Fate/Apocrypha,"It really sucks to give this a six, considering how great some of these episodes are. For every compelling character, beautiful fight scene, and interesting exchange, there's also a lot of boring material. There are simply too many characters here, many of whom are poorly written and drag down every scene they take part in. (Not to mention Jack the Ripper, whoever did that character design is a damn pedophile, and the character itself sucks too). Astoflo, Achilies, Chirion, Siegfried, Mordred, and Kairi are the lifeblood of this series, but their potential, and the whole work itself, are squandered by poor writing."
"Ore wa Subete wo ""Parry"" suru: Gyaku Kanchigai no Sekai Saikyou wa Boukensha ni Naritai","Like I said in my ""interest stack"", this show has an interesting premise ruined by the writer's inability to write a MC that grows in any interesting manner whatsoever.Till the beginning to the end, MC acts like a moron. It goes from ""charming"" to ""is he retarded?"" when he keeps mistaking every situation for what it isn't. He even encounters the enemy leader clad in gold and his first response is, ""What is this old guy doing here wearing all gold?"" Dear lord, this isn't charming. You have to be touched in the head to find this shtick entertaining for more than two episodes.I swear...most anime is just this on a loop. A good premise, ruined by some average writer.Ignoring the obvious flaws with the character development, the visuals are surprisingly good and the action is fun. I actually liked that the MC didn't have a harem of bimbos drooling over him 24/7 as well. As long as MC doesn't act special, he's a likable nice guy, not some OP prick.If there is ever a season 2, I would just like them to tone down the bimbo levels and make the MC live in the real world for a change. But then, it kinda feels like the entire premise is based around the MC being aloof and ""being able to parry everything"", so not sure if the writer can make the season 2 interesting without them both. I mean, if the MC isn't an idiot, he would've been able to work hard and learn new skills other than parry, and not waste time cleaning gutters for a living.Anyway, 6/10, enjoyable enough despite the flaws."
Kuromi's Pretty Journey: Hacha Mecha! Multiverse Daidasshutsu!,"No spoilers in this review :3Honestly not recommended to anybody at all. The colours are actually pretty nice; animation is limited but clean and never unpleasant to look at, but it's just so lobotomizing and tedious despite the 80 second episode runtime. I don't know how they do that! At 1.5x speed it's a little better, just in the sense that it's bearable plus it goes so quick you can liberate yourself from hearing it's nasty, horrid dialogue by tuning out with greater efficiency, but that's no way to treat a show you enjoy, is it? Because you don't enjoy this show.Has this gross human...male character who's either the worst husbando bait imaginable or exists to provide an audience conduit, and I seriously hope it's not the latter because imagine wanting to date Kuromi..ew. She's like 1 foot tall there's basically no woman there!! But honestly I think he, like every other element of this show, is just part of the script to this nasty, nasty however many episode advertisement, a list of requirements given to its creators that cannibalise any chance at all to make ""art"" (whatever that is) in this godforsaken industry. The characters make goofy faces or whatever so you can screencap them and tweet them at your 12 followers, and this will sell merch I guess.I haaaate Kuromi, she's so annoying especially since her whole personality exists to market to a certain demographic; she's so cringe and insufferable and...ugh!!! I hate her!!!!!!!!!! If she was real I would take a hammer to her skull immediately, and I'm normally against animal cruelty :/ Just goes to show what media can do to someone.Okay reading this back I feel kind of sad, I just imagined a hypothetical fan of this show who actually likes Kuromi and all her empty ""character traits"", and smiles at all the merchandise on screen. I'm sorry to that viewer!! I don't mean to invalidate anyone's experiences >_<"
Koe no Katachi,"I want to start by saying, before anything else, just jump in head first into this film. That is what I did, and it is what I hope others may do going forward. When I say, that I have a deep and profound appreciation for this movie, that fails to properly grasp the true extent my first experience gave me. I am very easily enthralled by fiction, but this was unlike anything I'd ever experienced before. For the first time, after completing a movie or TV show, I was left with this odd sense of belonging. Nothing has been as encapsulating, and yet so profound...and mysterious all at once. The smallest of details all culminating to form what I can only describe as a cascade of events, each one more heart-wrenching or soul filling as the last. This above all else is a movie about forgiving the past, and the effect of old wounds, and as someone who struggles a lot with a lot of the problems the movie tackles I can really see just how realistic these characters are, this movie does a true justice to what it means to heal, and what it means to be hurt, do yourself a favor and check the movie out, then do it again to see how things change for you the second go around."
Fruits Basket 1st Season,"I would just like to keep this short....this is my first ever reviewThis anime was just flat-out boring, and the characters felt off. There were a few moments where I felt emotionally connected, but overall, the pacing was slow. The plot is small, but it was stretched across too many episodes, which made it hard to stay interested.I feel like people watch it because of the hype, but just because someone else likes it doesn’t mean everyone will, or that we should pretend to like it too. The anime lacks excitement, and after a while, it’s easy to lose interest because nothing seems...to happen.They rely too much on emotional scenes, which eventually feel repetitive and even cringe-worthy. The character introductions were unnecessarily long, and they lost my attention right from the start. They could have made this into a few episodes and kept it to a single season.It honestly could have been wrapped up in a short season or just skip most unnecessary episodes which is like most of them!!!"
Isekai Nonbiri Nouka,"This one is like the gentle murmurs and tranquil flow of a forest stream amidst the howling and screaming turmoil of the world. A safe fantasy full of hope where everyone is free to live a fulfilled and happy life. Farming Life in Another World (Isekai Nonbiri Nouka) is a fairy tale of the ""happily ever after"" variety, uplifting and inspiring.Exactly like a fairy tale it invites to a dive into the possibilities. What if one would discover and just follow this one true desire of the heart? Maybe a life filled with companionship, attainment and, yes, peaceful happiness? A life in which everyone is...welcome to be a part and share, and those who fear only do so because they have not yet allowed themselves to discover their own true desire.Now, cutting through the dreamy poetics and touching ground: why recommend but only rate 6?To me the show is not memorable at all. The art, ambience and story execution are all ""ok"", pleasant enough but certainly nothing to remember.I still recommend Farming Life because, seriously, we all could do with a big dose of peaceful happiness.If you're easily bored watch it while doing something else. I did main content all 12 episodes and enjoyed the warm and fuzzy feeling it created."
Ice,"Must be watched dubbed. The most manic, tonally-confused show I've ever seen. Perfect pacing, not a moment of wasted time, simultaneously hits every conventional anime narrative beat and yet manages to feel wholly unique. Proceeds less like a plot than a series of thematically-linked ideas, every scene and character that might have occurred to writers is worked in. I spent most of the show in disbelief that the main couple was, in fact, the main couple: they're such an intense aesthetic mismatch and no clear motivation for their feelings beyond Yuki Ice-T's offer of gratitude-sex. Oh, to have been the fly on the wall when...they told the AKB48 idol that she'd play a character throwing herself at a reticent butch supersoldier who wields both a gunblade and a six-foot railgun, to the annoyance of her yandere goth sister who graphically beats her."
Dandadan,"Like Hell's Paradise, Dandadan gets a lot of attention amongst recent shonens because both authors were former assistants to Chainsaw Man's Tatsuki Fujimoto and there are some mildly novel touches: HP has an unusual setting and, yeah, that's probably about it; meanwhile, Dandadan, well, uh... is basically a battle shonen that takes the standard otaku-pandering incel romance you'd find in school-based romcoms and pushes it into becoming the ultimate piss-take snub of self-insert pandermancy and cuck romance shippers that has increasingly become the norm in anime. There's a lot of humor, and almost all the punchlines hit below the belt, which probably won't go well...for those who aren't too keen on lowbrow jokes centering around, in this case, dick jokes—""Give me your banana"" (please don't). The whole series is simply one humongous dick joke (likely a petite one, if we're talking about the MC and his 5 cm kintamas that just dropped), and there probably isn't any other kind of media that sorely needed this passionate kick to the nuts more. The series effectively plays a savage South Park-styled game of Roshambo with self-inserters, as Dandadan's motto when it comes to our MC is ""Give us your balls, your dick, we'll make you a eunuch."" If you're not ""too mature"" for a few dick jokes, it can be amusing, but other attempts at humor aren't as smoothly integrated, such as milking the ""I finally noticed she's cute"" trope.What might appear at first to be a mere acknowledgement of the average anime functioning as a feel-good waifubait simulator for unwashed otakus who skitter about in the shadows, where a 10/10 moeblob who is way out of his league will throw herself upon him without any effort, for she has seen his true inner beauty and manages to look past surface details like BO, and he'll sweep her off her feet, whispering arcane lore into her ear about the intricate plot developments of the final arc of LotGH, becomes a surprisingly hilarious mockup of these kind of series. Instead of just making jokes about being neutered or spayed or presenting a pathetic low-t dweeb with his balls in the usual vice-grip, the series literally emasculates him by having almost the entire plot revolve around a high-speed chase to recover his stolen family jewels, with his dutiful gyaru love interest checking every nook and cranny, searching high and low, to recover his missing balls! In a way, it almost resembles a demented sexual misadventure version of Dragon Balls, with various characters vying for control of the protagonist's balls, which grant them power! One episode is even titled ""Like, Where Are Your Balls?"" The thing about a lot of shonen is that that's often one of my burning questions about the protagonist, but Dandadan does its own ball count, allowing one to save valuable mental energy.While not especially deep and just as accessible as most shonen, Dandadan at least foregoes one of the mistakes of its mature™ seasonal peer, Orb: My God Heliocentrism, Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?, a series so inept as to pose the question ""DUUUUHHH, what be subtext?"" and then proceeds to turn all of its subtext into straight-up dialogue and double down on making sure the audience doesn't miss a single thing. Dandadan doesn't feel the need to shamelessly go balls deep down that scandalous hole (kind of hard when they're missing), even if it's waving its influences right in our face in the same way an exhibitionist might flash his private parts. To get the balls rolling, there is blatant influence from the Egyptian Osiris myth (which also influenced Dionysus and various other repackaged gods and syncretized religions). The MC can be seen as Osiris and the FMC as Isis. Seth kills and dismembers Osiris, splitting his body into 14 pieces (in reference to the Orion constellation), leading to what could be referred to as the Mystery of the Missing Phallus (sometimes Mystery of the Missing Balls in the case of Dandadan, though the Phallus gets misplaced often as well). Each piece of Osiris has a partial amount of power, much as a few characters in Dandadan unlock dormant powers by fondling one of the MC's golden balls. Isis tracks down all the pieces of Osiris, except for the phallus, which was eaten by either a fish or crab, depending on which version of the story you read, with Turbo Granny being associated with a crab. Isis reconstructs the body, and there are different accounts of what happens: She usually uses her powers to craft him a new penis, fashions a foreign object into one, or even constructs a literal lady boner out of her own flesh and grafts it onto Osiris. Soon after, they give birth to Horus. Since she's a dickball stealer, Turbo Granny could loosely be seen as a Seth-like character, and there is even a part in the legend where Horus and Seth race each other on boats, much like how she challenges tunnel trespassers to a race; though she does have a more interesting dynamic with the main characters in this story, starting as an enemy, becoming a comic relief mascot, and maybe even something like a friend, though always scheming, not unlike Ekubo/Dimple from Mob Psycho 100. There's also, of course, the fixation on occultism and the sky (aliens), with the ancients being deeply invested in the sky and many of their practices now falling under what we call the occult. Anyway, this lengthy digression is meant to showcase that the author put a surprising amount of effort into presenting his NTR fetish.Admittedly, some of the cuck pandering can become hardcore, even cringe-inducing. At first, it doesn't seem all that heavy because after the alien-obsessed MC and the ghost/supernatural-believing FMC send each other off on a dare, the series plays out like a balls to the wall boss rush for several episodes, as the characters try to harness their powers and are attacked by one enemy after another. But once we finally have some downtime, like in episode 5, the MC goes back to his pity party lines, hoping his mommy—I mean, waifu—will save him. When the MC transforms he'll do some kind of clownish self-deprecating rap, but then he'll be moping at school and dropping lines like, ""Is it so embarrassing to be friends with me? WAAAAAAH!"" There's also an over-reliance on downer internal monologues around this time, and during the oddly synchronized yin-yangish bit between the couple, she'll be thinking stuff like, ""Ungh, I'm so bored. I wish Okarun would teach me all about aliens, especially the anal probing part. *____*"" Feels ridiculously pandering and almost out of tune with the blue balls pit that the show tends to dive headfirst into otherwise. That aspect of the series feels better motivated or smoother in earlier episodes. Of course, once we realize his balls are missing, his pathetic behavior kind of seems justified. You have to wonder if the author planned it a bit where the MC is subtly more or less pathetic depending on those circumstances. Probably not, but using his balls as a plot device allows material that would be far more embarrassing in other anime to roll far more smoothly here. It's also worth noting that the MC is not a total doormat and will insult the FMC when she insults him, instead of just taking abuse, like too many MCs for me to name.Thankfully, Crappa, the most hardcore corner-cutters in the industry, having churned out Chainsaw Man, Jujutsu Kaisen, Hell's Paradise, and many other extremely popular shonen in the last few years, didn't get their grimy hands on this series. I had read up to about episode 2-3 in the Dandadan manga back when it had first surged in popularity, and, while it seemed alright, there wasn't anything about it that kept me reading it over whatever else. Science SARU, handling the series instead, is a company that tends to have impressive animation or a distinct aesthetic but has put out a lot of mediocre or questionable titles and has been disconcertingly cozy with Netflix. One of their biggest manga adaptations a while back, Devilman: Crybaby, was a travesty for quite a few fans of Go Nagai's work or the earlier OVAs and probably not to the liking of those who were more interested in SARU for artsier titles either, like Inu-Ou. But SARU were actually a great choice for adapting Dan, appearing to be faithful where it counts, and featuring far more lively animation than we can usually hope to get from most seasons, with the first episode being quite inventive and even ""trippy,"" and the chase with the crab having a frenetic energy, as they run around and swing across buildings, struggling to survive. There are some disappointing stills that are occasionally used and expected dips in quality from time to time, but how polished it generally is is an indicator that SARU might actually be able to pull off the dream of adapting decent commercial work with their own unique style to generate revenue, while creating more artistic and experimental work along the way, as seemed to be the intention back when Masaaki Yuasa founded the company. This is an adaptation that mostly elevates the material, though there is a dubious ghettoization habit on display, which SARU has likely developed from being so close to Netflix (see the oddly placed rap in Japan Stinks 2020 and Devilman: Crybaby), rendering the audio component less than satisfactory."
Trillion Game,"Imagine this like an anime adaptation of Shark Tank. Two guys with complementary skills, the techie and the popular, join together to start a company about... well, they don't know themselves, but they find out on their way, right?This anime does a great job of portraying business situations and startup life, and goes pretty realistic except for some comedy moments and exaggerations.This show is for you if either of the below apply to you:- you love businesses and entrepreneurship- you want to see people that grind for their dreams, working hard no matter what- you enjoy seeing well-developed adult characters interacting in business settings-...you're looking for a story that's slice of life, comedy and yet still action packed at the same timeThe story is captivating and well-paced, sometimes serious, but most of the times quite light-heartedThe characters are decently developed, although nothing too deepThe animation is good, but not top tier"
Cider no You ni Kotoba ga Wakiagaru,"*No spoilers*SummaryWords Bubble Up Like Soda Pop tells the tale of two teenagers who work through their insecurities as they connect with one another. The movie explores topics such as neurodiversity, communication, and insecurities, with some wholesome intentions, young romance, and friendship. The story explores these themes with success, wrapping up with a pleasant ending and incorporating characters and a simple plot that slice-of-life fans will enjoy. In this way, it homes in on insecurities in a way that is likely relatable and palatable for teenagers. However, it is not a ground-breaking story, and it does not deeply examine these themes. I recommend this film...for its entertainment, pleasant, and “chill” approach to addressing the topics, though it is not revolutionary.Story: 7/10The story is unpretentious, and this simplicity keeps the viewer intrigued without exploring dark topics. In a way, this maintains a slice-of-life feel while also exploring some challenging themes, such as insecurities, neurodiversity, and relationships. There are plenty of shows, movies, and novels that explore these themes in more depth, although some are more effective and some fall short when compared to Words Bubble Up Like Soda Pop. The main characters, Smiles and Cherry, each have their own insecurities and challenges with communication which is evident in the opening scenes. From there, they mix up their belongings and end up developing a friendship. The story follows these two, as well as the side characters, as they support one another and help an elderly man find a certain record. The pacing is slow at the start, and there are times where some more development could have been used (see characters), but the plot sticks to a rather linear approach to story-telling, which works sufficiently. It also challenges the characters well so that they can develop by the end. One weakness is that the character’s initial interactions seem somewhat forced. They meet up to exchange phones, but then the plot puts them back together for another reason. That second reason (no spoilers) could have been explored more, which is also included in the characters section of this review. Overall, the story is simplistic and predictable, but it is moderately meaningful and genuinely enjoyable.Characters: 7/10Generally, the characters are interesting and bring meaning to the story. Personality wise, Cherry and Smiles are wonderful, and they are written to grow individually and by supporting one another. Their friendship (no spoilers) is wholesome and feels natural once it starts to develop; however, there are flaws with these two characters. First, the story would have benefited from more initial information about Cherry and Smiles. The viewer knows from the start that Cherry has some form of a communication disorder, and we know that Smiles is insecure about her teeth. However, we don’t know why she goes from loving her teeth to this sudden insecurity. Additionally, Smiles seems rather unrealistic when she is introduced. She’s supposed to be a popular social media streamer named Smiles, despite covering her smile. Although this irony is probably intentional, it does cause some misconceptions at the start. The second issue with Cherry and Smiles is their clear initial social differential. It is uncertain why Smiles, who is clearly popular and socially has many potential mates, returns to Cherry at the mall. The story would have grown immensely if it had touched on this topic, especially because we know Cherry struggles with communication. Even something simple, like having a short conversation with her sisters about characteristics she likes about Cherry, curiosity, or even wanting to learn about his disorder, would have gone a long way. As I mentioned, these two work great together once their common goals are established and they interact more regularly, and they have the potential to complement one another in essential ways, which is the premise of the story. The side characters add to the plot, although they are rather basic and not spectacular. However, what makes the characters above-average is how they are wholesome. The story really focuses on the good in people, which can be quite uplifting. Sure, the story doesn’t blast the viewer with the injustices of society and the bullying that is a common occurrence for people like Cherry, but it sheds some light onto how wholesome people can still exist. That’s a beautiful theme that’s developed through the characters.Art: 8/10The art is probably divisive for some anime fans, but the unique textures and vivid colors really bring the characters to life. It also shines in expressing the importance of art in the movie: haiku is used to communicate in the same way that the vibrant and distinctive art conveys its own message. The character designs, walking animations, and even the scenery, are all captivating and unique. They bring out the positive vibes of the story. Nonetheless, the scenes with more action are a bit jerky on the eyes. Specifically, there’s a skateboarding scene that doesn’t seem too fitting for the art style.Sound: 8/10The soundtrack is perfectly fitting. It has a chill but bright vibe that helps to develop the setting. Kensuke Ushio’s work is wonderful, as usual. I will say that this soundtrack may be different from what the viewer might expect, but that’s a good thing. The English dub is excellent.Enjoyment: 8/10I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Sure, it wasn't as deep as I would have liked, but it was certainly a pleasant story.Total score: 7.6/10 (great)"
Overlord Movie 3: Sei Oukoku-hen,"It was genuinely just okay.Visually, it's very good. It also does the Overlord political maneuvering and manipulation as well as the rest of the series. But it felt like it was too crammed into one long run to adequately cover the whole arc.Major fights upon which the plot hinges are over in an instant when they should have lasted longer (It was supposed to be staged to make it look like a difficult match up for Ainz) and worse yet they happen far off in the distance so you don't even get to enjoy the action and animation together like a regular fight. It's just...a couple of colored streaks through the sky and some flashing lights for a minute or so and then a winner is declared.But that's not even the biggest complaint. Half the new characters felt so under-cooked that it made it hard for me to care what was going on. The paladin lady - Remedios - was probably the worst. She was incredibly irritating, and had the potential for a whole mental breakdown arc over the events of the story that could have played out well.... if this were a full season of anime. Unfortunately, a lot of the supporting backstory needed for this is completely omitted. She has no reason for her position, her obsession, nor her drive and it all feels lackluster. Any really compelling moments she could have had throughout the story were either cut entirely or stunted by terrible decisions in directing.Nea Baraha was a decently compelling character, but came off more like a fangirl with how fast she develops her respect for Ainz. Given more time, she too could have been a much better character. It wasn't like I hated her, but she suffered the same effect as Remedios because of the cramming - her writing felt robbed of potency.And all that while the story crams what feels like a lengthy campaign into about 2 hours and 20 minutes, cutting corners in every way it can to reach a conclusion within that time frame, and awkwardly interrupting the story with the whole advertisement for rune technology in a way that wasn't funny or even super important to the plot.Wait until you can watch it from home, get some alcohol, and enjoy. You'll have a better time than I did driving 40 minutes to the nearest showing at 9:30 on a Sunday night."
Cong Hong Yue Kaishi,"I REALLY WANT THIS ANIME TO BE A GAME !!!The animations is amazingly done, it feels like you're watching Resident Evil kinda, with more high technology. Like small horror, but with sci-fi. The effects while in battle, even the smallest movement on their face expression is nice done.The story is unique as well with plot-twists. You follow a guy and his family. The guy get hired by some high profile military to defeat the enemies and monsters. Which makes it a very interesting story.I love the intro song, it sounds like a Christmas song to be honest, but if you read the...lyric it's actually a little dark lyrics to the song.Really like the ending, but also hoping for a season two or a game release of this."
Dandadan,"With its deep storytelling and hilarious antics, this anime shines. It stands out as one of the best in anime history and really focuses upon the coming of age of high school students. It is a story of laughs, of intrigue, and of pain. The visuals are stellar with an amazing opening song. It is art incarnate as it is deep in many aspects while still showcasing it's humor and angst on the surface. A must-watch for any and all anime fans. I should know, I have seen so many over the years, having watched thousands of hours and hundreds of anime. So far it...is on par with Freiren, Steins;Gate, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, and other god-tier anime. I only hope they can end it in just as spectacular fashion. There is no part of it, thus far, that has not been enjoyable."
NieR:Automata Ver1.1a Part 2,"I'll be honest right off the bat an admit I didn't pay the greatest of attention while watching this anime so yea that might have impacted my opinion somewhat but anyways.  The first season just felt a bit underwhelming to me, I feel like going from a 40+ hour game to a short series like this kind of throws of a bit of the balance and attachment we're to feel for some of the characters. Season 2 mostly felt the same way, the animation is up to standard which is good, the main story and even some of the side content is adapted and...its executed pretty well, but again I feel it just goes by to fast. Maybe I'm just watching this too close to having played the game, which was a couple years ago but idk that's just how it felt watching it. Might give this another watch in a couple years with both parts fully released but for now it was just alright to me."
Mushishi Zoku Shou 2nd Season,"This will be a review for both halves of the second season as well as just overall for the OVA's and movies. While I can't say this was 100% as good as the first it still a great anime. It carries the same themes and episodic structure the first season did and just continues to be an enjoyable, sometimes depressing, break from the usual content of most anime. Mushishi is really distinct in that manner, there are a lot of anime that employ the episodic structure but none seem to take it as far as Mushishi with having no overarching plot at all which I...found really interesting. Yes it did lead to having not as much information about the main character Ginko as I would have liked, and I still think would have been possible while keeping the episodic stricture intact, I think it was a really nice break and made it a joy to sit down and watch. I feel like part of the difference in this season was the stories of the episodes itself mostly, there were still some really good ones but there were more this season that I just felt were alright. Also there were barely any actual visible Mushi in this season, more so Mushi that exist as their own thing inside something or as a force of nature, which is a cool concept, but I think should have been mixed in more with other types of Mushi. Overall thought this was still and amazing anime and for sure is one of the greats and I'm sad for it to be over."
Dandadan,Dandadan is a story of duality. I was riveted by its animation but disgusted at its perversion. I was awed by its style but bored with its writing. I hated the opening but loved the ending. I don’t understand how a show could be so fantastic in its presentation but so despicable in its execution/content. If it wasn’t the incessant and annoying shrieks from our high school-aged female lead that pierced my ears then it was them putting bleach in my eyes as they depicted rapey aliens trying to “inseminate” her. Keep in mind that I have only seen a few episodes but I have...absolutely zero motivation to continue. Why must we as a species continue making poor art with the finite time we have? Give me the money that was probably poured into this and I’ll write something better in 5 minutes.
Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi,"I find myself at a loss for words when it comes to explaining why Spirited Away captured my heart so completely. There’s no grand analysis or intricate dissection... it’s simpler than that. For two hours, I was immersed in a world that felt distant, yet familiar, wrapped in wonder and mystery. Then, before I knew it, the film had ended. And though I can’t quite grasp what made it so special, all I know is that I was completely captivated. It was a dreamlike journey that left me with a quiet, childlike sense of awe that I haven't felt in years, lingering even after the...screen went dark. It’s not about the plot or the details, but the feeling it leaves you with."
Make Heroine ga Oosugiru!,"I finished watching this one. It’s very well-produced and flows nicely, but it’s full of predictable clichés. The protagonist isn’t bad, but he’s rather dull, mainly serving as a contrast of sanity against the female characters, who are a bit quirky. The anime feels a bit cowardly in its execution: while the premise is to show flawed heroines, they keep stumbling without developing at a good pace. Still, the intention to address the theme of rejection is worthwhile.The comedy works well in the first quarter, but then it loses its charm and becomes more monotonous. The truth is, love isn’t that simple; it’s not just...about confessing, going through a little drama, and then everything is fine. It’s much more complex. The anime feels cowardly for not showing a stronger, more realistic take on rejection. Even so, it’s enjoyable overall, and it’s easy to see why it became popular."
Midara na Ao-chan wa Benkyou ga Dekinai,"""Ao-chan Can't Study!"" is very similar to ""Ane Log: Big Sister Moyako's Never-ending Monologue""In that its about a girl who misinterprets everything the male protagonist does as being sexually motivated.Ao Horie's father is an erotica writer, and a pervert. Ao-chan's name was even inspired by a perverted expression.Ao-chan wants to distance herself from her father's life style as much as possible. So she overcompensates to the point where she avoids boys entirely.However this is going to be a bit more difficult now since her classmate Takumi Kijima has confessed to her.Now every time Kijima tries to talk or interact with her she has these...monologues in her head and imagines all the sexually perverted things she's afraid of him doing to her.I really love this setup. Like Moyako from Ane Log I find Ao-chan to be a very entertaining character. I just love the way these characters create these crazy scenarios in their heads. Its very funny and very adorable."
Uzumaki,"This is probably the most disappointed I've been by an anime in a while. If not for the hype prior to release as ""the first good Junji Ito adaptation"" I may not have been as let down, but here we are. Can't go anywhere without talking about the animation, even after the first trailers I was already skeptical about the use of CGI, yes its possible for it to look good, and episode one I would say is once of the better uses of CGI in anime I have seen, it still wasn't right. For going as far to be black and white to be...closer to the manga, the CGI and smooth movements were too off-putting, but not bad, good even, but not perfect. Then we get to the rest of the episodes, I'm not even going to waste my breath on this, it was horrible, insane downgrade in quality and a very big let down. The issues don't end there though, the pacing was also changed from the original manga, while not all bad, a lot of it threw off the tension that the original had building as it progressed further and further down the spiral. Some content had even been completely cut or shortened to where it just lost all of its impact. There are no redeeming qualities in this anime other than I would say it soundtrack, and at that point, put the soundtrack on in the background and read the manga."
Boku no Hero Academia 7th Season,"Coming off of the greatness we had in season 6, this is partly lackluster but still good. The pacing felt a bit off, partly due to being split between so many different locations and groups of people but when it really zeroed in a a certain moment was when it really shined. And there were lots of really great moments in this season with many different characters, giving them all time to shine and have their moments it really does feel like its drawing close to the culmination, I was almost surprised we're still getting another full season. I am very excited to see how...it all ends and can't wait for the next season, until then!"
Maou 2099,"PLOTA decent way to make cyberpunk meet fantasy, but obviously not perfect. The shock that the main character had having to downgrade his lifestyle was good, but they rid of it almost instantly. The antagonists are so blatantly made as caricatures of an Evil CEO and His Foreigner SecretaryTM.There's only 5 episodes out as of the day I'm writing this review, however I fear the plot will still be easy to predict.CHARACTERSThe main characters are the conventionally pretty humans, and stated before, the antagonists are just caricatures (also humanoids), and the background characters as just whatever so far. Both sides very ""edgy"" and honestly just...a little cringe sometimes.Despite the relationship between the main character and other immortals is king-vassals, that is not the case between Veltol and Machina. If you are a fan of ""we're basically just married"" dynamics then ding-ding-ding -- they're just that.ART AND ANIMATIONTypical modern ""good-looking"" anime artstyle with some colorful accents that adds some dynamics, makes the whole thing more visually appealing, and adds some uniqueness to the anime.The opening (visually) isn't too good, especially compared to other action or fantasy animes, but at least it doesn't give out any major spoilers (afaik)MUSICNow, this is the part that prompted the thought of leaving a review. If you are a fan of ""cyberpunk music"" THIS IS IT. As a fan of cyberpunk genre (games, books, movies, etc.) I find this anime's OST very nice.Recommended if you're a fan of cyberpunk. And if not - you should still give it a try.""""This is my first review, please forgive any mistakes"" + I'm high"""
"Tensei shitara Dainana Ouji Datta node, Kimama ni Majutsu wo Kiwamemasu","It's a very good title. The main word to describe a lot of things in this title is juicy.Juicy visuals. Drawing is beautiful, lots of animation, there are very cool fly-throughs, a varied colour palette. The action sequences are beautiful. It's fun to watch.Juicy fan service for all tastes. Mylpha, sorry, Sylpha, the maid, the princess with fluffy animals, the shy girl with almost no clothes, and loli on top of that, Tao and her shorts... Mc-kun's special highlight is how to live without juicy shota... The abundance of steam is annoying at times.The plot is also juicy. A lot happens in 12 episodes. There...isn't much connection between the events, but there is a narrative thread. The twists are interesting. There are often hints on them. The level of Deus ex machina in this title is low.This title is easy to watch. The episodes fly by. The characters are memorable.I am very much looking forward to the sequel.Side note. There are these... salons where you can... take a bath and wash yourself, just like mc-kun and his maids, juicy body against body. You don't have to be a shota. Just saying..."
Aggressive Retsuko (ONA) 5th Season,"Well, I'm back after the disaster of season 4. I'm happy to say, it doesn't reach as low as that, but it's still strayed too far from the grandeur of season 1.As mentioned in my previous reviews, I like this show as a grounded take on adult life and issues. Despite the convoluted way it's achieved, this season has a real strong take on unemployment, homelessness, and the meaning of life/working. I felt myself really thinking about these issues in a serious sense while watching.The end is really out of the blue though, and brings the vibe way down. Character act in strange ways, and...plot points(like attempted murder), are just rushed/brushed off without much thought. Despite the episodes being longer, and the last episode being a full 30mins things felt rushed.I'm not sure if they ever plan for a season 6. This didn't feel satisfying as a full finale for the series. The first part relating to unemployment was compelling enough I probably still recommend a watch if that sounds interesting."
Look Back,"Great drama bottlenecked by screentime. It's really a shame it's only 1 hour long, the story is on point but 1 hour is merely enough to connect with the characters. It also leaves no room for any notable character development.It's honestly puzzling why they would try to fit this story into 1 hour, the story is long enough to fit into even 2 hours of screentime. Instead there were several montages but that doesn't really help to bond with the characters.There's no other issue with the movie though, that's why it sucks so much that it's only 1 hour long. Everything else is just perfect,...the music, the artstyle, the animation, the story itself."
Gakkou no Kaidan,"At first, I wasn't going to review this. Almost everything has been touched on in other reviews, but I thought I might share my experience as it seems to be a little different than most.I remember when this first came out so many years ago. There was no dub yet, just bootleg fan subs. And frankly, it sucked. Poorly done, even for a kiddie show.  I thought it was probably much too scary for little kids. The art is sloppy and the animation is mostly less than average. The characters and episodes were poorly written. There's no overarching plot, just Scooby-Doo Ghost of...the Week shit.  The Japanese VA work seemed blah. There was nothing to keep me watching, and I dropped it after 2 or 3 episodes. I could see why it tanked in Japan. I wouldn't have graded the original better than 40/100 for an E- on the edge of an F.Then, over the years, I kept hearing about how funny this was. ""Where TF are they getting their sinsemilla from?"" I wondered. It was many years before I got the picture. People were talking about the official English dub. It took a few more years, but I finally got around to checking it out.The art and animation still sucked. The episodic nature was still lame. But the new take on the characters and dialog was simply off the chain. This version is as brutal and vulgar as Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt. Maybe even moreso. It certainly helped that ADV got the best dub talent avaialble at the time. And the VAs completely crush the delivery. Monica Rial and Chris Patton are especially noteworth MCs. I was LMAO through the vast majority of episodes.But after a while, it all started to wear on me. It became downright offensive. There was nothing or no one in American culture or society that didn't get skewered in the most obnoxious way. Poor Christian Slater! The first 12 episodes were A- material all day long. But I think I can only go as far as giving the dub an 80/100 for a B- as a complete project.Don't let that spook you, though. The dub is definitely worth at least a try. But the sub is Dead On Arrival. For the final overall grade, I'll split the difference and call this 60/100 for a D-. I'd avoid it if you are at all woke or sensitive, but if you like bawdy, and to roll around in the gutter with your humor, you want to check this out."
Dandadan,"I CRIED! I watched the premiere for the first 3 episodes and I knew it was probably one of the best anime this season but I got lazy in writing a review.After watching the latest episode, I just had to write a review to let everyone know. Just watch this anime, drop all the other anime if you don't have time. I am watching most of the anime this season, and this really stands out after the latest episode. If the development of the characters are this good 7 episodes in, this anime will no doubt be the best if not one of the...best anime this season.The characters are truly deep each with their little quirk, the main characters love for each other slowly blossoms as each episode grow and it doesn't feel forced. The side characters are also intense and has such immersive developments to evoke really authentic emotions from me. Think less and do more! I implore you to not spoil yourself on reading many reviews, and just plunge right in and watch this anime. You will not regret it! DAN DAN DAN has my seal of approval, truly deserving of a goated review.Thanks my ayayas for reading!no gpt, trash English, even though I learn from the best. 9/10, I would give it 10/10 if the ending is impeccable. Will come back to edit once the anime finishes."
Dandadan,"Breaking the shounen norm!After episode 7 i can with confidence say that this is a one of a kind adaptation.I have already read all of the manga, but when a studio like science saru can show such passion and love to a work, adding almost double the content that was in the manga (and I'm not talking filler). You can clearly tell that it will be masterpiece of it's own.Dandadan might start off as this one crazy journey exploring the unknown of both aliens and ghost, but it is so much more than that. At first glance it just looks like any other type of...shounen with amazing fights and action scenes. But juggling close to every single mainstream genere in one show. As the likes of romance, action, sci-fi, comedy and mixing all these generes in such a perfect way and even brining us heart wrenching amidst the action romcom that dandadan is. Dandadan feels like this fresh breath of air that the type needed.Usually I can never score a first season of a long-running anime a 10/10 but after seeing the passion and love the science saru put into it and even exceeding the manga it is without a doubt a masterpiece of animation and story telling that the studio gave us. The future is looking very bright if science saru holds on to dandadan!For the love of god, give dandadan atlest 7 episodes, to get a feel of what the series is, and if you are not hooked instantly on the story after that, then it's just not for you!"
5-toubun no Hanayome,"Haven’t watched anything in so long that I immediately jumped into a show I said I'd never watch. I thought this would be a standard seasonal show that isn’t interesting and has fake drama, but I was only half-right.Let’s get this straight. This season is lacking in character development, pretty much all this did was situate the next season. There is a frequent amount of times I pointed out the sloppy direction, and there is also just some straight bad animation. The drama itself, while I wouldn’t call it fake, mainly falls flat from iffy writing. Then the ending was unbelievably goofy and ridiculous....Yet the show just gets better and better as it goes on, from a writing standpoint and production standpoint.Each character has a personality and background. They sound unique, even if they are characterized anime standards. Frankly, I was a little shocked to care about the characters. Getting into the specifics of the character writing won’t do any good however. This was largely a setup season and I feel prepared for the next, but I wasn’t expected to literally laugh out loud at some parts. The show is unexpectedly funny and is thoroughly crafted to be funny. In fact, most of the time this show shines is when it is actively pushing its romances into comedic territory.Long story short, this is a pretty funny show and I definitely wouldn’t put it down yet. I would recommend this to anyone who is willing to give it a try. It’s not as bad as you might think, well at least as far as we’ve gotten to this season. Give it a try and see how it goes."

Keima is actually a very charming young man when he sets his mind to it. And just isn't interested in real-world girls by choice. He is just as skillful in real life as he is in game.I like...how Keima is written. Im glad they didn't make him some dumb cliche desperate loser otaku with no charm. He is a person who is actually smart, and competent for the job even though he agreed to it by accident. A good case of you-shouldn't-judge-a-book-by-his-hobbies.Elsie the demon girl is there to help him out (posing as his sister). She refers to him as ""Divine One"" or ""Divine Brother"" its great 😂She's a bit of a goofball but not useless.Its a good enough dynamic between the two. It works well.Each conquest is basically a parody of an anime slice of life romance. You have a conquest involving a girl who wants to succeed at a sports competition. One involving a blond loli tsundere (my favorite). One involving a pop idol. Etc etc.The moral of each is basically to have confidence and be yourself."
Ryuu to Sobakasu no Hime,"One of my best friends who invited me to see this movie left me in the cinema because he couldn't take it anymore. He was the one who insisted on watching it, I was the one who had just come back from a backpacking journey in Germany, having an important appointment right after the movie regarding my new apartment. Randomly sitting next to me was my other best friend who was on a date with her, at the time, girlfriend. It was their first date and they told me they were contemplating on leaving the cinema as well, but out of morbid curiosity they decided...to stay. She told me it was a bit awkward watching such a mediocre trainwreck of a movie on her first date because you don't want to appear too negative in that kind of situation. I was honestly baffled that the guy who just remade his best movie (Summer Wars), who criticized Hayao Miyazaki for his female characters, somehow got a 14 minute long standing ovation for this movie. I'm convinced that those people were not applauding the genius of the movie, but the fact that it was finally over, and they were simply standing because they were on their way out of the cinema. Good grief."
Renkin San-kyuu Magical? Pokaan,"A nostalgic ecchi anime that I just can't not love. It was one of my first animes to the ecchi side of anime, and I'm really glad It was this one. It's a very fun series, with 4 main girl protagonists: Liru, the werewolf; Uma, the witch; Pachira, a vampire; and Aiko, the android. The anime go through their daily life as they dont know how the human world works. They also seek love and a partner in their lives, what causes a lot of fun situations. If you're a fan of old, but kinda of wholesome, comedy ecchi anime, this one Is for you!I...fell in love with this anime and wish it were more popular! It has a vibe that most anime don't have nowadays—one that just makes you feel relieved and happy when you watch it. The girls are very expressive and you can't help but like them. It's a anime that, to me, It's gold."
Nige Jouzu no Wakagimi,"I wouldn’t call *The Elusive Samurai* the greatest anime ever—not even close to the top—but I still recommend watching it, and here’s why.First and foremost: the art. The visuals are truly exceptional, and worthy of a showcase in the Louvre (well, maybe not the Louvre, probably more in one of the biggest contemporary galleries). Every emotion is captured through the imagery alone, with no words needed. Just by observing the colors, settings, and characters’ expressions, you can feel fear, loneliness, despair, happiness, loyalty, and total madness. And when I say madness, I’m not referring to the craziness of the bandits but rather the thrill our...young lord experiences from being chased.The plot presents some challenges. There are moments when it feels weak, yet this is countered by a series of intense, almost surreal scenes. It can feel a bit unrealistic, especially as we watch young characters outsmarting fully developed adults during wartime. As someone currently living through the struggles of war, this element didn’t resonate as much for me. However, at the same time, we can see the parallels, we can sense hidden problems (as in humans abandoning nature and beliefs) and we can follow the story, still being glued to the screens.The characters also feel somewhat flat to me, though this could be because there’s more to come in future seasons. This anime is not designed to wrap up in one season, so I’d advise some patience. However, I must highlight Yorishige Suwa and Tadayoshi Ashikaga (even if he only appears briefly). These two are so complex and layered that they invite you to examine them deeply. While the younger characters are fun and cute, Yorishige and Tadayoshi feel almost too real, adding gravitas to the story.In summary, *The Elusive Samurai* is a great choice for a one- or two-night watch. If you appreciate art, it’s especially worth it for the visual inspiration alone."
Overlord Movie 3: Sei Oukoku-hen,"Watched it in theater! It is literally a compilation scenes from an anime season, except it dosn't have an anime season. It is like watching the whole anime season in 1 sitting inside a theater, except it is not. Because the editing is like a compilation movie and they cut lot of scenes too.Who would enjoy this editing in theater, no matter how good the content is?! Forget about, overlord's predictable plot like every other season, SO BAD! Two of my casual friends (who do watch overlord, but watch less anime overall), literally slept and said it was so boring and I agree.It...should have been an 8-12 episode season, instead."
Kenpuu Denki Berserk,"I need to start this review with not one but two disclaimers- 1. As I write any time I review very old anime, the only fair and proper way to review anything is in its own time and me reviewing it now, nearly 28 years later, is imperfect 2. I am well aware of how unbelievably influential this manga series, anime and IP as a whole would go on to become and that the entire Souls series, the iconic Buster Sword from FF7 and many, many other acclaimed pieces of fiction are heavily inspired by Berserk. Nevertheless, I'm here to discuss only this anime and...judge it on its own merits, NOT the entirety of everything that falls under the umbrella of the Berserk IP. I have not read the manga and how good it is, and I understand that it is exceptional, is irrelevant for purposes of this review. With those key points out of the way, let's get into it!As with anything from this time period (1997), some parts of Berserk have aged better than others. The overall, bigger picture narrative is still superb and more than holds up to this day. Some of the moment to moment writing, however, particularly in the English dub, would not meet modern standards. Throwaway villains in particular have serious cases of ""bad guy voice"" and have terrible lines straight out of Yu-Gi-Oh The Abridged Series along the lines of ""Hahaha... Now I'm going to crush you... WITH MY AX!!!!!!!!"" in the deepest, slowest, most stereotypical villain voice imaginable. Additionally, characters lips moving are frequently imperfectly aligned with what is actually being said, which is something companies are a lot more on top of today.Graphically, while this doesn't look like garbage, it obviously shows its age and couldn't come close to passing for a modern anime. It wasn't painful to watch just a month out from 2025, but even for its own time I don't know that its presentation was ever where it distinguished itself. It looks similar as far as graphics quality is concerned to many of its contemporaries. Thematically, Berserk was willing to go a lot darker than many anime of its time, and darker than many anime today, and what we saw in this anime was after significant REDUCTIONS to dark and violent scenes were made, with the approval of the creator. It certainly stood out in this regard as it was simply willing to go where many another anime will not.Guts is a mixed bag of a main character. He is extremely powerful and badass, likeable and he's absolutely layered and evolves as the series progresses. On the other hand, he also absolutely falls into a number of tropes and stereotypes and he has Wolverine-esque recovery from countless, often extremely serious wounds suffered on the battlefield and Bryan Mills levels of general imperviousness to anything and everything his opposition does. To their credit, they at least show his scars and physical wounds and have a number of episodes where he is wrapped up in bandages or actively in the process of recovering, but nevertheless, the level to which this man is unaffected by crippling or lethal levels of damage, and the speed with which he bounces back as if these things never happened, are not realistic even within this universe and they are conveniently applicable to Guts alone because he is the main character and the plot needs it to be that way. He is stabbed very badly and very deeply in the shoulder and is bleeding like a faucet from the wound, but less than one minute later he's calmly making love to the person who stabbed him. That's an oversimplification of course, and I understand what scenes like this were going for, but they were among the more egregious examples of the ""invincible main character"" trope that this anime blatantly falls into.The lack of a proper, ongoing villain plagues the entirety of the series. Generally speaking our protagonists are simply fighting against opposing military forces or something akin to ""The Empire"", but there's never one true big baddie, even on a temporary basis, that drives the plot forward. Once you get to the very, very end of the anime, and if you know what happens after that point, you can understand WHY this decision was made, but if you were to watch only this anime and not dig further for outside information the criticism that there simply isn't a proper, longstanding villain at any point during this entire 25 episode runtime is very valid. The plot at its core is about Guts and Griffith, their interpersonal and complex relationship and their relationship to other members of The Band of the Falcon (or Band of the Hawk if you watched the English dub, which is an obnoxious inconsistency) more so than a good versus evil or hero versus villain kind of setup. The other members of The Band of the Falcon/Hawk are a mixed bag. They generally fall into tropes and archetypes and don't ever meaningfully develop beyond the secondary, largely one-dimensional role the plot wants them to play, but they at least have adequate lines and screen time and are consistently present, even if clearly and ubiquitously less important than the main protagonists, in all the major plot events. There's only a handful of these characters though, as for an army supposedly comprised of hundreds or thousands of men at any given time, we really only ever get to know perhaps half a dozen of them. I would have liked to have seen more development of these core secondary members and I would have liked tertiary members and beyond to be less comprised of nameless throwaways. Ultimately it often feels like The Band of the Falcon/Hawk are a group of four or five people who matter and then a bunch of disposable, nameless throwaway nobodies who follow them. Also, other than one specific character, Corkus, who is set up as an unlikeable, antagonistic towards Guts jerk from the very beginning, there's a distinct lack of conflict and betrayal within the group, which is very unrealistic given its size, makeup and high turnover rate. Speaking of which, how exactly does this army keep replenishing the soldiers it loses in any given battle and how do we know the new recruits are skilled in battle or any amount of loyal to Griffith when it really comes down to it? Unsurprisingly, this is never addressed.Pacing wise Berserk is largely in line with anime of its time period in that it's slower, more drawn out and more focused on telling a bigger picture story than it is on moment to moment entertainment. There's frequent combat and blood throughout the entire show, though a lot of that combat feels very samey, to break up slower sections. There were a handful of smaller stretches where I started to get a little bored, but it was never egregious in this regard, and there certainly doesn't seem to be any filler or any episodes without clear purpose. In 25 episodes of anime they adapted over 12 full volumes of the manga, which is a lot of meat on the bone, but that brings me to perhaps the biggest elephant in the room of all...So the ending... IF you know where it's going/what comes after and IF you opt to do outside looking into beyond what the anime shows you, this is a fine and logical stopping point as it is a major, major plot event that sets up the entire rest of the series. If you DIDN'T look up more information, however, I can absolutely see how this ending would seem completely out of nowhere and nonsensical and be highly unsatisfying. If you were to go into this truly blind with absolutely no idea of what's to come, this would be one of the biggest WTF endings of all time. It happens very, very quickly and there's no way to anticipate it. CLEARLY this wasn't intended to be the end but rather a stopping point that they were going to continue in a future season, but we all know how that turned out, and therefore, if we're judging the anime solely on its own merits and assuming that any given viewer does not have prior knowledge of the series, this ending is very questionable. With all that said, they say the best endings are the most memorable ones, and this is CERTAINLY that...At the end of the day I largely liked Berserk and I can certainly fully understand, with the benefit of hindsight, why this went on to become so ridiculously popular and influential. I come from a unique perspective in that I've never read the manga and I watched the anime for the first time one month before 2025, which is way, way after the fact. In its own time, this show was something special. Today, it has aged only decently, and has clear room for modernization. The setting, scope, bigger picture narrative and willingness to go dark and heavy are absolutely awesome. The moment to moment writing, voice acting (especially for villains), lip-synching and out of nowhere, unexplained, unresolved ending are all a bit more questionable. I tried to be as objective and neutral as possible with this review if we are looking at the anime and the anime alone and taking all other factors out of it. Where does that leave us? If you like dark fantasy, hit the damn like button for this review and go watch Berserk. :)1997 RATING- 9+2024 RATING- 7-8PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 7.5-8"
Dandadan,"Dandadan is one of the ""best-selling products"" of the Fall 2024 season, why am I calling it a product, you may ask? Well, it's because I can't recognize it as a story. While the show has many downsides, it does the things that matter nowadays incredibly good for the anime community to adore this. Things such as interesting characters, basic logic, events that don't just spawn there, and many other things are unnecessary.The story doesn't make any sense, as it's just random villains wanting to kill the 2 main characters because they are just bad guys and that's their job. That's it. The characters that...take part in the action are the following: 2 female characters made for fan service (degen bait), and 1 regular guy that through a miracle nobody could have foreseen, now has superpowers. Another thing that modern shows struggle with is permanent deaths, the question that is now in everyone's mind when the characters are in trouble is not ""Wow, is he dead?"", but ""Hm, how will he escape this?"", thus removing all the tension. Another thing that makes the story absurd is that the protagonists, who are supposed to be human are thrown into concrete walls at supersonic speeds, yet they beat the one-dimensional bad guy unscratched in the following 5 minutes. One purely subjective thing present in this show is the comedy, the corny degenerate jokes that will make every dweeb die of laughter, personally, I don't find anything funny in this show.Now, let's talk about what the show does incredibly well, as specified in the introduction. The animation, and the fighting choreography, to no one's surprise, are the thing that makes this show from a nonsensical product to everyone's favorite. I know this review may seem emotionally driven and pretty short, but I can't find anything to praise, or even talk about or philosophy on the subject in cause.Have a good day! Any critique that would lead me to write better reviews is much appreciated."
Eromanga-sensei,"Every once in a while you will click on a show with a stupid synopsis thinking it will take an interesting turn. This is not one of those times. I cannot find the redeeming quality of Eromanga. That usually puts a show at 2-4 for me. The rating of 1 is saved for shows that offer nothing but also attempt to disgust you on top of that.It's one thing to make a harem about middle schoolers. It's a completely different thing to regularly sexualize them with questionable scenarios or questionable camera angles. If you ignore that, you will have to also deal with the incest...baiting. If you ignore that, I am not sure what will even be left.The cast is the average cliche cast. A very quick and accurate description: Dense, reactive, safe, status quo maintaining protagonist. Shy sister. A tsundere and a sheltered girl.This results in some of the worst conversation I have seen in my life. The protagonist just maintains the status quo in every conversation. ""Im sorry"" this ""Excuse me"" that and nothing progresses. It is the worst when he's talking to the sister. When he talks with his sister it is ""strong force meets immovable object"". His sister, being the one-trait shy cliche acts embarassed and the brother just spews pleasantries and small talk that means nothing and goes nowhere. This takes up a very significant portion of the show.It is very awkward to watch siblings flirt. The show tries really hard to incest bait with the sister in general. It tries to tease this romance between them with the sister blushing and what not. It makes the filler dialogue between the siblings even worse because now it's interrupted by ""awkward accidental sibling flirting"""
Ousama Ranking,"Minor spoilers ahead.Ousama Ranking wants to be unique among the other shows in this era, and to some extent, it is, but only among Japanese ones. The setting is very similar to a classic European fairy tale, and even the story somehow manages to go in that direction. Still, it fails the litmus test very badly, in the sense that after the first couple of episodes, which are very similar to what I used to watch when I was a kid in Disney movies, the author of the series manages to reward the villain, the same villain that wanted to ruin the lives of millions...of inocents, because she was a misunderstood woman all along.The setting/world-building is not at all impressive, just like I said earlier, it's a classic fairy tale world (Some random towns each and there, some evil hole and that's pretty much it), it's clear that the show doesn't want to impress the audience by the world in which the action happens. (I'm talking solely on the anime)I found the story very underwhelming, it's nothing new, and the only things that want to make the show ""unique"" are the very bad decisions of the characters. For example, one character loses his body, because a woman in the mirror tells him to drink a potion, telling him he will become stronger if he does, hence starting all this mayhem. Fake deaths are very common and the villains are turned into misunderstood guys with a last-second flash-back. Talking about villains, the characters are mostly bland, they fit in the archetypes they were created with and never tried to escape or be unique in any way.One of the positives of this show is the art direction that it took, if you don't care about the previously mentioned points you will get the dopamine rush sought by so many. Notice I've decided to put ""Mixed Feelings"" just because in this day and age, I feel like a good animation will get you further than a good written story.This is one of my very first reviews, if you have any tips for me/any books that might help my phrasing, please let me know. Have a good day!"
Rekishi ni Nokoru Akujo ni Naru zo,"It's a fun watch. You'll enjoy it if you just go along with whatever it throws at you without thinking too much about the plot holes. It's a lighthearted anime that doesn't try to do anything more.Alicia (the 'villainess') is pretty likeable. I appreciated that they didn't make her a prodigy (well, kind of, but compared to Liz, the 'heroine' of the game she got sucked into, she did have to work her ass off to get to where she was). Her interactions with other characters are entertaining and shows a great deal of personality and individuality which I enjoyed. The talks about philosophy,...politics and morality are...barebones, as you would expect, but does its job of characterisation well enough and doesn't get long and draggy.Liz, as is typical of this type of anime, comes with her own gaggle of mindless supporters. However, they were relatively silent during their appearances, which is a great writing choice. I came to have fun, after all, not to get a headache from watching annoying caricatures.What I enjoyed about Liz is that she's a real force of nature, like actually terrifying in how much power she wields and how incredibly delusional she is. I always feel like she could seriously get someone killed and still think she did the right thing. It's way more compelling to watch than the weak simpering female characters that this type of stories often write the 'heroine' as.Bad things: the romance really gets on my nerves. Duke had a crush on Alicia when she was so tiny that she just reaches his waist. Like...Alicia's brother was (rightfully) treating her as a baby while Duke's here giving her heart eyes. It's...weird and almost made me root for Liz and Duke just because they're...actual peers. I believe Duke would've been a young adult when Alicia was barely a preteen. This age gap has them kissing, pinning each others against walls, and ending up in bed together (albeit innocently). It's not comfortable to watch. Thankfully, I think this is more a writing fuckup than a problematic relationship moment, much like how the anime had the in-game Alicia apparently becoming classmates with kids way older than her despite telling us that the game version of her was pretty damn incompetent. So I made generous use of the fast forward button and had a great time overall."
Ore dake Level Up na Ken,"A Manhwa Adaptation that Exceeded My ExpectationsStarting with high hopes after reading the original manhwa, I had set my expectations for this anime adaptation extremely high, even while remaining cautious. The original conveyed such dynamic energy and motion in its battle scenes that I hadn’t encountered in other series.The world-building itself is unique, almost like a reverse Isekai: instead of a character being transported to another world, other worlds connect to ours through ""Gates."" These portals allow monsters to invade Earth unless they’re defeated in time within the gate by Hunters.Hunters are humans who have undergone an awakening, granting them extraordinary powers, with their strength...ranked accordingly. As often happens in these stories, our protagonist starts as the weakest human, facing a journey to become ever stronger to overcome each challenge.However, it’s not the premise that sets this story apart, despite its unique twist compared to similar series. It’s the protagonist's development that truly shines. His journey from a childlike, unprepared state in a world teeming with monsters and morally ambiguous humans to becoming an adult who understands not only the world around him but also his own strengths is powerful. He’s driven by an ambition to grow stronger to protect what he loves against any threat.While the supporting characters have limited screen time, they are precisely introduced, leaving plenty of room for development in future seasons. If these seasons follow the source material as faithfully as this first one has, they’re bound to succeed.Throughout, there’s a constant tension as the characters balance on the brink of life and death, fueling curiosity and pulling you toward the next episode to find out what happens next.In my view, the hardest part of adapting the manhwa was capturing the fluidity of its animations. By blending various animation styles with careful attention to detail, this adaptation didn’t fully match the source's kinetic energy, but it came impressively close, making it an enjoyable experience in its own right.In conclusion, I believe this anime faithfully adapts the original work, setting up numerous possibilities for future installments. It leaves viewers wanting more of Jin-Woo’s journey and personal growth."
Akebi-chan no Sailor-fuku,"This anime could have been a 10/10 if it had some sort of depth or drama.  The animation is freaking beautiful, the colors, the characters all of it.  The music is top notch, and flows so well with the animation.  The characters appearances were amazing, and the main character Akebi has so much personality.The show has no depth. All the ladies are all so nice to each other,  there’s no romance, there’s no deep sad story behind any of the characters. If this show had some sort of mean girls, drama, romance,  like some sort of life hardship,...etc something to give it more depth I would be freaking 10/10ing this show on my list. However I found myself dreading the finish the last few episode after the hype of the beautiful animation and music wore off."
Narutaru: Mukuro Naru Hoshi Tama Taru Ko,"I usually don’t write reviews, but this anime was such an unpleasant experience that I felt compelled to log into MAL and warn potential viewers. If you’re expecting a coherent plot or interesting ideas, steer clear.This is supposed to be a monster-tamer series, but it barely explains anything. Instead, it floods you with characters and their dragon companions who appear briefly and are then forgotten. The story jumps all over the place—from military psychic wars with monsters to a revenge arc about a bullied girl. There’s also a lot of edgy content, especially in the final episodes, but it doesn’t add any substance. The sudden...bursts of violence and suffering feel random and might catch viewers off guard, especially those who are already struggling to make sense of the confusing narrative. Every episode left me so lost that I’d often have to rewatch parts of the previous one, only to realize nothing important had happened.I’d only recommend this for someone who enjoys early 2000s-style edginess and has already seen classics like Elfen Lied. However, keep in mind this adaptation isn’t particularly gory, as much of the graphic content from the manga was censored."
Yeosin Gangnim,"With such low reviews I wasn’t expecting much from the show, but I was blown away by the amazing colors and looks of the characters, and the intro song that is original to the show? I actually downloaded the song to my playlist for the car it’s that good.   The show is deeper than most rom coms and goes over topics like suicide, severe bullying, etc. I reallyDon’t understand the bad reviews?  There were a few spots where the animation looked alittle funny in moments, but that was just the animation style. Most 12 or 13 core shows have a few episodes...that are super slow and boring but honestly all the episodes were intriguing and interesting.  Great show overall!"
Eiga Daisuki Pompo-san,"Boasting brilliant practicalities and procedural of the industry, Pompo The Cinephile is an exercise of technical mastery that overwhelmed its own weight, suspension, and story.It is impressive how beaming with passion this movie is to the craft. It's an anomaly that an anime movie is even allowed to be this practically effective. Shirobako and Bakuman came to mind when thinking about the show in the same vein, but even they are still confined to its medium and hard to break the meta. Pompo on the other hand, will explicitly morph its own narrative if that means they can show you in the most literal sense...possible, what an editing room feels like. You'll be ushered into the process of the industry from the perspective of an efficient director on a very well-organized production, so all seems neat and effective. Everything is so effective in fact, that you'll forget things supposed to be artistic..I assume, just like me, many others got introduced to this movie by reels online showing the struggle of the female protagonist, Natalie. Then we learned the premise is about the cinema industry, and all of a sudden, this movie feels exactly catered to us cinema enthusiasts. Almost like an obligation. Hell, they even put ""Cinephile"" in the title, so it can't be more obvious than that, right?! But watching it will make you realize, it is nothing more than an obligation.For a movie about artistic vision of a director, the director feels like the most faded figure in the background. This movie will beat you in the head with every lavish transition, subtle exposition, artistic montage, and formulaic catharsis, but vision is the last of their concerns. We got jebaited by the dramatic prospect of a struggling actress trying to get into the industry (it's not their fault, honestly), but in reality, the movie is nowhere that intimate. They like to think it was personal, but the profound struggle of the protagonist is so basic to the craft; it's 101 instructions on how to be. It's superficial!Not exactly style over substance; more like, the style is the substance, which makes it worse in my opinion. If you want to witness something with a vision, that also function as, the substance is the style, watch Eizouken!!"
Isekai Yururi Kikou: Kosodateshinagara Boukensha Shimasu,"If you enjoy cute, wholesome slice of life anime then this anime may be for you. This anime is nothing extraordinary, but it is simple and focuses entirely on the slice of life aspect of raising children. If you are looking for slice of life to turn your brain off and just enjoy then this show is it.There is not much to say about this anime as it is akin to a basic kid’s cartoon. The art style and color scheme are what you would expect of a basic isekai/fantasy anime. There is nothing particularly special about this anime, but I still found myself thoroughly...enjoying it while watching. The voice acting in the subbed version is good with my only complaint being the voice acting for Alan when speaking individually. Throughout the show the kids, Alan and Elena, generally speak in unison but sometimes they split sentences or speak individually. When speaking individually Alan’s voice sounded older than the depicted age (5). The cute factor from this show comes almost entirely from the kids, the animal companions do not contribute as much as one would expect. Most likely due to the simple art style which limits the details of them. The story aspect of the anime splits between the progression of the kids and the background to why Takumi, the main character, is in that world and what his purpose is. The actual story barely progresses and answers only one main point about who the children are. Something the show does an exceptional job with is depicting many aspects and events of raising children. Although most aspects and events are simplified and or exaggerated, they are very realistic to what you would expect from reality.My lower rating of six for this show is simply for the fact that it is not a show for everyone. If you are a fan of slice of life and cute-factor anime, then this show should not disappoint but if you are not or you are looking for a strong story or action focused anime this is not it. This show is a great slice of life show to watch if you just want to wind down and turn your brain off."
Banana Fish,"If you like josei and want to read this then idk, sure it's interesting to see the perspective of a male abuse victim and it's cute how in love Ash and Eiji are...BUT THAT IS IT! other than Ash's past and a few cute Eiji and Ash moments this anime has nothing. Everyone has plot armour, none of the stakes feel real, the world setting doesn't feel real at all despite being based in NY, there are no interesting dynamics between the gang members or the villains, they either hate ash or follow him blindly...Bad characters, bad writing, bad plot.Worth watching on 2x speed...for Ash and Eiji only if you are a diehard fujoshi but you will get crumbs."
Tsue to Tsurugi no Wistoria,"At first glance, I honestly thought the show was adapting off a really old light novel series. Just the cover art of the anime exuded 80-90s style. Something like Orphen, Slayers, etc. And I thought that such an old light novel had potential to finally shine since it's finally getting a modern adaptation.Yeah, can you believe that it's a manga adaptation that was made in 2020? Come on. We're living in the modern era. A show with such a predictably cringe, oversaturated with tropes, and a white bread MC whose only trait is that he's ""kind and protects his friends"" really doesn't cut it. It's...even set in a medieval fantasy school world where there are such predictable young arrogant masters trying to get in the main character's way. Plus, sprinkle in a few female side characters that are infatuated with him one way or another, you got a pretty much a formula from the 80-90s.For such a synopsis and set of characters to actually appear in a traditional shounen manga is not what I expected. It's not even a gag or trying to make fun of the generic fantasy setting. It's literally just a very cliche and old fashioned, brining absolutely nothing to the table other than make yet another boring shounen show."
Overlord,"Overlord is the Game of Thrones of anime. There are only few shows at its level or beyond it. Every action makes sense and affects the plot. The level of foreshadowing is unmatched. A plot point introduced in the first Season becomes relevant in the fourth Season. Most importantly, there is conflict and consequences for everyone. Each action Ainz takes has a consequence on him and the World. For example, the fight against the Undead has an impact on Ainz, causes the appearance of a hidden character and the departure of another character. Also, Ainz has real conflict. His conflict is not fighting someone stronger...than him which is a boring conflict for a protagonist. He has the best conflict, inner conflict. Ainz has to find ways to conquer this World while maintaining stability between the different kingdoms under him. This is Real conflict which does not depend on training or getting stronger through a powerup like a lame shonen protagonist. This is also a conflict which will never get resolved because the different races under him have different characteristics and preoccupations. Also, Ainz has another conflict. He is constantly at War with himself if he should be cruel or merciful.Sometimes, he does not know what methods to use.The carrot and the stick. Ainz, having two internal conflicts make him one of the best protagonist of all Times not only in anime but in cinematography and the best isekai protagonist of all times.What is great about Overlord is like I said actions have consequences. So, It is unpredictable. You know Nazarick is going to win but you dont know how they are going to win and what events will unfolfd during their conquest, you dont know what individuals they will encounter. There is plot twist on top of another plot twist.Every character in Overlord is unique and tied to a theme and each has a character arc.This Season, Ainz,Enri, Clementine, nphirea, Brain, Albedo and Shalltear grew as characters and the best thing about Overlord is it is not the end of their character arcs. They will keep growing in future SeasonsAll these reasons make Overlord a masterpiece"
Blue Archive the Animation,"Blue Archive the Animation is more of an anime project for fans of the game than a stand alone adaption. This is mostly due to a lack of world building and sometimes poor story. You should give it a try if you play the game or have had any prior exposure to Blue Archive.There is very little world building so anime only watchers will be left with lots of questions. Core concepts (like why they have halos, why are they immune to bullets, and where are all the humans) are completely ignored. Plot points, characters, and other content from the game is mentioned, but never...expanded upon. For fans of the game it's fun to see content adapted, but anime only fans will be left with a hollow experience.The plot is decent, but the story was poor in some parts. Several times enemies were introduced as being ""unbeatable"" just to be stomped with little resistance by the end of the episode. Mercenaries and soldiers suddenly had terrible aim or completely stopped shooting when main characters would rush into the open or needed to carry out a conversation mid-fight. At one point a character whispers to another character, leaving the audience questioning what they just spoke about, just for it to be explained 2 seconds later. I would imagine that in game sometimes you do run into enemies that take several attempts to beat, and when characters do have conversations in battles it is not blatantly obvious that they are in the open. IMO they did not adapt it well, but those are also just common story tropes so whatever.Overall, it feel like an anime where cool OCs (original characters) were created first and shoehorned into a world and plot when it was time for storyboards. Personally I only enjoyed things that I had prior exposure too (Unwelcome School and thunder thighs Yuuka), and sat stone faced or impatient for everything else."
Nageki no Bourei wa Intai shitai,"This is a ""The Eminence in Shadow"" alike. There, the guy is stupid op, and the show goes in a series of idiotic but extremely entertaining ways to keep you hooked.Here, it is the same ideia, but he is stupidly weak, being a party member of the strongest elite and yada yada, but the idiotic but entertaining shit happening is still there, weaker (in my opinion), but considering this trope is pretty scarce, i'm willing to praise it maybe more than it deserve.Don't go in if you expect a serious plot, drama, tension or something of the kind. It's a fun stupid with some ok...moments, that because are amist idioticy shines greater than it would in a separate instance/serious place. And just to be clear, being idiot isn't necessarily bad, if it understands it's setup and plays in it. And it (kinda) does."
Tsuritama,"It was perfect, i give it a 7 because Haru and yuki didn't kissOutside jokes this feels so original and unique, i wish this was more longer because the feelings this give i can't explain, its a piece of art.Maybe it doesn't have the best story but the important thing of a series it's how good they can transmitted their message and in this case was perfect every character feels so warm and close to the viewer, i really feel bad that this doesn't have a manga or more chapters.pd. Haru sometimes feels like a really stupid guy but that's his charm"
Chi. Chikyuu no Undou ni Tsuite,"It is a great and intelligent story. It has been a long time since I read the manga and I was very impressed. It is very philosophical and makes you think deeply. It is a masterpiece that will remain in the history of Japanese manga.Some people criticize the original work without reading it all the way through, saying that it is not historically accurate, but that is a completely misguided criticism. It is also not a story of religious criticism.I have read the original work to the end, but those who criticize it must not have read the original work.They still don't understand the author's...intention. And the author, UOTO, drew this story knowing that it is not a historical fact."
Kiniro Mosaic: Thank You!!,"This is more than just a good ending for a slice of life anime with cute little girls. It holds a deep emotional attachment for me because it was the anime that fully introduced me to the world of anime. I’ll miss this incredible group and all the moments I spent watching it.My only complaint is that the film’s pace is very fast, accelerated to fit the ""necessary"" in just an hour and fifteen minutes. Many chapters were adapted, and some even skipped, which made the development feel rushed. The secondary characters end up being underutilized, almost like decoration, without playing a significant role in...the story. For those who want a complete experience, I recommend reading the manga, where everything is told at the proper pace, and all characters get their deserved attention.Even so, the story is still very good and delightful to watch, keeping you hooked from start to finish. For sure, I’ll give this magnificent work called *Kiniro Mosaic* an ""AYAYA~"" — I mean, an 8.See you next time! *I cried writing this reference.*"
Look Back,"A movie I was waiting for with feverish anticipation. I read the manga before it got an official us release. I preordered the physical manga the day it was possible to do so. I bought my ticket to see it in theaters the second they were available. This movie moved me to my core. Despite already having read the manga and crying then I still cried multiple times watching this film. The scenes were not only brought to life they were elevated. The music, the colors, all were woven together to make this film the masterpiece of emotion, friendship, creativity, love, and passion it is....The story of these two girls is moving and powerful. Everyone should watch this movie but creators should especially watch this movie."
Uzumaki,"Honestly probably the best anime I have ever seen, it feels as if the manga has come to life, quite literally through the animation style, the fact people have given anything other than masterpiece is a travesty, if you know the manga of Junji Ito you will love this, if not I suppose that is why people aren't appreciating it.Regardless, as a fan of both horror and the amazing Junji Ito I absolutely adored this and how well it was done, his work is always disturbing in a captivating way which makes you fell enticed to the world he has created, this anime is...no different.I watched it yesterday and I will be watching again in the weekend to share the experience with my friend, thank you to everyone who took part in making this masterpiece."
Undead Unluck,"I suppose i should start this by simply saying, yes it gets drastically worse in the middle of it but it picks up later do not abandon it! I myself was on the verge of abandoning it on episode 16. I feel like many have fallen around this episode and thus the rating tanked a bit.I think some plans changed and around 4-5 real episodes are missing and the air is filled with repeats and stuff like that, similar to what happens in One Peace. I guess they wanted to leave us on a cliff hanger and thus the qualify of anime dropped because...they had so much material and too many episodes to fill.Is the show still good? Yes.The story itself is very hmm... well... it is very difficult to describe without spoiling it. It is filled with emotions :) It is not by any means perfect, it does lack sometimes, but in the end as a whole it is a great show and i recommend it to you dear reader. It feels fresh, its funny and dumb, the graphics are very good, voice acting is top notch. The only thing lacking is the pacing and a bit of void in the story, but if u ignore it or if some fans make a cutout version without the air fillers it is a very good story, a very good show.What i mean by fresh is in the endless sea of bad isekai and romance this anime shines best. Comparing it to some of the greatest animes? Nah... but as a thing you will enjoy your time with? Yes. It has some new ideas, it has some boundaries and rules.So have fun and be strong because the bad part will eventually come and you have to overcome it!"
"Shangri-La Frontier: Kusoge Hunter, Kamige ni Idoman to su","A good anime full of action. Simple in terms of plot and character development.The world of this anime is normal. The game conventions are there, as well as the meta information for the players. The author smoothes out the game universe. You're not watching Let's Play after all.The visuals are good, cheerful, bright. The backgrounds are nice, the locations are different, the visual design of the characters is varied. Not that it's fresh, but it's done well.The characters and their personalities... There's no depth, nor should there be. That's not what the genre is about. It's an arcade. Everything is simplified, made vivid, details are...smoothed and minimised. The author is consistent in his portrayal of the characters. That's pleasant.The plot is simple and straightforward. No intrigue, no investigation, no drama. Elementary simplicity.The closest analogue to this anime is soda. It's a sweet, fizzy liquid with a distinct taste. Becomes distasteful when it's get hotter and fizzled out. Better not to drink too much of it at once. You'll get sick.It's great for resting your brain while watching some action. This title is not without its nice moments. I especially remember Yakuza boss Rabbit forging the dagger."
Vinland Saga Season 2,"“I have no enemies.” The second season of Vinland Saga is the culmination of a foundation laid prior and is one of few stories that captures the essence of people as opposed to written characters. Having the confidence to tell a narrative, despite knowing some would be unwilling to see it through or try to understand, garners massive respect for the author. Strive to appreciate the messages of forgiveness, acceptance, and redemption. We are encouraged to become better people in spite of the burdens we carry or when enduring circumstances beyond our control. Please watch this with your full attention. This one is truly special."
"Komi-san wa, Comyushou desu.","*No spoilers*This review is for the anime adaptation of Komi-san wa, Comyushou desu, also known as Komi Can’t Communicate.SummaryKomi Can’t Communicate is about a girl named Komi who struggles to communicate due to her social anxiety, and a boy named Tadano who befriends her and supports her on an expedition to make 100 friends. The story covers themes of friendship, communication, and disabilities, though it does so by antithetical means. Unfortunately, the storytelling makes the plot and characters unrelatable, and the side characters detract from the themes. To avoid spoilers, I will simply state here that Komi does not overcome her anxiety the healthy way....Instead, she has classmates that are ludicrous. The side characters don’t push her the right way; instead, they stalk her, creep on her, sexualize her, and even abduct someone. The general concept was interesting at first, but the full story is not something I recommend. If you want a goofy, silly, and “fun” story, then give this one a try, but don’t expect it to tackle anything deep. For a much more meaningful story, I recommend A Silent Voice, and for an anime that actually tackles communication disorders and insecurities, I recommend Words Bubble Up Like Soda Pop. Even Dorohedoro addresses themes of friendship and communication better than this show.Story: 4/10Komi Can’t Communicate is about a girl named Komi who struggles to communicate due to her social anxiety. She meets a boy named Tadano who initially befriends her and attempts to support her on an expedition to make 100 friends. The story covers themes of friendship, communication, and disabilities, though it does so in an adversative way. Unfortunately, the story is largely unrelatable, and the side characters detract from the themes. Episodes are just single skits that are loosely related and barely help Komi and Tadano work towards their goals in a meaningful way. Komi does not overcome her anxiety realistically, and she is a poor representation of someone with social anxiety after the first few episodes. Instead, classmates hand her a friendship, as an offer, in bizarre and grotesque ways. These classmates are unhinged characters who stalk her, creep on her, and even abduct someone. The initial episode emphasizes, with realism, Komi’s struggles with social anxiety in a high school setting. It is unclear why the rest of the story completely puts this aside for awkward and counterintuitive plots, weird sexualizing scenes at the water park, or bizarre abductions, but this is what happens after the first episode. Consequently, the show is impossible to take seriously. It feels like each episode is a goofy skit that tries to take on a serious topic: mental health and, specifically, social anxiety. Instead, it comes across as creepy and off-putting. Even the scenes that are supposed to be funny are irritating and unsettling. As a therapist, I was hoping it might be a helpful show for my teenage clients to watch and learn from; instead, it just makes a mockery of mental health, the school setting, and the viewer’s intelligence.Characters: 4/10Komi started as an interesting character, and her communication struggles are elucidated in the first episode. She also finds a friend and clear crush in Tadano. Aside from this, the characters are extremely ridiculous. Think of old PC games where you could randomize the appearance and stats on your character. Imagine an entire set of cast members like this. That’s what happens here. They are creepy, harmful, peculiar, and antithetical to the themes of the story. Why are they all in love with her? If this story were serious, Komi would struggle to communicate because of her anxiety and would be outcasted. That’s the reality of social anxiety and communication disorders. She would have to work hard to overcome her social anxiety, learn to put herself out there, learn to open up and be vulnerable, take risks, communicate assertively, set boundaries, etc. Instead, other characters worship her, creep on her, and are completely unrealistic. This is unappealing and completely ridiculous. The characters are negating of the initially asserted premise of the show. Komi and Todano are decent, but not profound. Everyone else is terrible. Overall, the characters are a huge weakness for this type of story.Art: 6/10The art is fitting for the characters and story. It’s nothing special, but it is sufficient.Sound: 5/10As with the art, the music is sufficient.Enjoyment: 3/10This was not for me. That’s not a guarantee that it won’t be for you. I would not recommend this if you’re someone looking for a serious show that tackles mental health and social anxiety. Unfortunately, that’s what the first episode tries to sell you. I was very wrong.Total score: 4.4/10 (low-average)"
Shoushimin Series,"The first two episodes of this show were good. They got me hooked. On top of that, the animation and art style are beautiful and refreshing. The cinematography is gorgeous and something you don't see often in anime, and the sound design and voice acting are outstanding. I had high expectations after those first two episodes and was really invested in what was going to happen next, what was going to be the great mystery that had to be solved. I really wanted to see how these characters were gonna grow.But as the series progressed I found myself not enjoying the episodes anymore. They...were getting repetitive- and everything was getting solved way too easily and quickly. Nothing had repercussions that felt real- that felt like they really would change the story.Maybe I missed the point of this one, but the ending felt flat, rushed, and sour. I feel like not even the characters were happy with that ending, and maybe that was the whole point of it, but still, it didn't feel right. It felt like they didn't grow and even though they reached a resolution, it wasn't far from where they started.What a shame. I really wanted to like this anime as a whole but at least I'm gonna take with me how beautiful it was visually."
Look Back,"An emotional masterpiece.Was having a terrible day - rushed, frustrated, on the verge of tears - I saw this film on the Amazon suggested and decided to put it on, having seen the ads...Cried a whole bunch during the movie, and after the credits finished rolling I felt the strength to go get something to eat for the first time that day. Took a shower afterwards, and ate the rest of my birthday cake in bed. An exceedingly special moment of self-care for me.Thank you all from the bottom of my heart, to everyone involved in the creation of this film."
Natsume Yuujinchou Shichi,"After 6 long years, Natsume Yuujinchou finally returns with a brand new season! And yes, it was worth the wait.To put it very simply, it's just like it's previous 6 seasons, in all the best ways possible. Despite having over 70 episodes, every story told feels fresh and interesting, it seems like this series never runs out of material. The fact this anime is still able to surprise me with it's stories sometimes goes to show that it really is a very beautifully and carefully written series with a lot of love put into it. The atmosphere is always on point, the music is as...beautiful as ever, the episode plots are heartwarming and the characters are consistent and lovable. Studio Shuka has also once again done a great job with the animation. It's definitely improved a lot compared to season 1, with it's softer linework and colors.While this season is only halfway done airing at the time of me writing this, I have no doubt that the upcoming episodes will also deliver the same quality as the show always has. I genuinely want this show to go on for as long as I live, it's just THAT good.Whether you're a longtime fan or someone who's brand new to the franchise, Natsume Yuujinchou Shichi is absolutely worth watching, it's one of the best Iyashikei shows out there!"
Banana Fish,"Amazing, fantastic and tragic. Banana fish was the first anime that really had me full-blown sobbing. Ash Lynx is raised by an infamous gangster, Dino Golzine. When Ash grows up, he has his own gang and must stop Dino from catching hold of the Banana Fish, a mysterious drug that causes insanity. Ash is a victim of rape, sexual assault, child pornography and human trafficking and along the way of him searching for redemption he meets Eiji, an innocent assistant cameraman from Japan, him and Ash become extremely close and Eiji joins ash through his journey to stop Dino. People may argue over this being...a BL or not but if you ask anyone who actually watches BL, we all can agree it is.It's an absolute masterpiece of a story but I am a little bias, I mean I have a banana fish tattoo on me, but it truly is a beautiful story and I think anyone can truly love it if you watch it, even if you are not into BL."
Haikyuu!! Movie: Gomisuteba no Kessen,"I will start by saying that if yoy have not watched all of Haikyuu to season 4, do not watch this. It won't make sense.With that said,  just finished watching this and it was exhilarating!! The long standing rivals finally got to have their match, abd it was perfect. There were a few references to previous seasons that allowed the characters to bounce of eachother with taunts and jokes. It was also great to see their growth.The animation was also on point! I especially liked the cage scene, if you watched it you know what I am talking about. It was just a brilliant...way to illustrate how they were making Shoyo feel. I also though the POV at the end was cool. We were so caught up in the match and how fun it was that we the audience didn't even know it ended yet.Others say it went to quick but it was nkce to watch a full match without having to wait for another episode.Translation: 10/10Animation: 10/10 eventbiugh it was brilliant I feel right at the end Shoyo had less detail to his hair than usual. Maybe that is just me.Audio: 10/10Plot/Story: 10/10Characters: 10/10 Awesome interactions between Kuro and tsuki, and Shoyo and Kenma.Overall: 10/10"
Waluolan Xiao Zhen,"Valoran Town is a parody animation involving Riot Games' League of Legends characters. The audience is intended to already know the characters in the show, so I doubt this will be enjoyable for those who aren't familiar with LoL.For those that are, however, this is a great spoof SoL series primarily focused on Lux, Jinx and their hijinks, along with a bunch of minor characters. While the plot isn't especially relevant, there still is a progressing story in the background that wraps up at the end.The art is pretty decent for how restricted the animation style is, and while the comedy skits often fall flat,...there's enough of them in such frequency that it's made up for. The characterization of the characters is faithful enough to the source material, though the show pushes their tropes to the max which can be a little unbearable with Ez or Jinx sometimes.I'd recommend giving it a shot for any League enjoyers, it's a pretty short series so it's not a great big commitment if you end up disliking it."
Violet Evergarden,"Violet Evergarden is a show that's lingered in my mind long after the credits rolled. It's one of those rare gems that manages to be both visually stunning and emotionally profound.The story follows Violet Evergarden, a former child soldier who's trying to understand the meaning of the words ""I love you."" She becomes an ""Auto Memory Doll,"" a writer who puts people's feelings into words. Each episode is a self-contained story, focusing on a different client and their unique emotions.What makes this show so special is its ability to delve into the depths of human emotion. It tackles themes of love, loss, grief, and the...power of words with a delicate touch. Violet's journey is one of self-discovery, as she learns to empathize with others and find meaning in her own life.The animation is absolutely breathtaking. The soft colors, intricate details, and fluid movements create a visually captivating experience. The music is equally impressive, perfectly complementing the emotional tone of each scene.While the show is slow-paced and introspective, it never feels dull. Each episode is a masterclass in storytelling, leaving you with a sense of satisfaction and a lingering sense of wonder.If you're looking for a show that will make you feel, Violet Evergarden is definitely worth watching. It's a beautiful and poignant exploration of the human condition, one that will stay with you long after the final credits roll."
Nichijou,"This show is a masterclass in animation as a form of comedy in its solitary medium. Over-exaggeration of inward emotions being reflected in the bombastic animation styleization is phenomenal. This show lends itself quite well to the slice-of-life genre and remains one of the key outliers in key animation styles for the genre.Nichijou reflects the basics of passionate life, through various clips on youtube, to rampant online gifs, there is no way to avoid spoilers with this anime; moreover I think not only should you watch this in spite of the spoilers to certain scenes, but watch this because the experience will be even funnier...in my opinion if you're just waiting in suspense for that one mail man scene or just the iconic dog bite.There's so much to say about this show but to tie this review off I implore you:Watch it, watch it, please watch it.Especially now, especially now, especially now.Take a break, laugh with Mio and Mai!8/10"
NieR:Automata Ver1.1a Part 2,"IntroductionGoing in to NieR: Automata Ver1.1a Part 2, I was expecting more of the world and action sequences defining Part 1. What I eventually got was something way deeper and all introspective in a manner that is just overwhelming. It's just about a shocking about-face for an anime to bury spectacle for the cerebral voyage into what existence means, fighting, or finding meaning.The whole angle of view completely flipped from just 'watching' the story to being amongst turmoil inside the head of the characters in the second half. The episodes just seemed carved out for your mind with so many question marks, very often causing...thought processes which had rarely been provoked. This shift of gait, tone, and telling changed everything and came as a refreshingly beautiful surprise beyond every expectation.CharactersIn that vein, it centers around the three central protagonists-2B, 9S, and A2-but part two treads deeper into each of their complex emotions and struggles, very differently so for each. What really struck a chord with me, however, was how their interactions with one another, and even each of their inner turmoils, became an analogy besides character building to explore existential themes.On the surface, 2B is quiet, but that melancholy cloak overflows from an ocean of bottled-up emotions-of one struggle between duty and desire.On the other hand, 9S has attachment, loss, and learning about his existence more on the line emotionally. A2 actually personifies the raw interpretation of what that would look like in search of meaning within an apathetic world. It is not hard with each of these characters to sympathize and question what motivates them and drives the actions taken by them.Plot & ThemeThat gives Part 2 its thematic depth and echoes into answers about philosophical questions which continue long after the episodes are over.The anime isn't just about the war between man and machine; it's deep down in the introspection of free will, the existential dread, and the circle of life. And with each episode unraveling, came a tale of so many questions: ""What is living if the choices are set?"" and ""What is the meaning of suffering?""These are not easy questions, and NieR: Automata Ver1.1a is unwilling to give an easy answer. A story that involves the apparent endless fight in the world catches the essence of human fights, which are somewhat circular in nature since we, just like the androids, are into the repetition as part of trying to make meaning in routines which may well be essentially futile.Pacing & ToneThe pacing in Part 2 is much slower than one would anticipate, with a reflective atmosphere that lends gravity to each character's journey. At first, this choice threw me off, but it quickly made me realize the pacing of each scene and revelation was lasting. This formula, where moments of action are followed by introspective silences, creates a haunting rhythm, further emphasizing the philosophical tone of the anime.This tempo allows for a balance where the audience can appreciate, if not the story, then at least the reflective themes of the anime without being rushed. It is as if the anime wishes to make us tarry, think about it, feel the weight of every character's emotional arc.Visual AnimationThe visuals in *NieR: Automata Ver1.1a* tell a story unto themselves, just as much as the characters do. The art style brings this post-apocalyptic world to the fore, with a tinge of desolation that at the same time is both beautiful and sad. From desolate landscapes to exquisite fight choreography, every frame stands like a work of art, reflecting the chaos within the characters.The desaturated color tone and subtlety in details give the place an air of deliberation-a mood deeply emotional, reflecting the themes of the story too, as a matter of fact. This is much more than just aesthetic appeal; it's about creating an immersive atmosphere where the beautiful coexists with despair.Music & ScoringThe tone of the music this season takes on a whole new range, embedding emotions in the scenes to bear even weightier philosophical depth. Ethereal and haunting is the score, thick with melancholy tones resounding along lines of existential questions battling within the characters. And how many times the music rises during quiet or introspective moments caught my notice-almost, as it were, the voice through which we're taken along in the themes of the story. The tone that it sets for every scene with the music is so perfect; it's almost like it gives the weight of emotion to the music to take the story and invite the viewer into the ups and downs of the characters. It changes it into an experience much similar to the truth it represents-beautiful but haunting.ConclusionPart 2 of *NieR: Automata Ver1.1a* stops at nothing in amalgamating those genuinely rare combinations: considerate storytelling and rich philosophy with depth in feeling. It is not mere adaptation but an art which stuns the viewer into the essence of existence, purpose, and the struggle cycle that everyone has to go through. For me, this anime went much beyond entertainment-it was a deep poignant experience which stirred some of the questions and insights which I never thought of. Such a season: it moves a video game story to such an emotional and intellectual odyssey that fully deserves a 9 out of 10 and shall be remembered long after the credits roll."
Nageki no Bourei wa Intai shitai,"The show is pretty fun. I certainly don't think it's for everyone as some of the characters can come off as obnoxious. But, something I really enjoy is the fact that the main-character isn't taking all the screen-time. There are some episodes where he's mostly not even on screen. So you're watching more of the other characters in the story, with the main character being mentioned by name only.I don't know why, but I actually rather enjoy this kind of story. But, other then that, there's nothing ground-breaking about the show itself.  It's great if you want to kill some time."
Maou 2099,"A PRIME Example of how overdone tropes can still feel engaging if done right!Demon lords and retainers, Fantasy X cyberPunk, out of the gate overpowered protagonist and the pseudo-isekai/timeskips have been beaten to death as themes in recent anime.Maou 2099 does EXACTLY all of the above, yet still feels FRESH.And I think the secret sauce lies in simplicity and not overshooting your shot!Most fantasy/isekai shows sacrifice the sanctity of their setting for the sake of producing short moments of cheap awe and hype or go into a fan service route (*blush* >.<), things the average anime fan is bored with at this point.Moreover the characters...seem so 1D they might as well be this line  that I just drew ——————And this is where Maou 2099’s approach of sticking with simplicity of the plot and showing relatively real characters shines!!!!The setting shows how a master at magic demon lord when resurrected after 500 years is completely left behind in strength and skill, leaving him broke and irrelevant.How is once all powerful retainer is surviving as a normal part time worker in this new era, and how this demon lord who’s source of power is admiration of his subjects plans to rise back to his throne never deviate from the setting established. The idea of “the hero is no longer needed in peace” is also decently done!Pair this maturity of conduct , with polished animation and character design, decent action choreography and a almost cinematic aspect ratio and we got ourselves a show!!!My only criticism is that due to its plan of sticking with simplicity the show doesnt standout much. The cast is limited in variety, the villain is meh at best, the plot/action/writing while good are just that; good and nothing more.A good recommend for anyone who enjoys fantasy/isekai style shows."
Eyeshield 21,"READ THE MANGAThis series is a butchered adaptation of my all time favorite manga. Written by Riichiro Inigaki (who later wrote Dr. Stone) and illustrated by Yusuke Murata (who later illustrated One Punch Man), the manga is an absolute masterclass in sports manga. Beautiful art, deep characters, and badass action, this is a manga you'll love even if you hate American Football.Unfortunately, the anime is not handled well. Studio Gallop (of YuGiOh! fame) is just not equipped to capture the art of Murata or the high pace action of the series. They constantly recycle animation to the point that I have to wonder if they...thought we wouldn't notice. And the art is a pale imitation of Murata's. The whole show just makes me sad to watch and wonder what if a powerhouse studio had gotten their hands on this series?The real issue though, is the story. The anime manages to both cut out extremely important scenes from the manga AND adds tons of unnecessary filler. Like, if you needed something to fill the space, maybe start by adapting all the content from the manga first? They even manage to skip the Ojo v Shinryuji game, which is absolutely inexcusable. And in spite of being 145 episodes long, it still doesn't make it to the end of the series, or even an acceptable stopping point. The last 10 volumes (of a 37 volume run) are chopped off of the end. And while not all of that needed to be adapted, they certainly needed to make it to the end of 34 to wrap up the main plotline of the show and most of the subplots. Instead, we get a cliffhanger into a nonsensical minute long epilogue.Like I said at the top, READ THE MANGA. It's way, WAY better."
COLORs,"Watching this when I first arrived at college was a life changing experience. I kept getting drawn back to it every day, watching it 1 or a few times a day. It just evoked an emotion I had never felt before, an emotion I kept wanting to explore but was unfamiliar with. The animation style and the story are beautiful, and something about it even resonated within me. It was because of this music video that I realized I am transgender, which was the complicated emotion I kept chasing trying to recapture. It took a lot of introspection, but this music video assisted me in...this journey with realizing this."
Flag,"Novel execution for an anime, but baffling premise.Flag is probably most well known for presenting its entire narrative through first person POV shots, mostly through found footage by the two journalist protagonists' cameras or cameras placed conveniently on war machines.  It's certainly an admirable approach and contributes meaningfully to the theme of journalistic importance, but this limitation can find itself in tricky corners.The main narrative point of this story is for main character Shirasu to document a UN special forces team to recover a symbolic flag that she had previously taken a photo of.  While the world-building may have been more appreciated in...other contexts, the overt usage of decked-out killing machines, elaborately militarized religious cults, and clandestine operations to cover up the entire mission by the UN over a single flag becomes straight comedy near the end.  Sorry, a cool photo of a flag does not simply quell a civil war.While the documenting of soldiers as human via photojournalism is an interesting idea, the naivety of Shirasu (despite her being a lauded international journalist in a country engulfed in civil war) coupled with a reluctance to really deep dive into the corruption of Western military institutions, i.e. the UN, slowly devolves into a whitewashing of Middle Eastern neo-colonialism.  Presenting soldiers as honorable people who failed to prevent the genocide in Rwanda and looking to redeem themselves doesn't mesh well with POV shots of them obliterating landscapes with mecha machine guns.The animation isn't bad, but the CG robots are out of place aesthetically and narratively.  Shirazu's voice actress sounds as out of place as the situations Shirazu herself is in 90% of the time (why are you in the middle of a firefight, girl?).  The ending is a confusing neoliberal mess.  But points for trying something new."
So Ra No Wo To,"""The war ended. You're just the last remnant. Humanity...the world can never regain the glory it once had. So end it. It must be far too painful, living a miserable life in a world filled with despair. Is there some meaning to survival in a world like this?""It's easy to write Sound of the Sky off as a military flavored K-On clone, and I certainly see where that assertion might come from, but I am here to tell you how very wrong that is. Sound of the Sky is not just a military themed show about moe and music, but a story of recovery, companionship,...finding purpose in life, the universal healing power of music, and the horrors of war.The thing about Sound of the Sky is that, as a slice of life, it is very slow moving. It takes time to savor its setting and characters while it slowly eases you into the meat of what it's about. It works perfectly for the genre and is highly effective. If you are a fan of slice of life stories, you should have no problem taking it slow and taking time for the story's themes to resonate with you.The story is about a young girl named Kanata who joins the military of her country, Helvetia, because when she was young she saw a solider playing Amazing Grace on the bugle, and it changed her life. She became a solider because she too wanted to learn how to play such a beautiful song of hope and healing, and in this society, no one else will teach her how to play.That's right, she joins the army not as a solider but as an artist. She didn't go into this wanting to fight for her country or bring violence onto other human beings. Remember that. It is an important fact for later.She is stationed in a lovely town called Seize with a platoon of other young woman around her age. Seize is a small, peaceful community that did not face the brunt of the war Helvetia has recently come out of. As you can expect, being stationed in a place like this means that not much happens, leading to the perfect setup for a bunch of cute anime girls to hang out together and do cute things.Except here's the thing: Sound of the Sky does not forget that its characters are soldiers.The show spends its first six episodes slowly introducing you to the characters and world. It ruminates on its setting and war-laden times of its world. Amidst showing off what the characters care about and examining the little things that make life worth living, it gives small glimpses into the horrors of the world these characters are accustomed to. Due to war in the past, most of the world is now uninhabitable. There is no longer life in the sea. Society was so irreparably screwed over that, while the languages are still the same, countries and cultures are entirely different.There is something inherently beautiful about a slice of life set in a post apocalyptic world—about finding meaning in a world already destroyed and making it your home again anyways. The world ended but we're still here. Things might look grim but we will find a reason to keep living, even if its only little things like glass animal figurines or lighting fireworks with your friends.And then episode seven happens, and the show gives all that it has to challenge that idea. Kanata did not join the army as a solider, but the other members of her platoon did. So the show displays the truth of being a solider and the pain and the death, and amidst all of that it begs the question of why? Why keep going on in a world like this?And Sound of the Sky answers that question. If there is no reason to go on, make one yourself, and you'll probably find it in the people who love you.It doesn't stop at episode seven, however. The end of the show leans hard into the military aspect, and it isn't shy about showing what being in the military means. Kanata did not join the military as a solider, but she is one and she will have to be one when duty calls. It sets up a kind, empathetic premise about connecting with someone from an opposing culture and opinion and then tears that to shreds with the truth of being in the military.""As a solider, I have killed people too. So even if no one else forgives you, I will.""But, in the end, things settle. This too shall pass—even war. And when the dust has settled, you look at the damage that has been done, and you rebuild. You mourn what has been lost forever and then you rebuild anyways. It started as a slice of life and it will end as one, even after asking us why we continue to live and laying bare for us the reality of war.And what do the soldiers hear in their direst of times that gives them the motivation they need to keep going and bring an end to the fighting—the motivation to reach a point where things have settled? None other than the Christian hymn that started it all.The world ended, but humans are still here. The world ended, but we still speak the same languages. The world ended, but people still play Amazing Grace around the world.And there's nothing more I can say that these parting words will not:Amazing grace! How sweet the soundThat saved a wretch like me.I once was lost, but now am found,Was blind but now I see."
Munou na Nana,"Despite social acceptance, and government endorsement, the self-reflective and/or self-aware mind will always have trouble coming to terms with their own morality. For those conditioned to dehumanize others, they may only reintegrate into society if at all, through a long and difficult path. A terrifying thing is that humans are so moved by the beauty of character growth, that we seek out evil; at rock bottom, we can only progress upwards.Monou no Nana elicits more explicitly, a question underlying Violet Evergarden. Why can personal loss, subsequent good deeds, changes of heart, character growth, and time, earn moral forgiveness for evil deeds?  The viewer (they)...feel immediately guilty and short-sighted (yet also catharsis) when they realize that they've been tricked into forgiving what the victims' friends/family would certainly (and rightfully) decry as murder.Regardless, legally, there is no question. the characters' who kill have the full endorsement of the government and are in the ""right"".Government sanctioned murder; war and/or assassination: Can you forgive a serial killer? What about a soldier who kills during war?  What if these morally gray acts were rose tinted by the fact that it was a cute anime girl?Why is it that pink haired girls are so evil and hot?"
Aggressive Retsuko (ONA),"I was close to dropping the show when it seemed like just office shenanigans bookended with some death metal venting. It's a lot more than that though.Retsuko has a lot of hardships to work through, and following her through her journey to try and find purpose was a treat. I found myself being happy for her when makes some friends, and enjoyed the death metal parts as well. Lots of memorable characters too, with cute designs. Especially Retsuko.Overall, a good show that goes deeper than you might think. I recommend it. I don't really know what else to write on this review. I don't want...to spoil anything."
Urusei Yatsura (2022) 2nd Season,"This review takes both seasons into consideration.I'm glad I finally gave this classic story a chance. It was really, really entertaining. The pacing of the gags, the direction of the emotional scenes, the art direction, the character designs, the way the writers stitched different chapters around to introduce the supporting characters and give the illusion of development...Chef's kiss. As an Inuyasha fan who's now re-discovering Ranma 1/2 through its excellent remake (so far), this series definitely managed to capture the spirit of Rumiko Takahashi's writing.Funnily enough, I think they dropped the ball on AtaLum just a bit in comparison. Season 1 adapts two very romantic...stories during the first half of the season and then we don't reach the same heights with them until the end of it. I'd rather have those stories pushed towards the end or have more AtaLum stories adapted.On the contrary, the first cour of the second season did a great job at highlighting AtaLum and mostly adapting amazing stories one after the other. The second cour could use less Ten and more AtaLum before the final episodes. It almost felt like a regression, even though the story is mostly episodic in nature. If not more AtaLum, I'd love more stories about Lum and her best friends. The three of them are probably my favorite part of the story.I really have to praise the pacing again because Ataru, for me, is a very annoying character whose womanizing act got tiresome pretty quickly. As I'm going through the 1980's Urusei Yatsura movies, it becomes more and more clear to me that he can't carry a full-fledged story centered on him for the most part. He's too much for me. I get the purpose of his character, but I don't really enjoy it. And still, Rumiko and the remake managed to make me emotional during AtaLum scenes and root for them. That's something.The voice acting deserves a special mention because it's absolutely phenomenal. Lum, Ran, Sakura and Shuutaro are scene-stealers.I definitely recommend this remake. It's a fun and easy ride full of eye-catching moments, well-paced gags and some really touching moments. It's insane how many tropes probably originated from this story.7,5-8/10"
One Piece Fan Letter,"I literally made a MAL account and waited a week to write a review about how amazing this special episode was. I was expecting NOTHING from the episode but now, I'd sell my soul for a spin-off series focusing on normal citizens in the world of One Piece. The episode itself was a roller coaster ride. It's funny one moment, emotional in another. Despite the short screen time of the characters, it was surprisingly easy to grow attached to them by the end of the episode. They were all very well written despite the short runtime. Rewatched it few times the week it was released....Genuinely wished it was an hour long. It's just so genuinely beautiful and I can't describe it any other way.The animation also suits the overall whimsical aspect of One Piece. You can tell that the episode was made with a lot of care and consideration both towards the fans and One Piece itself. Long-time fans would definitely enjoy this episode. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone who only watches One Piece for the sake of it or just for the action."
Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai.,"I thought this season was two steps forward, two steps back.More or less, everything good about Oreimo S1 is still here. Good cast, funny, etcHowever, some characters get more attention than others, which is a shame.I did come to appreciate Ayase in this season, the second episode of this season is one of my favorite in the series, they did her yandere side justice this season.I've kinda poked fun at how Saori's just... the glue that holds the dysfunctional girls together but she actually does get character development here, which was sorely needed and greatly appreciated. However, I felt her appearance at the end was...kind of rushed? Idk, I still felt like she was otaku Saori for the entirety of the season until she went to the homecoming party (more on that in a second) as Saori Makishima and she was flaunting her good looks and rich girl personality like huh?I feel like pacing is my biggest issue with this series, a lot of things only take place over two episodes at most when you could hypothetically get a lot more content out of some of these plot points.I did enjoy the new character in the game development club over in the Oreimo S1 Specials and while Sena does get a good scene with Kirino's male friend, we don't really see her that often, which is weird considering the increased focus Kuroneko got and considering both Kyousuke and Kuroneko are part of the game development club...Speaking of Kuroneko, I finally see the vision of Kyousuke x Kuroneko. I did appreciate how they wrote the two together in their scenes, although for all of the screentime she gets, she's basically in the exact same spot she started in.However, this did confirm that Oreimo is indeed a harem where a sprawling cast of cute girls all fall for a milquetoast MC and while that's a fine series normally, it still befuddles me why Oreimo did this.I will say though, it kind of loses the plot on the otaku stuff? We do see it come up but it's mainly for jokes or for background information when they decide to indulge in flashbacks so we can learn more about the characters.This season, for better or for worse, is more about the personal drama involving the characters. Which I guess makes sense. But this season only really works if you enjoyed the comedy and/or characters of Oreimo and wanted to see more of them and their story, I don't think it's as thematically striking as the original.Unfortunately, this season also kind of has a ""novelist arc"" like S1, the mock exam arc just felt like filler? It formally introduces one of the characters into ""I love you, Kyousuke"" territory but he just immediately turns her down? Maybe in the S2 Specials, it'll do more with the parents but it just felt like wish fulfillment to show that no, it's not just Kirino/Kuroneko/Manami who likes Kyousuke, it's basically every notable female character in the series (Sena excluded).Generally speaking, if you enjoyed Oreimo S1, you'll like this. If you didn't, then you won't like this."
Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan,"SHIKA.......NOTSU. If you're not Japanese, you'll still probably understand these phrases after watching the show (not that notsu is an actual word...)Actually, despite all of the great opening you have, the comically bad but also funny deer CGI, and overall a great premise of Noko being a boke in a gag manga, the actual show is pretty tame. I'd say the show is not the highest production value, but it definitely nails all of the comedic execution. By taking liberties of animation Noko as a blob sometimes, Torako as a chibi when acting as a tsukommi, and a few other shorthands, the comedic value stays...the same while still providing good entertainment value. I have nothing negative to say about how the anime decided to create multiple sound tracks with only the word SHIKA. By changing the tone of the OST, you go from some generic happy/sad/somber OST to something actually quite entertaining as you're listening to ""SHIKA"" being sung in many different tones depending on what the OST is.However, that being said, I just don't find the characters to be up to par. Just the manzai between Noko and Torako is pretty average. However, the rest of the deer club is just abysmal. Despite Anko and Bashame making up half the deer club, you barely get to even see them talk. Most of the time, they're just on screen and not talking, or if they are, they stick to their pet phrases and archetypes without contributing to the comedy, dialogue, or scene. It's very weird since you'd think these major side characters would be on screen more often, but actually the student council members probably have more screen time than them. And even if they don't, frankly speaking, the student council body is a lot more funny than Bashame's one pet trait of eating a lot of rice and Anko being a generic yandere sis-con. There's exactly one scene where Bashame and Anko interact with each other that sort of gives some sort of characterization, but it's way too infrequent and way too late.Like I said though, just even the manzai between Torako and Noko is pretty average. A lot of the longer gags are just very unfunny, like Noko acting as a shrine maiden for 5+ minutes, or Noko acting as a flower arrangement instructor, to say a few examples. Same thing with a lot of the short ones too. Noko sleeping in class and blowing bubbles out of her antlers isn't particularly anything too funny, and honestly, shows like Nichijou, Joshikousei no Mudazukai, and more have way better gags and funny moments despite them being  more grounded in reality. When a bizarre show about a high school deer is less interesting and has less varied scenarios than other shows that are more strictly slice of life, you have a problem. And this can be seen even in the setting. 99% of the show is in the club room and student council room. The lack of interactions in the classroom, interactions out of class, and overall just moving around the area hurts the show a lot. Noko never actually pulls the deer club to some random events or anything.Overall, I feel like all I said was negative, but still, the animation and storyboarding alongside the sound design are good enough, and pacing is good. The anime features some fun gags here and there despite most of them missing the mark. I give it a high score only due to it literally being my favorite genre of all time. If you're not a fan of gag shows, you definitely won't like this one. Many eclipse this show in all departments."
Inferno Cop,"The idea of this show is a lot funnier than the show itself. It's a great response to 'what is the best studio trigger anime' but it isn't that fun to actually sit down and watch. It wears out it's welcome after the first couple episodes and after a while it's humour become largely unfunny at best and at it's worst point a bit uncomfortably racist.It's not without charm though, the humour from the presentation of the show is probably its most enjoyable part, and its parody of the over the top action cop movies is fun at times. As a time capsule of a...certain era of internet animation, and as an early project of one of the best animation studios today it has charm but it's best to just watch one or two episodes, since that's enough to get the idea of what the series is like."
Blue Lock vs. U-20 Japan,"A lot has been said about the animation of this season of Blue Lock, it shows all the signs of a show in production hell with an over reliance on graphics, stills and some very ugly and obvious CGI. These qualities alone are enough to take any wind out of the sails of the adaptation, it's difficult to take any of the stakes seriously when it feels like more like a slideshow than an animation, nothing that happens feels quite real. The visual style of the first season at times felt hit and miss, although this time it just feels a lot more garish and...ugly, which is perfectly represented in the nauseating opening animation.Maybe the most frustrating part is that there is on occasion a well animated shot, or an intricate dribbling sequence is well presented. From behind the scene comments, it seems apparent that a lot of the animation work for the show had been thrown out sometime during production and was never completed.All in all it makes it difficult and frustrating to review the rest of the work. The story doesn't feel engaging, and the progression of the character isn't convincing. The list of characters has only become more and more bloated, and while some of their designs are fun, their personality are still restricted to running gags and one liners. When the show initially broke through it's concept felt novel and unique, as it went on  I think it fell into it's own dull status quo and the pieces just aren't falling into place"
Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui!,"Every now and again, I'm reminded of WataMote, and it's difficult to parse my own memories of being a socially anxious teenager at the time I watched it from my feelings on the show itself. WataMote perfectly captures the combination of  embarrassment, slight trauma and the twinge of endearment a lot of people associate with that period in their lifeIn a sense it's the perfect anti-slice of life series, that loves to play with the tropes of the genre, acknowledging the escapism viewers usually come to this type of show for, and reflecting them in the actions and desires of Tomoko. She's an intensely...fun main character and watching her navigate popular scenarios for slice of life shows with her misplaced sense of superiority, social awkwardness and depravity.For the most part it succeeds quite well at being a cringe comedy, but like many other similar shows that tow that line it occasionally falls into being more off-putting than anything else. There were certainly a few episodes where the main joke fell flat, or felt a bit repetitive making the show at times a bit exhaustive to watch.From what I've heard, the manga went on to develop the character and the cast around her a bit more. While a part of me wishes this was something we could have seen in the anime adaptation itself, or in a future season, WataMote is a pretty fun watch that a lot of it's audience is going to find at least to an extent relatable for better and for worse."
Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon,"Never Watched this as a kid and decided to give it a chance earlier this year and overall I think it's fine but at the same time I don't know why so many people glaze this season so much the first half is extremely slow due to the fact that Usagi as a protagonist is boring and annoying as shit I know that she gets better later on but this season has one of the worst first impressions I've seen from an anime the villains are also uninteresting Queen Beryl doesn't do shit until the final two episodes The Four Kings of Heaven sound cool...but end up being boring as shit, it also doesn't help that the shows pacing (at least to me) doesn't pick up until the other Senshi are introduced."
Nazo no Kanojo X,"Easily one of the most underrated and unique anime ! I loved everything about it.Enjoyed it really well. Urabe is indeed one huge waifu material. I love her with everything. My dude is winning in everything.Unique story and the characters are well written. I won’t complain about the animation because this anime literally aired when I was in 8th grade and now I’m 26 and watching anime 😂I won’t say its realistic because I’m not a big fan of drool but, it is kinda kinkyAs a huge man of culture I appreciate this anime and I’m sure all  will."
"Ore wa Subete wo ""Parry"" suru: Gyaku Kanchigai no Sekai Saikyou wa Boukensha ni Naritai","Many of the summer 2024 anime have been mediocre, and this is no exception. The design of the show being based around parrying is intriguing and the clips seen in many show recommendations for this anime piqued my interest however, while watching and upon completion it was obvious this show was nothing special. Between the repetitive and boring combat, the minor or poorly demonstrated character development, and the average character design style there is much to be desired.Some aspects of this show that stand out that could make or break your decision to watch are the lack of romantic affairs, exclusion of sexual content,...and lack of outcome and depth from human vs. human combat. In this show’s case the romantic and sexual aspects are handled excellently. There are no romantic themes present in the show which is not necessarily good or bad, execution of either is what is important. All the relationships within the show are non-romantic, with most emphasis on mentor-pupil and warrior-warrior bonds. This is a very good thing if you do not like shows that drown you with romantic advances and dialogue, there is none of the common blushing/high pitched loud voicing or overly exaggerated emotion that is commonly used to express romantic situations. In a similar fashion there are no over-the-top sexual themes or sexualization of characters. This can be a big turn-off for many people so if that is the case for you then rest assured that this show has none of that. Not only are there no sexual themes (i.e. lewd reactions or suggestive/explicit scenes) there are also no sexualized characters, for example female characters with extraordinarily large assets and revealing clothing that have no reasonably explained purpose. With a lack of romantic and sexual themes the writing does a great job of allowing such exclusions without leaving the viewer with a sense that those themes would significantly impact the outcome or enjoyment of the show. Regarding human vs. human combat this show lacks tremendously. Despite this not being a serious or intense show, the non-sparring human vs. human combat that exists to explain or bring resolution to the plot conflicts feels empty and unimportant. With all battles resulting in little to no casualties with only minor injuries despite the high stakes demonstrated in the context and the overwhelming sense of the good side being the underdogs, the conflict loses importance. It could be said that the major battle scenes could be taken out with the same outcomes and the overall viewing experience would be relatively unaffected.The main aspect of this show revolves around the parry skill that the protagonist uses. This is unique in the scheme of other anime in this genre and was very intriguing, but the intrigue did not last long. Without giving away too much most of the combat victories seem less impressive due to the pattern of the main protagonist always having some trait unique to him that gives him an advantage over his opponent which lead to a feeling of the character always having the correct tool for the job which got old fast. In addition to this most of the main character’s unique advantages were misinterpreted by other characters, while narratively being explained by the main character’s perspective generally demonstrated by flashbacks or past dialogue.  For example (my own), if the main character was immune to fire, the characters viewing the fight would think he would be part dragon born or something, but the actual reason is he sunbathed in the desert everyday for 10 years and became immune to heat. These misinterpretations and explanations are initially funny and unique but lose their charm as they continue to occur.Regarding characters in the show, none are very interesting, including the main character. Most character designs are generic isekai/fantasy styles, seeing as this is a smaller anime such style is not a big deal. None of the characters have bad styles or designs and most don’t have much of a memorable impact. By the end many of the “important” figurehead characters of the story world seem incompetent and annoying. In addition, the main character’s archetype is boring. It seems that the protagonist was an attempt to make a dense character funny but by the end it was more annoying than anything. The protagonist constantly misunderstands or misinterprets different events, dialogue, and actions of others on the pretext of having lived in isolation and not being knowledgeable of the larger world. While the protagonist is visually, vocally, and chronologically depicted as an adult his personality and mental understandings seem more like that of a child. Furthermore, the only “major” character development is from the main character and the, as I would call her, main side character of which are both mild. The main character’s development is more outward and based around his strength/physicality as his demeanor, actions, personality, and drive never really waver. The main side character’s development is fleeting and felt forced. All her development is linked directly to the actions, words, or interpreted meanings (refer to sunbathing heat immunity above) of the main character. In addition to her changes being linked to the main character they are mostly heard, not seen, changes where she acknowledges she needs to change followed by an internal statement that she will.To wrap things up I cannot recommend or oppose you to watch this show. Although I cannot describe this show as good, I also cannot call it bad. This was just an average run of the mill anime for me, it was neither a waste of my time nor a show that will make my top list. This is one of those anime for when you want to watch some anime, and you’re not strapped for time but do not want to start a long or complex show."
Shoushimin Series,"Normally animes that I score 9 are the ones that I really enjoy and finish it in one day but this is one of them where I take my time watch it in special occasion (calm,soothing weather). I have watched hyouka and I easily loose intrest in slow pacing anime like it but theres something different about the authors story of this and hyouka's and the animation is one of the picks that didn't want me to drop the show. Talking about story it's simple yet addictive in each episode but there's alot of standing motion where both characters face off and spew there thinking?...Basically just explain, But u don't really notice.not many characters and Also I don't really got interest in romance (I only watch it for comedies) but I was really expecting the ending to be good and it disappointed me feels like its gonna haunt me every time I remember this anime."
Gimai Seikatsu,"Review of Gimai Seikatsu – An Emotional MasterpieceI have to say, it’s rare for a slice of life anime to move me as deeply as Gimai Seikatsu did. At first glance, the story of Yuta and Saki, two step siblings learning to live together, might seem like typical fare. However, what truly sets this series apart is its masterful directing and heartfelt portrayal of the characters, and that’s what captivated me from start to finish.One thing I genuinely appreciate is how the direction handles emotions. There’s no exaggerated melodrama here. Instead, you feel every bit of what Yuta and Saki are going through, often...conveyed through subtle, almost imperceptible details. The quiet dinner scenes, which are initially steeped in awkward silence and gradually become more comfortable, pulled me in every time. It’s such a genuine depiction of slowly built trust. There were moments where I found myself thinking, “Wow, this is how real emotional development feels.”What impressed me the most was how frequently the direction let silence speak. It’s like peeking directly into the characters’ minds. A simple shot of Saki staring out the window as rain trickles down the glass can say so much more than any dialogue. This emphasis on quiet, authentic moments gives the series its strength. Every camera angle and every pause feels purposefully chosen to add depth.Both Yuta and Saki carry a lot of emotional baggage, and the series portrays this with such sensitivity. Yuta may appear calm and composed on the surface, but it’s clear he’s still grappling with the remnants of his past family life. His thoughtful silences and the subtle ways he watches Saki show how he’s trying to come to terms with his new reality. Saki, meanwhile, starts off closed-off and distant. Over time, we see small glimpses of vulnerability, a hesitant smile, nervous glances when Yuta is around. These moments were beautifully done and incredibly relatable.Special praise has to go to the sound design as well. Music is used sparingly, often emphasizing the tension or closeness between the characters through quiet moments. Those moments of silence, when you can hear nothing but the wind or the faint clink of utensils, pulled me in. They create a sense of intimacy that’s hard to capture, making it feel like you’re eavesdropping on real, private conversations.To me, Gimai Seikatsu is a shining example of “less is more.” There’s no need for over the top drama or action here; it’s an honest, heartfelt depiction of two people gradually opening up to one another. The directing makes every scene meaningful, and the emotions feel raw and genuine. This was a flawless experience for me, and there’s no score that fits better than a perfect 10/10. If you’re looking for a series that thrives on subtle but powerful moments, don’t miss Gimai Seikatsu."
Kage no Jitsuryokusha ni Naritakute!,"Many people have always wondered, including me, if a work of fiction needs to have such a creative and innovative premise to be considered good. Is a story full of overused tropes really that bad, even if the execution is good? I'm yet to be completely sure, but one thing that I can say is, The Eminence in Shadow is an anime Worth experiencing.""Kage no Jitsuryokusha ni Naritakute!"", more known as The Eminence in Shadow, is an isekai about a boy named Minoru, who gets reincarnates as Cid Kagenou, a seemingly ""background character"" from a noble family. In reality, he's obsessed over gaining power, and...becoming a powerful being that lurks in the shadows, naming himself Shadow.STORY/WRITING: 7/10As mentioned before, creativity when creating a premise and a plot as a whole is widely considered to be pretty important, but not everyone has thought that a reimagination of an overused trope can be good if done well. What makes this story interesting is that they took the ""edgy overpowered protagonist"" trope to another whole level, and they went into the right direction if they didn't want to make everything look extremely generic and uninteresting.Overall, the premise isn't creative at all, but they used it to their advantage, by enhancing the worldbuilding and power system compared to most other isekais, creating a much better experience for the average audience. The most important part of over exaggerating the plot is that, if done poorly, can make the story much worse, but if done well, can make it more engaging, and sometimes, more fun, specially for ""parody"" anime. In this case, we can see a lot of exaggeration, for example, every situation Cid creates in his head, only for his ""roleplaying"", always ends up being true, including the Cult of Diablos. This is something really absurd, but it definitely makes The Eminence in Shadow more enjoyable to watch then almost all other anime with the same monotonous tropes.Another thing I can praise about the series is its setting, which shows that the world is constantly and rapidly evolving, most of the time through the knowledge the servants of Shadow recieved from him, and developed on their own. You can clearly see hamburgers becoming more and more common in a world that looks ike it's just about to reach the Industrial Revoution, for example. I find that incredibe, specially because that's such an uncommon trait for anime to show, and it makes the worldbuiding much more interesting from a viewer's standpoint.AUDIO/SOUNDTRACK/SCORE: 7/10Honestly, while the soundtrack could be better in some moments - with more impactful songs in some scenes or better sound effects - I don't have much to complain about it, because sometimes it definitely can make some parts more exiting (specially in episode 5, for example). The voice actors that worked on this are pretty good on average in the japanese version, and they were fine in the english dub (and yes, I watched both for this review), but I want to highlight the VA's of Cid and Delta from the japanese version, which were simply awesome for their characters.CHARACTERS: 7.5/10This is a pretty strong point of the series. I can only complain about the antagonists here, since they look much unoriginal and bland (as of what has been shown in the anime). The Eminence in Shadow stands out the most over other ""edgy"" isekais out there is that the characters are actually charismatic, specially the main protagonist. They surely make the series much more enjoyable, because most other works don't seem to be able to create a cast interesting enough for anyone to care about it, and this anime does the opposite. While they're definitely not that complex or full of depht, their captivating personalities are what creates better character interactions, evolving into more impactful scenes and better dialogue.ANIMATION: 8/10Pretty solid part of The Eminence in Shadow, there's also nothing to complain related to this either. It's really well done, not inconsistent at all and some fight scenes look amazingly done. One thing, though, that's not personally liked is the amount of fanservice. Of course, there are many anime out there with a much bigger amount of these scenes, and the quantity in this series isn't that big either, but I'd rather not see any kind of fanservice, at all.ENJOYMENT: 7/10While it definitely has plenty of good and memorable scenes, the story wasn't that interesting to me, specially because if follows a lot of tropes, including edgy and cringe moments, even if they're done in a comedic way. I had a lot of fun watching it, it's memorabe, it has got a great direction and quality, and I'd definitely recommend it to someone who likes edgy isekais, because this is probably the best one of this type I've seen."
Tasuuketsu,"This has got to be the worst death game anime, I've seen.Is it the terrible pacing, poor writing (maybe adaptation, I don't know, cause anime watcher only), poor animation, terrible characters.Personally, I always try to watch anime I start to the end, no matter how terrible, I always power through it (why do I hate myself?). There's only a handful of animes I've dropped completely and this definitely made it to No. 1 on that list.I was powering through the whole thing, thinking it was a 12 episodes anime, just for episode 13 to drop, I just knew I couldn't put myself through this any...longer.If I recall correctly i almost cried while watching an episode because of how bad it was.The show is that bad."
Steins;Gate 0,"Steins;Gate 0 is an interesting look at what happened between Okabe giving up on saving Kurisu and receiving the message from his future self, which takes a dark tonal shift. The contrast to the more dorky light-hearted Steins;Gate could have been nice, and certainly does have some good ideas behind it, but is overdone and dreary. The first third or so is really engaging, then it gets more grueling for most of the show.  So much time is spent on Okabe yelling the same shit about why he can't save everyone over and over and over and over and over and over. It's as...if the writers are afraid we will forget that he is depressed. It would be nice if some of that time was spent on giving literally any of the side characters more development. Kagari is especially in dire need of a personality. There are so few moments between her saying ""mommy"" 51 times in a row and being an empty vessel, it is just annoying and sad. Her looking similar to Kurisu could have been utilized interestingly, she could have a deeper reaction to this and the resulting tension could affect the character dynamics in a way which would deepen the plot. Even that little bit would have made her an interesting character.There is plenty to criticize. The good ideas that are there feel messy and disconnected from each other at times. Besides his melodramatic outbursts, we also get to see a ""normal"" version of Okabe, Mayuri has 20% more agency, there is a new character who is jealous of Kurisu's intelligence, and guilty about this jealousy now that Kurisu is dead. A sort of time-travel family reunion happens. Obviously there is also Okabe's pain of being able to see a loved one captured in the form of a virtual character, but knowing it is not her. Eventually actual time travel happens again too. But the show is dragged out forever before that or Okabe's arc happens, and when it does the stakes are ramped up way too high way too fast.I want to be clear that I did enjoy this a lot and there is a reason I am giving this show a nine star rating. There are heartwarming moments, a bit of intrigue that was actually engaging rather than simply existing to yank the pants off of the viewer, and interesting character interactions. It is just sad the most meaningful moments are buried underneath more Daru pervyness, annoying melodrama, and an almost useless character.That being said, I am an edgy motherfucker that likes sad characters and just wants to see my favs on screen again, I had fun, and I think many of you will as well. 9/10"
Look Back,"I absolutely love this movie. I have read Fire Punch, Goodbye Eri and am cought up on Chainsaw Man from Tatsuki Fujimoto but I never read look back so far so I basically went into this unspoiled besides knowing the starting premise. Those 53 minutes were a roller coaster of emotions for me and I got really attached to the characters. I recommend everyone to watch this movie, as it is now even on amazon prime (where I did watch it). I never once wrote a review on MAL despite having watched a fair bit of anime but I felt the need to do so...for this one.The story is very good but I also want to say that the Art style (which really captured Fujimoto's manga drawing style well in my opinion) and the soundtrack were absolutely beautiful.I do not often rate things a 10/10 on MAL but for this movie I think it is deserved."
Tenkuu Shinpan,"The anime has a very different approach. While most survival stories are set in ruined cities, Tenkuu Shinpan is set at the top of the city, where the skyscrapers form a gigantic maze connected by rope bridges, a terrible place for people with acrophobia and gephyrophobia.The story stars Honjou Yuri, a high school girl who was teleported to a parallel city very similar to the one she used to live in; after regaining consciousness, she discovers that she is in a place where she must do everything to survive, including killing other people; Nise Mayuko is another girl who was also teleported to the city,...joining Yuri in the goal of destroying the parallel world and finding her brother Honjou Rika, who was also teleported.The suspense, mystery, and psychological thriller make the story very interesting; discovering the past of those involved and how they ended up there, especially the masked ones, becomes a good reason to keep watching; the different personalities and types of characters, the twists and turns and suspicions cater to different tastes of those who watch it.It doesn't have a considerable quality, but it's still a good anime with an engaging story; it has an implicit YURI theme between Yuri and Mayuko; many are complaining about the fanservice scenes, I think these people are more afraid of panties than heights, it's a shounen anime, it was obvious that there would be fanservice scenes; the fact that there are no explicit nudity scenes is reason enough for MAL not to put an ecchi tag on it.If you're not afraid of heights, bridges, blood and panties; and want to watch a survival anime with a slightly different story, I think Tenkuu Shinpan is recommendable!"
Yowamushi Pedal: Grande Road,"This is simultaneously an improvement on the previous season and isn’t. Picking up right where Season 1 ended might have been a mistake in terms of pacing but it definitely doesn’t let up throughout 24 episodes. I definitely do like that it toned down the unexpected sadisticness of Season 1. But the protagonist is the weakest part of the show, he has zero chill and keeps freaking out in every episode for no reason. Just chill bro. I am looking forward to continue on with the franchise. But I think I definitely need to see some changes if I am to be convinced of any...long term success beyond a typical shōnen first two seasons."
Mou Ippon!,"I consider myself somewhat of a sports anime enjoyer however I don't have a particular interest in the martial art of judo. Yet I found myself binging all of Mou Ippon! in a single day, so that should be a testament in and of itself.Don't get me wrong. The sport, judo, was definitely portrayed well and some matches could definitely be put up there next to some more well respected sports anime battles. But in my opinion where the show really shines the best is not that. It's the characters. And more specifically, the interactions between the characters.I wouldn't say a single girl of our...main cast from Aoba West high school stand out on their own but together, it makes all the difference. I had a very fun time just watching them get to know each other better, coming from different background and levels of age, judo and friendships. And most importantly, it felt organic. The show is believable and that's why I really enjoyed it.You don't need a masterclass in writing or a plot that is deep if the story you are telling feels good to experience. Even the matches felt real and they weren't throwing around deus ex machina for the sake of making stakes higher. The show is mostly comfy and a feel good experience but it's not afraid to get serious too and it manages to handle the tones for both well.The animation also pleasantly surprised me. It was mostly very fluid with great uses of camera angles to add that extra oomph. But while I enjoyed the judo matches after getting used to it more, I still wish they would have expanded more on the actual workings of it. Lots of terms such as points and technique names are dropped constantly but never do we actually get proper explanations for anything.Drama in the series was pretty elementary and some of it felt a little forced but it wasn't bothering me too much overall. And the ending of the show feels almost like only a prologue finishing so I definitely was left wanting more. Hopefully it gets another season some day but as is, it's still a fairly self-contained fun show that just works."
One Piece x Kawaisouni: Kono Boushi wo Omae ni Azukeru,"Holy shit this was hilarious lmaoo!!This is way too good than this MAL page might entail, short, to the point, and hilariously funny. It’s like if official accounts were allowed to shitpost.just watch it, a badly out-of-tune We Are remix with doodles of the characters from several moments of the story being memed on, the jokes are clever enough to have to rewatch several times in a row.The franky meme alone deserves a watch. let alone the Zoro slander, this is something not even the most hateful twitter accounts can come up with when slandering a characters, let alone it being an official collaboration makes...it infinitely funnier.Go ahead, it’s on YouTube on the official One Piece channel. A preview for volume 108."
Katsute Mahou Shoujo to Aku wa Tekitai shiteita.,"A slow falling in love story of a magical girl and an evil lieutenant, just like the title says, and it's done in a really good way.Unfortunetaly, the author, Fujiwara Cocoa, passed away in 2015, at a young age of 31, and such the source material barely had 3 volumes worth of story to go off on, having to add new things to it as even the last ""volume"" was a really short one lacking enough chapters. But this, for me at least, adds a whole new nuance over the anime, as it was made after 9 years, like a tribute to the author. Even...though the episodes were short and left you wanting way more, they were beautiful, both in art, music, vibe and presentation of the jokes/story. You can see and feel the love that was put in this anime, and the potential it had if the source material would have continued.It is a short anime, so just go watch it like it is a movie of around 2 hours. It is a lovely story with a diverse cast of characters you wouldn't really expect in such a story, and the jokes they were making.... really caught me off guard quite a few times. They're adult jokes.The only small problem, and this might/is more of a cultural difference, were the ages of the characters, that stuff put a bit of a bad taste in my mouth... but it is Japan, which just recently in 2023 raised the age of consent from 13 to 16, so yea, I can only see it as a difference in culture ig.Story: 9 -- For what it was, it is a lovely story with really nice presentation. Nothing too deep, but it still is an unfinished story, so a lot of things are left open, albeit they aren't that important as this feel like a slice of life mostly.Art: 10 -- The art is amazing! Really love this kind of art!Music: 9 -- Fits really well with everything!Characters: 10 --  Here the characters are diverse and some really caught me by suprise, maybe because I never really watched magical girls themed animes, but this anime is made for adults imho...Enjoyment: 10 -- Had a grin troughout the whole watching of itOverall: 10Right now it has 7.60 from 25.783 votes Ranked #1556 Popularity #2520 Members 78,695 as of 12/11/2024.This review was a bit exaggerated in marks, but this is because I feel like this is an anime I will most likely rewatch, as it is a short and very sweet one that made me smile and laugh quite a bit. It is not perfect by any means, not a 10, but given its context and how and for what it was made, I feel like it deserves a 10.Highly recommend this anime to anyone that wants to watch something light hearted, that will make you smile troughout all of 2 hours of watching the anime, laugh at jokes that are adult oriented, and all together want to see the last unfinished piece of an author's life and the love that was put in this tribute. Just go watch already, it's a short one! I bet you won't regret it!"
30-sai made Doutei dato Mahoutsukai ni Nareru Rashii,"Recommend watching this when life is hard and you feel too old to experience life. The fluff and un-promblematic misunderstandings are the perfect medicine.It doesn't give anything new to the genre but EVERYONE IS OF AGE?? YEY!Highly recommend watching with the dub while drawing or doing crafts. The dub is peak funny and you don't need much brain power.Animation is sometimes pretty and sometimes peak anime poop/crack material, if you make edits please please please make one of this. I found this anime via one YT edit which really sparked my interest on the dub. Also I feel like the voices match better in the...dub one? Crazy."
Xiehou Ta de Shaonu Shidai,"Mom, I'm Sorry is an emotional roller coaster that beautifully combines fantasy with harsh reality. Cuican(whom I will refer to as Henry) is a young man who, only upon facing the imminent loss of his mother, realizes just how much she means to him. In an act of profound sacrifice, he bargains with a lifespan dealer, surrendering four decades of his own life to restore his mother’s youth and health, transforming her into a vibrant 20-year-old with a second chance at life. From here, Henry dedicates his remaining, limited days to making sure his mother lives life to the fullest—even if he has to hide...the true cost from her.One of the show's standout elements is how it portrays the mother-son relationship. Having been sick most of her life, his mother never had a chance to truly experience her youth or live for herself. Her struggle is made more poignant when we learn that she, too, made sacrifices for her own mother, giving up her hard-earned college savings to help a parent who wasn't particularly kind to her.The series does an excellent job of exploring the theme of appreciation and forgiveness. Henry's journey is as much an apology as it is an attempt to make amends for the time he took his mother for granted. His character development is one of the most compelling aspects of the series: he grows from an indifferent son to a compassionate, selfless young man, deeply aware of the importance of family, friends, and life itself.While the show effectively captures the essence of love and sacrifice, some aspects feel rushed. With so many events packed into each episode, there were times when it felt as though the emotional impact was diluted. Perhaps stretching the story over more episodes or an additional season would have allowed for deeper, more resonant storytelling. That said, my perspective shifted by the final episode—it managed to pull everything together beautifully, leaving a lasting impression and satisfying my expectations.Overall, the story felt like a letter from a son seeking forgiveness and redemption, a beautiful yet bittersweet story about love, family, and the ultimate price one is willing to pay for a loved one’s happiness. It’s a series that will tug at your heartstrings, blending lighthearted humor with profound themes that are likely to leave you in tears."
"Isekai de Cheat Skill wo Te ni Shita Ore wa, Genjitsu Sekai wo mo Musou Suru: Level Up wa Jinsei wo Kaeta","Another isekai with an intriguing setup that quickly sidesteps what should have been the heart of the story—character growth, resilience, and genuine transformation through effort and challenges. Instead, we’re served instant wish-fulfillment, shallow characters, a bland protagonist, and a plot that veers into cringe territory.The message seems to be: if you’re an out-of-shape loner, don’t bother with self-improvement or personal growth. Just stumble into another world, get a grab bag of overpowered skills for no discernible reason, hide in a magically invincible house while sniping monsters for experience, and suddenly transform into a heartthrob. Gain a chiseled physique from zero effort and watch the one-dimensional...female characters line up. The show even manages to sprinkle in some hypocritical commentary on the importance of hard work, despite the protagonist coasting by on handouts.Overall, it devolves into yet another bland display of an overpowered protagonist showing off his abilities and collecting a harem of hollow admirers."
Ensemble Stars!,"I assume if you already like the original source material, you'll enjoy this a lot more than I did and can see it as a fun addition to a story you already enjoy. Unfortunately, I do not have the same attachment to the original story, and wouldn't recommend this to anyone who doesn't already have that connection either.tl;dr It was just really boring.The main issue I had with it was the pacing. The story is relatively fast-paced, but in a way that strips away any buildup or ending catharsis the events could've had. It's honestly easy to forget what happened in previous episodes because...of how quickly the anime goes through each plot point to get to the next(A review I saw here described it as ""And then this happens"" storytelling which I agree with). A lot happens in what I watched, but I feel like I remember none of it at the same time. It feels like there's supposed to be stakes but I also barely feel any of it because of how little buildup there is for events that supposedly matter, causing a disconnect between the atmosphere of the show and my own personal feelings.Most of the characters aren't unlikable, but they also don't have much depth or interesting traits to latch onto, and the ones that do also suffer from the anime rushing through it for the sake of getting to the next plot point. Another thing is that it also feels like a lot of characters show up as fanservice and nothing else. It feels like they show up so fans can have ""Oh my god it's him!!"" moments and see Their Little Blorbo on screen and not much else, but I didn't finish it, so maybe this changes(Though I doubt it with how large the cast is). The end result is that I don't care for any of the characters, and only a few stand out to me.The culmination of these issues causes this anime to have a story that bored me nearly to sleep with characters I don't have any feelings(Especially positive) about."
Aria the Animation,"Aria started airing in 2005, but all those years, how could I have missed this gem of an anime?§ OverviewThe setting is a terraformed Mars whose name is now Aqua. We meet Mizunashi Akari, who is training to be an Undine or ladies who row gondolas in the city of Neo-Venezia (obviously patterned from Venezia or Venice) and function as tour guides. She meets different people in the anime, and there's an underlying lesson with each episode.§ RemarksThis is an iyashikei type of slice of life, meaning we not only see the characters in their day-to-day routine, it's a relaxing watch that helps ""heal...the soul."" This is more in line with Bartender (2006) as well as the first half of Frieren.As such, the first season seems to be plotless. (Of course, you have to watch the episodes in order because once a character is introduced, she may become a recurring character or perhaps part of the main cast.) There's no incentive to binge-watch Aria, so I recommend watching each episode at least 2 or 3 days from each other and perhaps watching some other shows in between: namely, other anime or jdorama/kdrama, etc.This anime is not about plot but about vibes, and the atmospheric scenery and musick provide that. Interestingly, the first season — Aria the Animation — is said to be the weakest. I had low expectations coming in. But it surprised me in that even if the first season is the only stuff about Aria one watches, I think it can stand alone as something worthwhile.The lessons are well dramatised. More often, it's explicit but sometimes it's implicit based on what the characters did. For example, in Episode 2, Akari and Aika had a detour and this implies that it's okay to take detours and enjoy the moment. These lessons, I reckon, largely contribute to the vibes of the show.Aside from Akari, almost all characters start with the letter A. They have a great ensamble of characters, and each one brings something to the table. (I like Alice most.)If there's anything I would like to criticise, it's the use of CG animation, and this is its blemish. Aria the Animation was drawn at an unfortunate time when anime was transitioning from the use of cel animation to digipaint. As such, the computer-generated objects, when animated, seem to be off compared to the background art. They seem to move much faster than they should be. It's a blemish on what otherwise is a great anime. To deal with this, I just imagine it being animated in the spirit of Frieren or perhaps in older cel animation.That said, the overall positives of this anime outweigh the negatives.§ ConclusionAria the Animation is a wonderful anime to watch in the evening as you relax from the busy day of work. The CG animation leaves some to be desired, but it's not a deal breaker for anyone with an open mind and perhaps an open heart to experience the wonderful feelings each and every episode gives you."
Shuumatsu no Walküre,"this is like my second review or something like that. but i did drop this show, i just found it disrespectful in one way more than the other.the way they made Aphrodite appear in the show, i think it was disrespectful to change her whole body shape just to appeal to the audience. she didn’t have a big chest, she wasn’t abnormally skinny. i think changing the way someone looks shouldn’t be done for fanservice, especially not a greek god.i know that some gooners will like this depiction of her, and by all means, enjoy it. but that’s the only reason i dropped the show.i...can’t look past the disrespect of changing someone’s body type, especially when she’s supposed to be a little chubby and they slimmed her down to an average looking blond fan-service character."
Sousou no Frieren,"Frieren's overwhelmingly positive reception is mostly due to the hype and the memes associated with it rather than its own merits, as is evidenced by how discourse about the series completely fell off of a cliff shortly after its conclusion.Compare this to other shows in this site - FMA, Steins;Gate, Attack on Titan, Death Note, Higurashi, and so on, which still have people consistently talking and watching them to this day. Once you put aside the whole hype train, Frieren on its own is simply a standard (if not generic) fantasy show carried by its production quality and art, and it's quite apparent. Which...makes me believe most people (willingly? unwillingly?) imposed into this show a version of itself that does not exist. (though the discourse will come back once the second season airs, but it will inevitably be more muted)The supposed themes this show carries are at best vestigial. The themes of mortality, the passage of time, and ""learning how to live"" are only really present in the first two or three episodes, and from then onwards the show loses its philosophical depth. That's not inherently a bad thing, but tons of people pretend as if this is the anime version of Subahibi. It's not, and all the backstory and supposed depth given to the characters are eventually tossed aside for simplified versions made for audience appeal. It doesn't last a single episode - you learn their backstory and it's back to antics as usual. Frieren does le silly face! Fern is le pouting! Stark is getting le hit! Everything you learn about the main cast seems to be cosmetic, and (so far) does not really play into anything in a grander scale. The show appears unsure of what it wants to be, whether it be something deeper or something made for mass appeal, placing it in a weird limbo.This is not a bad show, but it's also not a *great* show. The things it tries to do have been done better elsewhere, and this series' popularity and framing makes me believe it will not have a conclusion anytime soon as it's in the best interests of the upper management to keep the ball running for as long as possible until revenue runs out, which can only really be bad for the story itself. My heart can only go out to Abe Tsukasa and Yamada Kanehito if this is really the case and not just me being a pessimistic cunt.Overall, I give this a ""mixed feelings"" because, at least for me, this is not what is advertised - which is not inherently a bad thing but when it's on the level of being rated far higher than so many actual greats, it kinda *has* to live up to these expectations. A decent to good show at best, which somehow ended up with people collectively imposing into it a masterpiece that does not exist."
Triage X,"Ignoring the constant fan service... which seems to be more relevant than the plot or character development, It's just a generic action anime. That wouldn't be a bad thing, necessarily, if it weren't for the aforementioned problem of fanservice being the primary focus of this show.If that's all one is looking for than they will likely enjoy it, but if you're looking for a good story, this isn't it. I will say some of the fight scenes were good, but all the other flaws make those easy to overlook.Backstories for most of the main characters were shown somewhat, but not always entirely fleshed...out. As mentioned earlier, it's a generic action movie plot."
Soukou Kihei Votoms,"It's a good concept plagued by slow pacing, a common issue with some of the older animes. The story overall is very interesting and the art for the action scenes are good, but sometimes the series tends to drag on more than necessary. Only one of the four arcs did not seem to have that issue.Not a bad watch for someone that is into Mecha, as this series is one of the godfathers of the genre, but not a series for those that don't have the patience for slow burn shows.For a fast-paced story within this universe, I highly recommend the OVA ""Armor...Hunter Mellowlink"". Watching the entirety of this show is not required to understand the plot of Mellowlink."
"Maou-sama, Retry! R","I gave the original season a 7/10, which was slightly higher than the average score; It was complete and utter trash, with some of the worst art and animation I've seen in anime, although overall, the season was held-up by just how trash it was. ""So bad it's good"" comes to mind.This season is actually worse, because it simply has no real redeeming qualities.After 7 episodes it's hard to even describe what's happening, the story seems to keep jumping around all over the place without any idea as to what it's actually trying to convey. It really doesn't help that the first 2 episodes...are mostly recapping season 1 and have some weird pre-reincarnation explanation thing going on that goes nowhere and don't really end up explaining anything.The art and animation are extremely ""generic isekai"", which means it doesn't have that same comedic trashiness the original series did either. A lot of the characters have also undergone severe redesigns here, losing any charm or ""waifu-ness"" the originals had. Even the ""girly-boy"" (referred to as such in S1) has been turned into an actual girl here (she/her pronouns used).The only thing even remotely holding this up so far, is that the writing is incredibly tongue in cheek and doesn't take itself seriously, which is thankfully a holdover from the original series and more props to the original manga/LN writer.Currently, this show is between a score of 4 or 5 for me, sitting on the fence between mediocrity and being plain bad. I'll keep watching out of morbid curiosity, but I wouldn't recommend this to most."
Fairy Tail: 100-nen Quest,"It feels nice to watch Fairy tail again and have fun with ambience and characters.Not much has changed. I miss great music that anime had but it is not bad now just different.Also not much has changed can be bad since there is no character development, but I in general missed the old characters.It has all flaws that Fairy tail used to have, and it is done maybe even more exaggerated but I had fun watching it.I do think that people who haven't seen Fairy tail could watch this separately but I would not recommend. Because it is hard to meet characters the...right way.Animation is ok, nothing special but not bad.I would recommend the show to those who watched it and enjoyed before, but not that much to new people"
The Legend of Heroes: Sen no Kiseki - Northern War,"firstly overall is really good to me, the art the story me as sen no kiseki fans i really like this anime. i've been waiting for this game to come out as anime. but i liitle disappointed at first because this story is different from the main story but im okay with it after watching it cuz they show us the story that didn't appeared at main story (game).  as for those who lost you should watch the game first cuz this anime show the other side story not the main story but still connecting with main story. for those who want fully understand...the lore u should watch the game first sen no kiseki 1 & 2 then watch this anime.  that all from me sorry if my english is bad im not really good at it"
Make Heroine ga Oosugiru!,"Titles that openly state the satirical nature of their show tend to give off a suspicious scent—a scent usually associated with cheap trope-flips and light novel adaptations. And well, if that's what you're expecting from this show too? You might be in for a surprise...First ImpressionsImmediately, all expectations were defied. In a brief moment of bedazzlement, I almost thought I accidentally booted up a Shinkai film or some new KyoAni original.Detailed, cinematic environment shots with heavily produced sound design over some lofty introductory narration instantly shifted my expectations, as I now almost anticipated some kind of heartfelt arthouse masterpiece for the ages.And for as much...praise as I can shower on its presentation (which does remain consistent throughout the show)… a masterpiece is most certainly not what this was.In fact, almost nothing about this show was as I expected it to be… aside from its tragic slavery to the Evil Gods of copy-pasted light novel story beats.Story and CharactersRomance comedy?I suppose it technically passes as one.Trope-y Web Novel asset flip?It has the same grooves, but follows its own tune enough to escape that pitfall.There are plenty of merits to the storytelling here, and it takes many praise-worthy risks in how it handles relationships. The three titular heroines, for example, never develop romantic feelings for our protagonist. In fact, he hardly takes much of a role in the story at all outside of being their sounding board.Makes sense, seeing as almost the entire 12 episodes are dedicated to moving on from their heartbreaks in various ways...A deeper problem that I hope will resolve in later seasons is the all-important question of... why?I watched 3 episodes of an annoying blue-haired girl pestering the main character, just so she could become slightly less annoying.I watched 3 episodes of the only somewhat normal character being normal, just for her to be handwaved out of the limelight for... ever.I watched 6 episodes of a generic obligatory School Culture Festival preparation arc, all for a relatively lukewarm payoff.Not that I didn't enjoy it, it just felt... pointless, at the end. The plus side is that it was always very pleasing to look at and listen to... but even so.The ExecutionIt is almost never satisfying.It is almost never ""realistic"" as the dialogue would beg you to believe (though the world does maintain a baseline level of believable maturity that I respect).It rarely even carries emotional weight, because every emotional climax is caused by some extraordinary contrivance that completely shatters your suspension of disbelief.Not to mention the sometimes grotesquely extra character acting that occurs at some of these emotional heights—characters flailing about like Gary’s Mod rag dolls, maximizing their APM on facial contortions and weird gestures. People do not act like this.NOTE: I do actually appreciate the effort put into these scenes. I believe it is anime's divine right to have goofy, over-the-top character acting. However, I personally could not get immersed when characters were acting this bizarre, especially when I'm meant to be sympathizing with said characters during an intense emotional scene.In all honesty, this show would be nearly unwatchable if it weren't for the stellar production team behind it, who find a way to elevate the most excruciatingly boring scenes into something genuinely interesting.Incredible musical backing, incredible intros and outros, constantly dynamic shot composition, sakuga for some reason?!—the list goes on.Final ThoughtsThat being said, I'll probably edit this review later when I find some stuff to praise about the show. There should be a lot, I think. Because for some reason, I can't bring myself to rate this lower than an 8.Score: 8/10"
Cardfight!! Vanguard: Legion Mate-hen,"I’m so mortified that this is from the same writer as the A Channel anime, I want to put my head through a wall. The entire premise of this season seems to be based on the series compositor having taken a trip to London and sat in a pub listening to people talk. This season has no style, no substance, plot holes you could throw whole buildings through and utterly unlikeable characters with motivations that are more implausible than any conspiracy theory to ever exist. I’m so glad that G moves on to a whole new set of characters because I couldn’t stand to be...with these characters any longer. Just as long as I don’t have to listen to anyone try to force British slang spoken in English into any more anime because repeatedly hearing them say mate was utterly grating."
"Ore wa Subete wo ""Parry"" suru: Gyaku Kanchigai no Sekai Saikyou wa Boukensha ni Naritai","I really like isekai animes, including this one. This anime follows a pretty standard isekai plot, so there's nothing too impressive or unique about it. I would’ve rated it higher, but there’s one thing that almost made me drop it.First, the music, animation, voice acting, etc., are all good—no more, no less. I really enjoyed all of that in this anime, and when I first saw the rating was below 7, I questioned why. Do people really hate isekai anime that much? But then, after I watched six episodes, I understood why the rating is like that.The MC is really frustratingly stupid—not in the way...that he acts without thinking or causes trouble for others. He’s actually a decent guy who helps people as much as he can. But he always seems to 'misunderstand' things that would be hard to miss as a viewer.He wants to become an adventurer since he was a child but doesn’t even know the basics of the job: like what types of animals exist, and how strong each animals/monster are, what demons are, etc. He actually mistakes a giant salamander-like creature for a frog, who would even think that? It’s like he’s never seen an actual frog before, and this kind of thing happens a lot. He lacks the basic knowledge an adventurer needs, despite having wanted to be one since childhood.I’ll admit there are some 'misunderstanding' moments in this anime that are more acceptable.If you like isekai anime, I recommend this one—but only if you have plenty of time to spare and no other anime to watch."
Aru Nihon no Ekaki Shounen,"Anyone who is creative can appreciate the beauty of this.Im so into this multimedia animation style so at the first minutes of this movie it was a instant match for me.-To be honest im suprised with how they nicely use the autism as a approach of loving the art you do.-It was upbringing and passionate, lots of love into this short movie, you can feel it.-The quality of production couldnt follow to animated ones when it comes to unanimated scenes. But i can see why, its a low budget indie project so i dont want to be too harsh about it.-Actors did their...job-Plot is really sweet.Last words: Definetly give it a shot and support these guys. They know the struggle of art."
Bocchi the Rock!,"If there’s a series that drastically changed my perspective on slice-of-life forever then my vote would go to Bocchi the Rock. This series managed to shatter my expectations so hard when I first got into it. To put it in perspective, it takes all of the aspects most other SoL anime have and puts them to newfound heights. That isn’t to trash on the others, it would obviously be unfair if that’s the case, but BTR is on a completely different level for me. From the storytelling, directing, music, and character writing, there’s just so much gold and diamond to be found in the mines....Not only does it massively stand out from SoLs/CGDCTs, but it also hits the point where it’s my personal favorite anime of all time.The series starts with Gotoh Hitori (will be shortened to “Bocchi” from here) who rarely has any friends and lacks communication abilities. She plays a guitar and has wanted to join a band since her middle school years. But again, she doesn’t communicate as much so she practices guitar by herself. Eventually, though, she uploaded videos of her being a guitarist as well as joining Kessoku Band right after. This series already has a rocky start since it sets up its story. We already see how Bocchi is written throughout the story. She has been a loner despite how skilled she can be at playing her guitar. She tries to make new friends but the problem is that her communication skills are flawed, even now with the help of Nijika, Ryo, and Kita. BTR surely had a very strong start and it’s only getting stronger from here. How the entire story is built may look relatively simplistic at first glance and while that still may be the case, in this respect, everything about it is very comprehensive and profound despite how short its runtime can be.Contrary to popular belief, BTR isn’t really about relatability. No, no, no, whoever says it misses out the whole point. While the whole relatability aspect is indeed important and plays well in the show (even if I could personally barely relate to any of the characters), the main messages of this series are both the complicated nature of communication and how friendship can be healthy regardless of troubles. Communication is both explained and portrayed very well for a few reasons. Bocchi is an introvert and in this respect, she has trouble trying to make friends properly. Even with the success she gains, she’s still kind of unstable and for the most part, she will tend to have quite some trouble. This isn’t the most accurate display by any means but it still shows us how communication is difficult well. Communicating with people, especially when making friends, is relatively hard. You still need to practice how you talk and how you manipulate your body expressions. The best part about this is even though Bocchi will not be perfect at talking to people, she still slowly improves over time with the help of Kessoku Band.As for the friendship aspect, it’s also amazing. In fact, it intertwines with the “communication is hard” element super well. Looking back at how Bocchi slowly gains confidence because of Kessoku Band, the reason for that is how dedicated the members are. Not just with music (which we will go over later) but also with how they develop communication all together. We have two introverts and two extroverts, the former being Bocchi and Ryo and the latter being Nijika and Kita. Nijika and Kita (although mainly Nijika) wanted to help Bocchi and Ryo with talking to people but those two still have their own weaknesses. Again, Bocchi still has trouble with communicating while Ryo prefers to be a loner. Either way, those two are still learning how to find improvements. Despite this, Nijika wouldn’t dare to punish them. This aspect is equally as well-explored because Kessoku Band members are friends with each other and they point out their highs and lows. The series doesn’t take any of it seriously because neither of them would find their meaning if they stuck with one mindset. It isn’t just amazing, but also narratively healthy in that regard.So how do these two elements succeed in all of those processes? The answer is direction. The direction is the sole reason why the story keeps on getting stronger. We already talked about how the communication aspect and the friendship aspect are presented excellently. The direction of the series goes through the other important aspects just as greatly. We also see how Kessoku Band was made in the first place. Kessoku Band’s name may be a pun but its entire existence has both a compelling history and presence. Nijika is the founder and she designed the whole band because not only does she want to show people she makes friends with how communication can be answered depending on your personal success but also to show what music means to people. The exploration of the band is fantastic because of its history, its legacy, and how its members communicate with each other. The band isn’t the only amazing part of the direction, though. We also see how other characters approach both their lives and their purposes very nicely. Some examples include how Seika (and even her adult friends) monitor over Kessoku Band.The comedy also plays a very crucial part in the show. Now, I should admit that the humor is arguably the weakest part but that doesn’t really mean it falls short. Not even one bit. Hear me out, the comedy isn’t always reliant on being relatable and is presented in a way that even extroverted people can understand and laugh at. The humor here shows how introverts have a hard time talking to other people properly. Some examples include how the moment Bocchi shows her meme expressions, which also shows that she would have trouble trying to talk normally. This doesn’t seem too great at first. When I first watched it, even I was confused with how the humor was constructed. But looking again at how it goes, there’s a lot of value to it. The point about BTR’s comedy is that it actually shows how making failed attempts (or struggling ones) can be genuinely funny and once again, this is handled very well without too much trouble or any bit of offense ‘ahem’ at least imho. Comedy is always subjective, even in comedic stories, but BTR manages to make its humor a crucial element in the best ways possible.Lastly, we can’t forget about music. Music in slice-of-life anime (at least ones whose themes focus on musical bands) is weird. Some use music to its high potential, others rarely gave a shit about it. But BTR not only gave the music aspect a chance but is also dedicated to investing in the tracks, mainly the performances. The music performed by our main band is entertaining and heartwarming, but most importantly, it narrates one of the story’s main points to newfound heights. The music is proof that the Kessoku Band members are very dedicated to one of their main objectives. Even if they’re not perfect at making music, they still show so much heart and so much passion. The performances are a result of how the Kessoku Band members care about each other, share their sweet moments with each other, and how they point out their individual skills. It’s also proof that music in general is more than a piece of entertainment. Music can also be something like a comfort zone or a lesson.Now, for characters, starting with Bocchi the introverted guitarist, Nijika the extroverted drummer and leader, Ryo the introverted bassist, and Kita the extroverted singer and guitarist. Bocchi is an excellent protagonist. She’s a very valuable example of how introverts have trouble while still finding a bit of improvement. She’s shy and clumsy, and yet, she’s still skilled at playing a guitar. What makes her a compelling main character is how she learns from her main friends. Even though she’s still on her introverted side, she slowly gained confidence by having loads of fun and enticing communication. Hell, not just with the main cast but also the side cast, especially Seika, PA, Kikuri, and her family. That being said, she’s actually my least favorite of the 4 main girls. Don’t get me wrong, she’s still well-written. She has great characterization, development, and chemistry with any character. After all, she deserves to be named after her own series. It’s just that we have even better characters coming right up.Speaking of, Nijika is extremely compelling. Her energy, her dedication, and how she designs her band alone already make her very profound. But again, there’s far more to her character. Her interactions with Kessoku Band as a whole are amazing. Showing them how band members are always determined with their skills based on their individual instrument choices no matter what trouble gets in their way is both cathartic and inspirational. Her relationship with Seika also adds to her character greatly as they want to help each other but also point out whether things are going nicely for them or not. Sure, it can also be comedic but most of the time, it still narrates Nijika’s development well. A similar case can be said with Kita. Although not as compelling as Nijika, she’s still a fantastic character for similar reasons. Fantastic chemistry, fantastic development, and fantastic catharsis. Not much needed to say here honestly.But if there’s one character I adore the most, that would be Ryo for me. Ryo is by far the biggest standout out of the 4 main girls for a few but massive reasons. For starters, she actually has a dark history with how she was with a band prior to moving to Kessoku Band. She wanted to perform more and more with that band but ended up leaving due to creative differences with her former members. She’s now a loner and she chose that, even after gaining confidence from the other Kessoku Band members. What makes her such a brilliantly written and developed character is her relationship with the cast. She can act goofy but it adds to her character and how she occasionally needs it for her personal progression. The best part about her is that she has two perspectives. She shows how selfish she can be at times, even if admits it, and how she observes and analyzes the pure creativity of a band. Ryo is sarcastic but she’s also wise and reserving with both her personal knowledge and chemistry with any character, and that’s why she’s the best character in the whole series.We can’t forget about the side characters. Even those people have a lot to show and add to the main cast very well without being close to plot devices. You have Serika, PA-san, Kikuri, Bocchi’s family, and many more. They’re one of the reasons why the character writing is very strong and why the main cast has such profound development and catharsis. Serika is a great example of this. As mentioned, she monitors Kessoku Band and has a complicated but also very believable relationship with Nijika. My personal favorite side character, though, is Kikuri. Kikuri is hilarious in how she approaches the band members and the adults that monitor said band. Sure, it can be awkward but it still gives me good laughs. But also, that makes her greatly written, even for a side character, because of her personal knowledge of a band and she’s an OG bassist.The animation is surprisingly solid for the most part. Not groundbreaking or anything but it was straight to the point. The movements when the main girls perform a band are very nice, to say it, albeit heavy-handed at times. The character designs are criminally underrated. The school, even though it still requires you to wear the exact and intended uniforms, gives you the freedom to have the extra choice of clothing, giving any character more personality and recognizability with both their silhouettes and how they wear something that matches their interests. Bonus points for the extra worldbuilding. The music that isn’t connected to the performances is just as great. Each track conveys each sequence very nicely. The same can be said with the sound design which is also well done. It’s no wonder why some of the most iconic scenes around Bocchi losing her shit became beloved memes. Lastly, the voice acting is amazing as each voice actor nails each of their character’s characteristics and sequences amazingly. Some of my personal favorite performances include Hasegawa Ikumi as Kita, Mizuno Saku as Ryo, and Senbongi Sayaka as Kikuri. All voice performances are equally great, though.Say what you will about this series but after these talks, I can proudly say that Bocchi the Rock ruined anime for me. Not just slice of life or CGDCT but in general. It’s the jack-of-all-trades and master-of-all, a combination you rarely see in the industry. It’s filled with cohesive passion with how it directs its storytelling, comedy, and character-writing. Even if one of those is the weakest, that being the show’s humor, every aspect is equally nailed so brilliantly. I don’t know what else I could say, it’s just amazing in every sense of pattern. That said, BTR isn’t for everyone. Even with everything I say, you will still find this show awkward depending on your perspective. But as to how I personally view it, there’s no way I would absolutely let go of this unforgettable masterpiece. Not even close."
Dead Dead Demons Dededede Destruction (OVA),"Dedo Dedo Dede Dede... One hell of a name, isn't it?This show is a lot of things, it is so many things that the most elaborate review of it on this website is incredibly long. But in short; it is cute (almost chibi) girls living their cute slice of life lives juxtaposed against a gritty, realistic first contact scenario in which everything goes wrong.It is this contrast that I found surprisingly real. Life changes incredibly slowly, it takes years for one to notice but it's always dynamic. One day, aliens arrive. Three years later, people who were 14 when the massive mothership appeared over Tokyo...are graduating high school, enrolling in college, looking for jobs and getting into relationships. But the UFO is still there, seemingly unchanged, part of the scenery, almost. All the while the country slowly shifts into militarism, the more radical members of society begin forming groups of opposing views, tension grows and people die.Another thing that was a very pleasant surprise to me is how modern it is. Anime tends to be old-fashioned, eschewing phones as devices to call or text others and that's it. Here you have the girls play first-person shooter games, browse SNS, one of the characters makes a living through the internet, an AI is present who's largely reminiscent of modern language models rather than the classic sci-fi 'basically a human with a voicebox'. This is perhaps the first SOL anime I have seen that made me feel like it's actually set in the year I'm watching it in (in more ways than one).I can barely withhold a real life comparison that is relevant to the current situation in the world (at the time of writing this review), but I feel like it is no place to bring up politics. Even if that would help explain why I feel the way I do about this anime. It is one of best releases of 2024 that you will never hear about.PS. Unlike many others, I will say that the ending impressed me greatly, it is both unexpected and draws a fine line under everything that happened. I would call it most literally, a wrap-up.PPS. Don't make the Haruhi mistake, watch it in the broadcast order, episode 0 is there for a reason."
"Ima, Soko ni Iru Boku","What is war? Is it necessary? Are there any victors?Well, To answer that question, You must experience this grounded and dark story that is by no means meant for children (Despite how it looks). This is a very dark anime that deals with some serious subjects, War, Abuse, Child abuse, Rape and Personality disorders. These are some of the things which are shown in the series so beware if you get triggered easily.Animation/Art :  Really great tbh. Blew me away especially the vibe that the anime sets early on. Really grips you in. The art has an old charm to it tbh. Although it...can feel dated obviously but I think one shouldn't put this anime down or demerit it for it's animation. For its time, The anime looked amazing probably. There are also these moments in the anime where some character take a long pause before doing something or doing something. This keeps you glued to the screen and builds anticipation. The Villain is very hate-able and insufferable lol.Story : A really fantasy based story with an overly optimistic yet likable main character that you honestly can't help but like him. At times the MC is so blindingly optimistic that even I as a viewer am baffled but to see his breakdown and despair was sad aswell. It's a A point to B point story which takes no shortcuts. The supporting cast it also used well here that you actually feel for them.While the story is not perfect, It was pretty good for what it offered. A short and simple anime that you can watch over the weekend and which will keep you hungry for more because the thriller and drama aspect is executed very well.Sound design : The Ost and sounds mesh really well with the scenery and the scene being showed. Melodramatic Ost for a Melodramatic anime.The beginning is also very exciting and sets the tone for the entire series. The ending, could have been better but I didn't hate it or anything. I was content with what was shown and that's a good thing imo.All in all a very solid watch, I'd recommend this to people who can stomach some mature stuff. This was a pleasant surprise and I honestly wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did haha. I usually don't binge anime nowadays but if I do then that means they're engaging enough and this one certainly checks that box.To top it all off, A self contained story within 13 episodes?! Sign me up anyday! :)Definitely give this one a try, You'll be surprised!"
Jigokuraku,"The show has an interesting setting. A group of criminals and their overseers are sent to an island that is supposed to be a mixture of Buddhist and Taoist heaven. Their goal is to retrieve the elixir of life to obtain a pardon from the Shogun. The problem is, although this island looks really pretty with all the flowers and colors, it is the farthest thing from Heaven. Everything tries to kill you in a brutal but colorful way. The animation is pretty good in that regard.However, that's where the good stops. The characters are really boring and cliche. They are well animated, but you...better hope they never start talking because you start to realize you are watching pretty looking trash. Almost everyone who is not a male is sexualized. Besides the original concept and good animation, I can't find much to praise."
Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai Specials,"If you've seen Oreimo, you can probably extrapolate what you thought about S1 here.Broadly speaking, I thought Oreimo was funny and had a good cast and could be touching at times and I agree with that in these specials too.However, this is more Ore...The first episode is the ~true~ ending to S1 (which kind of hurts S1 in retrospect since now there's just a random episode there to hedge your bets that can now be discarded) and it was fine. I kinda skipped around since a lot of it is just repurposed from the end of S1 but I got the main jist of it.The...second episode is where it starts cooking.If you are a Kuroneko fan, you will be eating good here. I like Kuroneko but she's probably my least favorite of the main girls? She's not bad but I never really got the spark between her and Kyousuke and this did not change over the course of these specials.The main thing I think makes these specials pop is the new character, Sena. I wouldn't mind if they brought her into the fold with Kirino and Kuroneko and Saori, she provides a new layer of imouto power to the series since Kuroneko is Big Sis and SaoriAnyway, I thought she had the best joke in the specials, perhaps even the whole series up to this point, obviously I won't spoil it but yeah, I think she has her own niche which would fit in alongside the imouto pervert, chuuni dork, and... uh... whatever Saori watches? She was building a mech in one episode so I'm headcanoning her as a Gundam fan.Other than that, I appreciate that they do a little more with the game development club. Oreimo S1's novelist arc kinda lost me when Kirino went from legitimately terrible, unreadable garbage to published novelist in the same episode so seeing Kuroneko and Sena actually having to work together (to make something recognized as shit, no less) is actually such an improvement.The Imo finally comes back in the final episode and honestly, I kind of missed her presence in these specials, so it was nice to see.I think these specials heavily depend on two questions:1. How much do you like Oreimo2. How much do you like KuronekoIf you like Oreimo a lot, check it out. As someone who may or may not have accidentally watched a few episodes of Oreimo S2 before watching these specials, you're going to need it.If you like Kuroneko, definitely check it out.I'd imagine if you're reading a review for the SPECIALS of Oreimo, you should probably check this out unless you really don't like Kuroneko.Even if you don't like Oreimo because of Kirino specifically, Kirino isn't in this a whole lot so you can enjoy what Oreimo could be if Kirino was just Thanos snapped off the face of the planet."
